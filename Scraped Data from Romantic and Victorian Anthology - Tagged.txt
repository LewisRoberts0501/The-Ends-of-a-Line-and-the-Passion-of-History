    <title>To the South Downs (Elegiac Sonnets)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, hills beloved! where once, a happy child,</line>
      <line>Your beechen shades, ‘your turf, your flowers among’,</line>
      <line>I wove your bluebells into garlands wild,</line>
      <line>And woke your echoes with my artless song –</line>
      <line>Ah, hills beloved! your turf, your flowers, remain,</line>
      <line>But can they peace to this sad breast restore –</line>
      <line>For one poor moment soothe the sense of pain,</line>
      <line>And teach a breaking heart to throb no more?</line>
      <line>And you, Aruna, in the vale below,</line>
      <line>O As to the sea your limpid waves you bear,</line>
      <line>Can you one kind Lethean cup bestow</line>
      <line>To drink a long oblivion to my care?</line>
      <line>Ah no! when all, e’en hope’s last ray, is gone,</line>
      <line>There’s no oblivion – but in death alone.</line>

      <line>Cauld blew the bitter-biting north</line>
      <line>Upon thy early, humble birth;</line>
      <line> Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth</line>
      <line>Amid the storm,</line>
      <line>Scarce reared above the parent-earth</line>
      <line>Thy tender form.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>The flaunting flowers our gardens yield,</line>

      <line>O’ clod or stane,</line>
      <line>Adorns the histie stibble-field,</line>
      <line>Unseen, alane.</line>

      <line>There, in thy scanty mantle clad,</line>

      <line>Stern Ruin’s plough-share drives elate,</line>
      <line>Full on thy bloom,</line>
      <line>Till crushed beneath the furrow’s weight</line>
      <line>Shall be thy doom!</line>

    <title>A London Summer Morning</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who has not waked to list the busy sounds</line>
      <line>Of summer morning in the sultry smoke</line>
      <line>Of noisy London? On the pavement hot</line>
      <line>The sooty chimney-boy, with dingy face</line>
      <line>And tattered covering, shrilly hawks his trade,</line>
      <line>Rousing the sleepy housemaid. At the door</line>
      <line>The milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell</line>
      <line>Proclaims the dustman’s office, while the street</line>
      <line>Is lost in clouds impervious. Now begins</line>
      <line>O The din of hackney coaches, wagons, carts;</line>
      <line>While tin-men’s shops, and noisy trunk-makers,</line>
      <line>Knife-grinders, coopers, squealing cork-cutters,</line>
      <line>Fruit-barrows, and the hunger-giving cries</line>
      <line>Of vegetable vendors, fill the air.</line>
      <line>Now every shop displays its varied trade,</line>
      <line>And the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet</line>
      <line>Of early walkers. At the private door</line>
      <line>The ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop,</line>
      <line>Annoying the smart ’prentice, or neat girl</line>
      <line>O Tripping with bandbox lightly. Now the sun</line>
      <line>Darts burning splendour on the glittering pane,</line>
      <line>Save where the canvas awning throws a shade</line>
      <line>On the gay merchandise. Now spruce and trim</line>
      <line>In shops where beauty smiles with industry,</line>
      <line> Sits the smart damsel, while the passenger</line>
      <line>Peeps through the window, watching every charm.</line>
      <line>Now pastry dainties catch the eyes minute</line>
      <line>Of hummy insects, while the slimy snare</line>
      <line>Waits to enthral them. Now the lamp-lighter</line>
      <line>O Mounts the slight ladder, nimbly venturous,</line>
      <line>To trim the half-filled lamp, while at his feet</line>
      <line>The pot-boy yells discordant. All along</line>
      <line>The sultry pavement, the old-clothes man cries</line>
      <line>In tone monotonous, and sidelong views</line>
      <line>The area for his traffic. Now the bag</line>
      <line>Is slily opened, and the half-worn suit</line>
      <line>(Sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base</line>
      <line>Domestic spoiler) for one half its worth</line>
      <line>Sinks in the green abyss. The porter now</line>
      <line>O Bears his huge load along the burning way,</line>
      <line>And the poor poet wakes from busy dreams</line>
      <line>To paint the summer morning.</line>

    <title>Kubla Khan</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</line>
      <line>A stately pleasure-dome decree,</line>
      <line>Where Alph the sacred river ran</line>
      <line>Through caverns measureless to man</line>
      <line>Down to a sunless sea.</line>
      <line>So twice five miles of fertile ground</line>
      <line>With walls and towers were girdled round –</line>
      <line>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,</line>
      <line>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</line>
      <line>O And here were forests ancient as the hills,</line>
      <line>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But oh, that deep romantic chasm, which slanted</line>
      <line>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</line>
      <line>A savage place, as holy and enchanted</line>
      <line> As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted</line>
      <line>By woman wailing for her demon lover!</line>
      <line>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething</line>
      <line>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</line>
      <line>A mighty fountain momently was forced,</line>
      <line>O Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst</line>
      <line>Huge fragments vaulted, like rebounding hail</line>
      <line>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail;</line>
      <line>And mid these dancing rocks, at once and ever,</line>
      <line>It flung up momently the sacred river.</line>
      <line> Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</line>
      <line>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</line>
      <line>Then reached the caverns measureless to man</line>
      <line>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean –</line>
      <line>And mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</line>
      <line>O Ancestral voices prophesying war!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The shadow of the dome of pleasure</line>
      <line>Floated midway on the waves,</line>
      <line>Where was heard the mingled measure</line>
      <line>From the fountain and the caves.</line>
      <line> It was a miracle of rare device –</line>
      <line>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A damsel with a dulcimer</line>
      <line>In a vision once I saw:</line>
      <line>It was an Abyssinian maid,</line>
      <line>O And on her dulcimer she played</line>
      <line>Singing of Mount Abora.</line>
      <line>Could I revive within me</line>
      <line>Her symphony and song,</line>
      <line>To such a deep delight ’twould win me,</line>
      <line>That with music loud and long</line>
      <line>I would build that dome in air –</line>
      <line>That sunny dome, those caves of ice!</line>
      <line>And all who heard should see them there,</line>
      <line>And all should cry ‘Beware! Beware!’</line>
      <line>O His flashing eyes, his floating hair!</line>
      <line>Weave a circle round him thrice,</line>
      <line>And close your eyes with holy dread,</line>
      <line>For he on honey-dew hath fed</line>
      <line>And drunk the milk of Paradise.</line>

    <title>Old Familiar Faces</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I had a mother, but she died, and left me,</line>
      <line>Died prematurely in a day of horrors –</line>
      <line>All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I have had playmates, I have had companions,</line>
      <line>In my days of childhood, in my joyful schooldays –</line>
      <line>All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have been laughing, I have been carousing,</line>
      <line>Drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies;</line>
      <line>O All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I loved a love once, fairest among women;</line>
      <line>Closed are her doors on me, I must not see her –</line>
      <line>All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man;</line>
      <line> Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly,</line>
      <line>Left him, to muse on the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ghost-like, I paced round the haunts of my childhood.</line>
      <line>Earth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse,</line>
      <line>Seeking to find the old familiar faces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O Friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother,</line>
      <line>Why wert not thou born in my father’s dwelling?</line>
      <line>So might we talk of the old familiar faces –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How some they have died, and some they have left me,</line>
      <line>And some are taken from me – all are departed –</line>
      <line>All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</line>

    <title>Lucy Gray</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oft had I heard of Lucy Gray,</line>
      <line>And when I crossed the wild</line>
      <line>I chanced to see at break of day</line>
      <line>The solitary child.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> No mate, no comrade, Lucy knew:</line>
      <line>She dwelt on a wild moor,</line>
      <line>The sweetest thing that ever grew</line>
      <line>Beside a human door!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet you may spy the fawn at play,</line>
      <line>O The hare upon the green,</line>
      <line>But the sweet face of Lucy Gray</line>
      <line>Will never more be seen.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Tonight will be a stormy night,</line>
      <line>You to the town must go,</line>
      <line> And take a lantern, child, to light</line>
      <line>Your mother through the snow.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘That, father, will I gladly do,</line>
      <line>’Tis scarcely afternoon!</line>
      <line>The minster-clock has just struck two,</line>
      <line>O And yonder is the moon.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At this the father raised his hook</line>
      <line>And snapped a faggot-band;</line>
      <line>He plied his work, and Lucy took</line>
      <line>The lantern in her hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Not blither is the mountain-roe:</line>
      <line>With many a wanton stroke</line>
      <line>Her feet disperse the powdery snow</line>
      <line>That rises up like smoke.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The storm came on before its time;</line>
      <line>O She wandered up and down,</line>
      <line>And many a hill did Lucy climb</line>
      <line>But never reached the town.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wretched parents all that night</line>
      <line>Went shouting far and wide,</line>
      <line> But there was neither sound nor sight</line>
      <line>To serve them for a guide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At daybreak on a hill they stood</line>
      <line>That overlooked the moor,</line>
      <line>And thence they saw the bridge of wood</line>
      <line>O A furlong from their door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now they homeward turned, and cried,</line>
      <line>‘In Heaven we all shall meet’ –</line>
      <line>When in the snow the mother spied</line>
      <line>The print of Lucy’s feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Then downward from the steep hill’s edge</line>
      <line>They tracked the footmarks small,</line>
      <line>And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,</line>
      <line>And by the long stone wall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then an open field they crossed –</line>
      <line>O The marks were still the same –</line>
      <line>They tracked them on, nor ever lost,</line>
      <line>And to the bridge they came.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They followed from the snowy bank</line>
      <line>The footmarks one by one,</line>
      <line> Into the middle of the plank,</line>
      <line>And further there were none.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet some maintain that to this day</line>
      <line>She is a living child,</line>
      <line>That you may see sweet Lucy Gray</line>
      <line>O Upon the lonesome wild.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O’er rough and smooth she trips along</line>
      <line>And never looks behind,</line>
      <line>And sings a solitary song</line>
      <line>That whistles in the wind.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Strange fits of passion I have known,</line>
      <line>And I will dare to tell</line>

      <line>Beneath the evening moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upon the moon I fixed my eye</line>
      <line>O All over the wide lea;</line>

      <line>Those paths so dear to me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now we reached the orchard-plot,</line>
      <line>And as we climbed the hill</line>
      <line> Towards the roof of Lucy’s cot</line>
      <line>The moon descended still.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In one of those sweet dreams I slept,</line>
      <line>Kind Nature’s gentlest boon,</line>
      <line>And all the while my eyes I kept</line>
      <line>O On the descending moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My horse moved on – hoof after hoof</line>
      <line>He raised and never stopped –</line>
      <line>When down behind the cottage-roof</line>
      <line>At once the planet dropped.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> What fond and wayward thoughts will slide</line>
      <line>Into a lover’s head:</line>
      <line>‘Oh mercy’, to myself I cried,</line>
      <line>‘If Lucy should be dead!’</line>

      <line>Of mute insensate things.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The floating clouds their state shall lend</line>

      <line>Grace that shall mould the maiden’s form</line>

      <line> The stars of midnight shall be dear</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And vital feelings of delight</line>
      <line>Shall rear her form to stately height,</line>
      <line>Her virgin bosom swell –</line>

      <line>The memory of what has been</line>
      <line>And never more will be.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>On Linden, when the sun was low,</line>
      <line>All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,</line>
      <line>And dark as winter was the flow</line>
      <line>Of Iser, rolling rapidly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But Linden saw another sight</line>
      <line>When the drum beat at dead of night,</line>
      <line>Commanding fires of death to light</line>
      <line>The darkness of her scenery.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By torch and trumpet fast arrayed,</line>
      <line>O Each horseman drew his battle-blade,</line>
      <line>And furious every charger neighed</line>
      <line>To join the dreadful revelry!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then shook the hills with thunder riven,</line>
      <line>Then rushed the steed to battle driven,</line>
      <line> And louder than the bolts of heaven</line>
      <line>Far flashed the red artillery!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But redder yet that light shall glow</line>
      <line>On Linden’s hills of stainéd snow,</line>

      <line>Of Iser, rolling rapidly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis morn, but scarce yon level sun</line>

      <line>Shout in their sulphurous canopy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The combat deepens. On, ye brave,</line>

      <line>Few, few shall part where many meet!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,</line>
      <line>The ship was still as she could be,</line>
      <line>Her sails from heaven received no motion,</line>
      <line>Her keel was steady in the ocean.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Without either sign or sound of their shock</line>
      <line>The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock:</line>
      <line>So little they rose, so little they fell,</line>
      <line>They did not move the Inchcape Bell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Abbot of Aberbrothok</line>
      <line>O Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock –</line>
      <line>On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,</line>
      <line>And over the waves its warning rung.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell</line>
      <line>The mariners heard the warning bell;</line>
      <line> And then they knew the perilous Rock,</line>
      <line>And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun in heaven was shining gay,</line>
      <line>All things were joyful on that day:</line>
      <line>The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled around,</line>
      <line>O And there was joyance in their sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The buoy of the Inchcape Rock was seen,</line>
      <line>A darker speck on the ocean green;</line>
      <line>Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,</line>
      <line>And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He felt the cheering power of spring,</line>
      <line>It made him whistle, it made him sing;</line>
      <line>His heart was mirthful to excess,</line>
      <line>But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His eye was on the Inchcape float –</line>
      <line>O Quoth he, ‘My men, put out the boat,</line>
      <line>And row me to the Inchcape Rock,</line>
      <line>And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,</line>
      <line>And to the Inchcape Rock they go;</line>
      <line> Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,</line>
      <line>And he cut the Bell from the Inchcape float!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Down sunk the Bell with a gurgling sound,</line>
      <line>The bubbles rose and burst around;</line>
      <line>Quoth Sir Ralph, ‘The next who comes to the Rock</line>
      <line>O Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away,</line>
      <line>He scoured the seas for many a day;</line>
      <line>And now, grown rich with plundered store,</line>
      <line>He steers his course for Scotland’s shore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky</line>
      <line>They cannot see the sun on high;</line>
      <line>The wind hath blown a gale all day,</line>
      <line>At evening it hath died away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the deck the Rover takes his stand,</line>
      <line>O So dark it is they see no land;</line>
      <line>Quoth Sir Ralph, ‘It will be lighter soon,</line>
      <line>For there is the dawn of the rising moon.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Canst hear’, said one, ‘the breakers roar?</line>
      <line>For methinks we should be near the shore.’</line>
      <line> ‘Now where we are I cannot tell,</line>
      <line>But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They hear no sound, the swell is strong,</line>
      <line>Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,</line>
      <line>Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock –</line>
      <line>O ‘Oh Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair –</line>
      <line>He cursed himself in his despair –</line>
      <line>The waves rush in on every side,</line>
      <line>The ship is sinking beneath the tide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But even in his dying fear</line>
      <line>One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,</line>
      <line>A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell</line>
      <line>The Devil below was ringing his knell!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh young Lochinvar is come out of the west,</line>
      <line>Through all the wide Border his steed was the best,</line>
      <line>And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none –</line>
      <line>He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone.</line>
      <line> So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,</line>
      <line>There never was knight like the young Lochinvar!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,</line>
      <line>He swam the Esk river where ford there was none;</line>
      <line>But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,</line>
      <line>O The bride had consented – the gallant came late!</line>
      <line>For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,</line>
      <line>Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,</line>
      <line>Among bride’s-men, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all;</line>
      <line> Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword</line>
      <line>(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word),</line>
      <line>‘Oh come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,</line>
      <line>Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘I long wooed your daughter – my suit you denied –</line>
      <line>O Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide,</line>
      <line>And now am I come, with this lost love of mine</line>
      <line>To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.</line>
      <line>There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,</line>
      <line>That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The bride kissed the goblet, the knight took it up –</line>
      <line>He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.</line>
      <line>She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,</line>
      <line>With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.</line>
      <line>He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar –</line>
      <line>O ‘Now tread we a measure!’ said young Lochinvar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So stately his form, and so lovely her face,</line>
      <line>That never a hall such a galliard did grace –</line>
      <line>While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,</line>
      <line>And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;</line>
      <line> And the bride-maidens whispered, ‘’Twere better by far</line>
      <line>To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,</line>
      <line>When they reached the hall-door, and the charger stood near;</line>
      <line>So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,</line>
      <line>O So light to the saddle before her he sprung!</line>
      <line>‘She is won! We are gone, over bank, bush, and scar –</line>
      <line>They’ll have fleet steeds that follow!’ quoth young Lochinvar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;</line>
      <line>Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;</line>
      <line> There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,</line>
      <line>But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see –</line>
      <line>So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,</line>
      <line>Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh! blame not the bard, if he fly to the bowers</line>
      <line>Where Pleasure lies carelessly smiling at Fame;</line>
      <line>He was born for much more, and in happier hours</line>
      <line>His soul might have burned with a holier flame.</line>
      <line> The string that now languishes loose o’er the lyre</line>
      <line>Might have bent a proud bow to the warrior’s dart,</line>
      <line>And the lip which now breathes but the song of desire</line>
      <line>Might have poured the full tide of a patriot’s heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But alas for his country! Her pride is gone by,</line>
      <line>O And that spirit is broken which never would bend;</line>
      <line>O’er the ruin her children in secret must sigh,</line>
      <line>For ’tis treason to love her, and death to defend!</line>
      <line>Unprized are her sons, till they’ve learned to betray;</line>
      <line>Undistinguished they live, if they shame not their sires;</line>
      <line> And the torch that would light them through dignity’s way</line>
      <line>Must be caught from the pile where their country expires.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then blame not the bard, if in passion’s soft dream</line>
      <line>He should try to forget what he never can heal:</line>
      <line>Oh, give but a hope – let a vista but gleam</line>
      <line>O Through the gloom of his country – and mark how he’ll feel!</line>
      <line>That instant his heart at her shrine would lay down</line>
      <line>Every passion it nursed, every bliss it adored;</line>
      <line>While the myrtle, now idly entwined with his crown,</line>
      <line>Like the wreath of Harmodius, should cover his sword.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But though glory be gone, and though hope fade away,</line>
      <line>Thy name, loved Erin, shall live in his songs:</line>
      <line>Not e’en in the hour when his heart is most gay</line>
      <line>Will he lose the remembrance of thee and thy wrongs!</line>
      <line>The stranger shall hear thy lament on his plains;</line>
      <line>O The sigh of thy harp shall be sent o’er the deep –</line>
      <line>Till thy masters themselves, as they rivet thy chains,</line>
      <line>Shall pause at the song of thy captive and weep.</line>

      <line>The very knowledge that he lived in vain,</line>

      <line>Nor column trophied for triumphal show?</line>
      <line>None. But the moral’s truth tells simpler so –</line>
      <line>O As the ground was before, thus let it be!</line>
      <line>How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!</line>
      <line>And is this all the world has gained by thee,</line>
      <line>Thou first and last of fields – king-making victory?</line>

      <line> The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!</line>
      <line>How in an hour the power which gave annuls</line>
      <line>Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!</line>
      <line>In ‘pride of place’ here last the Eagle flew,</line>
      <line>Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>There was a sound of revelry by night,</line>

      <line>Her beauty and her chivalry – and bright</line>
      <line>The lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men.</line>
      <line> A thousand hearts beat happily, and when</line>
      <line>Music arose with its voluptuous swell,</line>
      <line>Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,</line>
      <line>And all went merry as a marriage-bell –</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O Did ye not hear it? No – ’twas but the wind,</line>

      <line>On with the dance! Let joy be unconfined!</line>
      <line>No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet</line>
      <line>To chase the glowing hours with flying feet –</line>
      <line> But hark! that heavy sound breaks in once more</line>
      <line>As if the clouds its echo would repeat,</line>
      <line>And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before.</line>
      <line>Arm! Arm! It is, it is, the cannon’s opening roar!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Within a windowed niche of that high hall</line>
      <line>OO Sat Brunswick’s fated Chieftain; he did hear</line>
      <line>That sound the first amidst the festival,</line>
      <line>And caught its tone with death’s prophetic ear –</line>
      <line>And when they smiled because he deemed it near,</line>
      <line>His heart more truly knew that peal too well</line>
      <line>O Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,</line>
      <line>And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:</line>
      <line>He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,</line>

      <line>Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness –</line>
      <line>And there were sudden partings, such as press</line>
      <line>The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs</line>
      <line>Which ne’er might be repeated. Who could guess</line>

      <line>And there was mounting in hot haste! The steed,</line>
      <line>The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,</line>

      <line>O And swiftly forming in the ranks of war –</line>
      <line>And the deep thunder, peal on peal, afar;</line>
      <line>And near, the beat of the alarming drum</line>
      <line>Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;</line>
      <line>While thronged the citizens, with terror dumb,</line>
      <line> Or whispering, with white lips: ‘The foe! They come! they come!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And wild and high the Cameron’s Gathering rose –</line>
      <line>The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn’s hills</line>
      <line>Have heard, and heard too have her Saxon foes.</line>
      <line>How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,</line>
      <line>O Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills</line>
      <line>Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers</line>
      <line>With the fierce native daring which instils</line>
      <line>The stirring memory of a thousand years –</line>

      <line>The morn the marshalling in arms – the day,</line>
      <line>Battle’s magnificently-stern array!</line>
      <line>The thunder-clouds close o’er it, which, when rent,</line>

      <line>Rider and horse – friend, foe – in one red burial blent!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,</line>
      <line>Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun,</line>
      <line>Conspiring with him how to load and bless</line>
      <line>With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run –</line>
      <line> To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,</line>
      <line>And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;</line>
      <line>To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel-shells</line>
      <line>With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,</line>
      <line>And still more, later flowers for the bees,</line>
      <line>O Until they think warm days will never cease,</line>
      <line>For Summer has o’erbrimmed their clammy cells.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?</line>
      <line>Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find</line>
      <line>Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,</line>
      <line> Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;</line>
      <line>Or on a half-reaped furrow, sound asleep,</line>
      <line>Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook</line>
      <line>Spares the next swath and all its twinéd flowers;</line>
      <line>And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep</line>
      <line>O Steady thy laden head across a brook,</line>
      <line>Or by a cider-press, with patient look,</line>
      <line>Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where are the songs of Spring? Aye, where are they?</line>
      <line>Think not of them, thou hast thy music too –</line>
      <line> While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,</line>
      <line>And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue.</line>
      <line>Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn</line>
      <line>Among the river sallows, borne aloft</line>
      <line>Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;</line>
      <line>O And full-grown lambs loud-bleat from hilly bourn;</line>
      <line>Hedge-crickets sing; and now, with treble soft,</line>
      <line>The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,</line>
      <line>And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.</line>

      <line>Loud is the Summer’s busy song,</line>
      <line>The smallest breeze can find a tongue,</line>
      <line>While insects of each tiny size</line>
      <line>Grow teasing with their melodies,</line>
      <line>Till noon burns with its blistering breath</line>
      <line> Around, and day dies still as death.</line>
      <line>The busy noise of man and brute</line>
      <line>Is on a sudden lost and mute;</line>
      <line>Even the brook that leaps along</line>
      <line>Seems weary of its bubbling song,</line>
      <line>And, so soft its waters creep,</line>
      <line>Tired silence sinks in sounder sleep.</line>
      <line>The cricket on its banks is dumb,</line>
      <line>The very flies forget to hum;</line>
      <line>And, save the wagon rocking round,</line>
      <line>The landscape sleeps without a sound.</line>
      <line>The breeze is stopped, the lazy bough</line>
      <line>Hath not a leaf that dances now;</line>
      <line>The tottergrass upon the hill,</line>
      <line>And spiders’ threads, are standing still;</line>
      <line>The feathers dropped from moorhen’s wing,</line>
      <line>Which to the water’s surface cling,</line>
      <line>Are steadfast, and as heavy seem</line>
      <line>As stones beneath them in the stream;</line>
      <line>Hawkweed and groundsel’s fanning downs</line>
      <line> Unruffled keep their seedy crowns;</line>
      <line>And in the oven-heated air,</line>
      <line>Not one light thing is floating there,</line>
      <line>Save that to the earnest eye</line>
      <line>The restless heat seems twittering by!</line>
      <line>Noon swoons beneath the heat it made,</line>
      <line>And flowers e’en wither in the shade,</line>
      <line>Until the sun slopes in the west,</line>
      <line>Like weary traveller, glad to rest,</line>
      <line>On pillowed clouds of many hues;</line>
      <line> Then Nature’s voice its joy renews,</line>
      <line>And chequered field and grassy plain</line>
      <line>Hum, with their summer songs again,</line>
      <line>A requiem to the day’s decline,</line>
      <line>Whose setting sunbeams coolly shine,</line>
      <line>As welcome to day’s feeble powers</line>
      <line>As falling dews to thirsty flowers.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>My beautiful, my beautiful, that standest meekly by</line>
      <line>With thy proudly arched and glossy neck, and dark and fiery eye,</line>
      <line>Fret not to roam the desert now, with all thy wingéd speed –</line>
      <line>I may not mount on thee again – thou’rt sold, my arab steed!</line>
      <line> Fret not with that impatient hoof – snuff not the breezy wind!</line>
      <line>The further that thou fliest now, so far am I behind!</line>
      <line>The stranger hath thy bridle-rein – thy master hath his gold –</line>
      <line>Fleet-limbed and beautiful, farewell! Thou’rt sold, my steed, thou’rt sold!</line>
      <line>Farewell! Those free untiréd limbs full many a mile must roam</line>
      <line>To reach the chill and wintry sky which clouds the stranger’s home;</line>
      <line>Some other hand, less fond, must now thy corn and bed prepare;</line>
      <line>The silky mane I braided once, must be another’s care!</line>
      <line>The morning sun shall dawn again, but never more with thee</line>
      <line>Shall I gallop through the desert-paths, where we were wont to be:</line>
      <line> Evening shall darken on the earth, and o’er the sandy plain</line>
      <line>Some other steed, with slower step, shall bear me home again.</line>
      <line>Yes, thou must go! The wild free breeze, the brilliant sun and sky,</line>
      <line>The master’s home – from all of these, my exiled one must fly!</line>
      <line>Thy proud dark eye will grow less proud, thy step become less fleet,</line>
      <line>And vainly shalt thou arch thy neck thy master’s hand to meet.</line>
      <line>Only in sleep shall I behold that dark eye glancing bright,</line>
      <line>Only in sleep shall hear again that step so firm and light;</line>
      <line>And when I raise my dreaming arm to check or cheer thy speed,</line>
      <line>Then must I, starting, wake, to feel – thou’rt sold, my arab steed!</line>
      <line> Ah, rudely then (unseen by me) some cruel hand may chide,</line>
      <line>Till foam-wreaths lie, like crested waves, along thy panting side;</line>
      <line>And the rich blood that is in thee swells, in thy indignant pain,</line>
      <line>Till careless eyes which rest on thee may count each started vein.</line>
      <line>Will they ill-use thee? If I thought – but no, it cannot be! –</line>
      <line>Thou art so swift, yet easy curbed; so gentle, yet so free.</line>
      <line>And yet if haply when thou’rt gone my lonely heart should yearn,</line>
      <line>Can the hand which casts thee from it now, command thee to return?</line>
      <line>Return! Alas, my arab steed, what shall thy master do</line>
      <line>When thou, who wert his all of joy, hast vanished from his view –</line>
      <line>When the dim distance cheats mine eye, and through the gathering tears</line>
      <line>Thy bright form, for a moment, like the false mirage appears?</line>
      <line>Slow and unmounted will I roam with weary foot, alone,</line>
      <line>Where with fleet step, and joyous bound, thou oft hast borne me on;</line>
      <line>And, sitting down by that green well, I’ll pause and sadly think,</line>
      <line>‘It was here he bowed his glossy neck, when last I saw him drink!’</line>
      <line>When last I saw thee drink! Away – the fevered dream is o’er! –</line>
      <line>I could not live a day, and know that we should meet no more!</line>
      <line>They tempted me, my beautiful, for hunger’s power is strong –</line>
      <line>They tempted me, my beautiful, but I have loved too long!</line>
      <line> Who said that I had given thee up? Who said that thou wert sold?</line>
      <line>’Tis false – ’tis false, my arab steed! I fling them back their gold!</line>
      <line>Thus, thus, I leap upon thy back, and scour the distant plains –</line>
      <line>Away! Who overtakes us now, shall claim thee for his pains!</line>

      <line>Abou Ben Adhem – may his tribe increase –</line>
      <line>Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,</line>
      <line>And saw, within the moonlight in his room,</line>
      <line>Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,</line>
      <line> An angel writing in a book of gold.</line>
      <line>Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,</line>
      <line>And to the presence in the room he said:</line>
      <line>‘What writest thou?’ The vision raised its head</line>
      <line>And with a look made all of sweet accord,</line>
      <line>Answered, ‘The names of those who love the Lord.’</line>
      <line>‘And is mine one?’ said Abou. ‘Nay, not so’,</line>
      <line>Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,</line>
      <line>But cheerly still, and said, ‘I pray thee, then,</line>
      <line>Write me as one who loves his fellow men.’</line>
      <line> The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night</line>
      <line>It came again, with a great wakening light,</line>
      <line>And showed the names whom love of God had blest,</line>
      <line>And lo! Ben Adhem’s name led all the rest.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Reason, vaunted sovereign of the mind –</line>
      <line>Thou pompous vision with a sounding name!</line>
      <line>Canst thou the soul’s rebellious passions tame?</line>
      <line>Canst thou in spells the vagrant fancy bind?</line>
      <line> Ah no, capricious as the wavering wind</line>
      <line>Are sighs of love that dim thy boasted flame,</line>
      <line>While Folly’s torch consumes the wreath of fame,</line>
      <line>And Pleasure’s hands the sheaves of truth unbind.</line>
      <line>Pressed by the storms of fate, hope shrinks and dies;</line>
      <line>Frenzy darts forth in mightiest ills arrayed;</line>
      <line>Around thy throne destructive tumults rise,</line>
      <line>And Hell-fraught jealousies thy rights invade!</line>
      <line>Then, what art thou, oh idol of the wise? –</line>
      <line>A visionary theme! A gorgeous shade!</line>

    <title>The Ruined Cottage</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas summer and the sun was mounted high;</line>
      <line>Along the south the uplands feebly glared</line>
      <line>Through a pale steam, and all the northern downs,</line>
      <line>In clearer air ascending, showed far off</line>
      <line> Their surfaces with shadows dappled o’er</line>
      <line>Of deep embattled clouds. Far as the sight</line>
      <line>Could reach those many shadows lay in spots</line>
      <line>Determined and unmoved, with steady beams</line>
      <line>Of clear and pleasant sunshine interposed –</line>
      <line>Pleasant to him who on the soft cool moss</line>
      <line>Extends his careless limbs beside the root</line>
      <line>Of some huge oak whose agéd branches make</line>
      <line>A twilight of their own, a dewy shade</line>
      <line>Where the wren warbles while the dreaming man,</line>
      <line> Half-conscious of that soothing melody,</line>
      <line>With sidelong eye looks out upon the scene,</line>
      <line>By those impending branches made more soft,</line>
      <line>More soft and distant.</line>
      <line>Other lot was mine.</line>
      <line>Across a bare wide common I had toiled</line>
      <line>With languid feet which by the slippery ground</line>
      <line>Were baffled still; and when I stretched myself</line>
      <line>On the brown earth my limbs from very heat</line>
      <line>Could find no rest, nor my weak arm disperse</line>
      <line>The insect host which gathered round my face</line>
      <line> And joined their murmurs to the tedious noise</line>
      <line>Of seeds of bursting gorse that crackled round.</line>
      <line>I rose and turned towards a group of trees</line>
      <line>Which midway in that level stood alone;</line>
      <line>And thither come at length, beneath a shade</line>
      <line>Of clustering elms that sprang from the same root</line>
      <line>I found a ruined house, four naked walls</line>
      <line>That stared upon each other. I looked round,</line>
      <line>And near the door I saw an agéd man</line>
      <line>Alone and stretched upon the cottage bench;</line>
      <line> An iron-pointed staff lay at his side.</line>
      <line>With instantaneous joy I recognized</line>
      <line>That pride of Nature and of lowly life,</line>
      <line>The venerable Armytage, a friend</line>
      <line>As dear to me as is the setting sun.</line>
      <line>Two days before</line>
      <line>We had been fellow-travellers. I knew</line>
      <line>That he was in this neighbourhood, and now</line>
      <line>Delighted found him here in the cool shade.</line>
      <line>He lay, his pack of rustic merchandise</line>
      <line> Pillowing his head. I guess he had no thought</line>
      <line>Of his way-wandering life. His eyes were shut,</line>
      <line>The shadows of the breezy elms above</line>
      <line>Dappled his face. With thirsty heat oppressed</line>
      <line>At length I hailed him, glad to see his hat</line>
      <line>Bedewed with water-drops, as if the brim</line>
      <line>Had newly scooped a running stream. He rose</line>
      <line>And pointing to a sun-flower, bade me climb</line>
      <line>The broken wall where that same gaudy flower</line>
      <line>Looked out upon the road.</line>
      <line>It was a plot</line>
      <line> Of garden-ground now wild, its matted weeds</line>
      <line>Marked with the steps of those whom as they passed,</line>
      <line>The gooseberry-trees that shot in long lank slips,</line>
      <line>Or currants hanging from their leafless stems</line>
      <line>In scanty strings, had tempted to o’erleap</line>
      <line>The broken wall. Within that cheerless spot,</line>
      <line>Where two tall hedgerows of thick alder boughs</line>
      <line>Joined in a damp cold nook, I found a well</line>
      <line>Half covered up with willow-flowers and grass.</line>
      <line>I slaked my thirst and to the shady bench</line>
      <line> Returned, and while I stood unbonneted</line>
      <line>To catch the motion of the cooler air</line>
      <line>The old man said, ‘I see around me here</line>
      <line>Things which you cannot see. We die, my friend,</line>
      <line>Nor we alone, but that which each man loved</line>
      <line>O And prized in his peculiar nook of earth</line>
      <line>Dies with him, or is changed, and very soon</line>
      <line>Even of the good is no memorial left.</line>
      <line>The poets, in their elegies and songs</line>
      <line>Lamenting the departed, call the groves,</line>
      <line> They call upon the hills and streams to mourn,</line>
      <line>And senseless rocks – nor idly, for they speak</line>
      <line>In these their invocations with a voice</line>
      <line>Obedient to the strong creative power</line>
      <line>Of human passion. Sympathies there are</line>
      <line>More tranquil, yet perhaps of kindred birth,</line>
      <line>That steal upon the meditative mind</line>
      <line>And grow with thought. Beside yon spring I stood,</line>
      <line>And eyed its waters till we seemed to feel</line>
      <line>One sadness, they and I. For them a bond</line>
      <line> Of brotherhood is broken: time has been</line>
      <line>When every day the touch of human hand</line>
      <line>Disturbed their stillness, and they ministered</line>
      <line>To human comfort. When I stooped to drink</line>
      <line>A spider’s web hung to the water’s edge,</line>
      <line>And on the wet and slimy foot-stone lay</line>
      <line>The useless fragment of a wooden bowl.</line>
      <line>It moved my very heart.</line>
      <line>The day has been</line>
      <line>When I could never pass this road but she</line>
      <line>Who lived within these walls, when I appeared,</line>
      <line> A daughter’s welcome gave me, and I loved her</line>
      <line>As my own child. Oh sir, the good die first,</line>
      <line>And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust</line>
      <line>Burn to the socket. Many a passenger</line>
      <line>Has blest poor Margaret for her gentle looks</line>
      <line>When she upheld the cool refreshment drawn</line>
      <line>From that forsaken spring, and no one came</line>
      <line>But he was welcome, no one went away</line>
      <line>But that it seemed she loved him. She is dead,</line>
      <line>The worm is on her cheek, and this poor hut,</line>
      <line>Stripped of its outward garb of household-flowers,</line>
      <line>Of rose and sweetbriar, offers to the wind</line>
      <line>A cold bare wall whose earthy top is tricked</line>
      <line>With weeds and the rank speargrass. She is dead,</line>
      <line>And nettles rot and adders sun themselves</line>
      <line>O Where we have sat together while she nursed</line>
      <line>Her infant at her breast. The unshod colt,</line>
      <line>The wandering heifer and the potter’s ass,</line>
      <line>Find shelter now within the chimney-wall</line>
      <line>Where I have seen her evening hearthstone blaze</line>
      <line> And through the window spread upon the road</line>
      <line>Its cheerful light. You will forgive me, sir,</line>
      <line>But often on this cottage do I muse</line>
      <line>As on a picture, till my wiser mind</line>
      <line>Sinks, yielding to the foolishness of grief.</line>
      <line>She had a husband, an industrious man,</line>
      <line>Sober and steady. I have heard her say</line>
      <line>That he was up and busy at his loom</line>
      <line>In summer ere the mower’s scythe had swept</line>
      <line>The dewy grass, and in the early spring</line>
      <line> Ere the last star had vanished. They who passed</line>
      <line>At evening, from behind the garden-fence</line>
      <line>Might hear his busy spade, which he would ply</line>
      <line>After his daily work till the daylight</line>
      <line>Was gone, and every leaf and flower were lost</line>
      <line>In the dark hedges. So they passed their days</line>
      <line>In peace and comfort, and two pretty babes</line>
      <line>Were their best hope next to the God in Heaven.</line>
      <line>You may remember, now some ten years gone,</line>
      <line>Two blighting seasons when the fields were left</line>
      <line> With half a harvest. It pleased Heaven to add</line>
      <line>A worse affliction in the plague of war;</line>
      <line>A happy land was stricken to the heart –</line>
      <line>’Twas a sad time of sorrow and distress.</line>
      <line>A wanderer among the cottages,</line>
      <line>I with my pack of winter raiment saw</line>
      <line>The hardships of that season. Many rich</line>
      <line>Sunk down as in a dream among the poor,</line>
      <line>And of the poor did many cease to be,</line>
      <line>And their place knew them not. Meanwhile, abridged</line>
      <line> Of daily comforts, gladly reconciled</line>
      <line>To numerous self-denials, Margaret</line>
      <line>Went struggling on through those calamitous years</line>
      <line>With cheerful hope. But ere the second autumn,</line>
      <line>A fever seized her husband. In disease</line>
      <line>He lingered long, and when his strength returned</line>
      <line>He found the little he had stored to meet</line>
      <line>The hour of accident, or crippling age,</line>
      <line>Was all consumed. As I have said, ’twas now</line>
      <line>A time of trouble: shoals of artisans</line>
      <line> Were from their daily labour turned away</line>
      <line>To hang for bread on parish charity,</line>
      <line>They and their wives and children – happier far</line>
      <line>Could they have lived as do the little birds</line>
      <line>That peck along the hedges, or the kite</line>
      <line>That makes her dwelling in the mountain rocks.</line>
      <line>Ill fared it now with Robert, he who dwelt</line>
      <line>In this poor cottage. At his door he stood</line>
      <line>And whistled many a snatch of merry tunes</line>
      <line>That had no mirth in them, or with his knife</line>
      <line> Carved uncouth figures on the heads of sticks;</line>
      <line>Then idly sought about through every nook</line>
      <line>Of house or garden any casual task</line>
      <line>Of use or ornament, and with a strange</line>
      <line>Amusing but uneasy novelty</line>
      <line>He blended where he might the various tasks</line>
      <line>Of summer, autumn, winter, and of spring.</line>
      <line>But this endured not, his good humour soon</line>
      <line>Became a weight in which no pleasure was,</line>
      <line>And poverty brought on a petted mood</line>
      <line> And a sore temper. Day by day he drooped,</line>
      <line>And he would leave his home, and to the town</line>
      <line>Without an errand would he turn his steps,</line>
      <line>Or wander here and there among the fields.</line>
      <line>One while he would speak lightly of his babes</line>
      <line>And with a cruel tongue, at other times</line>
      <line>He played with them wild freaks of merriment,</line>
      <line>And ’twas a piteous thing to see the looks</line>
      <line>Of the poor innocent children. ‘Every smile’,</line>
      <line>Said Margaret to me here beneath these trees,</line>
      <line>‘Made my heart bleed.’</line>
      <line> At this the old man paused,</line>
      <line>And looking up to those enormous elms</line>
      <line>He said, ‘’Tis now the hour of deepest noon.</line>
      <line>At this still season of repose and peace,</line>
      <line>This hour when all things which are not at rest</line>
      <line>Are cheerful, while this multitude of flies</line>
      <line>Fills all the air with happy melody,</line>
      <line>Why should a tear be in an old man’s eye?</line>
      <line>Why should we thus with an untoward mind,</line>
      <line>And in the weakness of humanity,</line>
      <line> From natural wisdom turn our hearts away,</line>
      <line>To natural comfort shut our eyes and ears,</line>
      <line>And, feeding on disquiet, thus disturb</line>
      <line>The calm of Nature with our restless thoughts?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He spake with somewhat of a solemn tone,</line>
      <line>But when he ended there was in his face</line>
      <line>Such easy cheerfulness, a look so mild,</line>
      <line>That for a little time it stole away</line>
      <line>All recollection, and that simple tale</line>
      <line>Passed from my mind like a forgotten sound.</line>
      <line>A while on trivial things we held discourse,</line>
      <line>To me soon tasteless. In my own despite</line>
      <line>I thought of that poor woman as of one</line>
      <line>Whom I had known and loved. He had rehearsed</line>
      <line>Her homely tale with such familiar power,</line>
      <line>With such an active countenance, an eye</line>
      <line>So busy, that the things of which he spake</line>
      <line>Seemed present, and, attention now relaxed,</line>
      <line>There was a heartfelt chillness in my veins.</line>
      <line>I rose, and turning from that breezy shade</line>
      <line> Went out into the open air, and stood</line>
      <line>To drink the comfort of the warmer sun.</line>
      <line>Long time I had not stayed ere, looking round</line>
      <line>Upon that tranquil ruin, I returned</line>
      <line>And begged of the old man that for my sake</line>
      <line>He would resume his story.</line>
      <line>He replied,</line>
      <line>‘It were a wantonness, and would demand</line>
      <line>Severe reproof, if we were men whose hearts</line>
      <line>Could hold vain dalliance with the misery</line>
      <line>Even of the dead, contented thence to draw</line>
      <line> A momentary pleasure, never marked</line>
      <line>By reason, barren of all future good.</line>
      <line>But we have known that there is often found</line>
      <line>In mournful thoughts, and always might be found,</line>
      <line>A power to virtue friendly; were’t not so</line>
      <line>I am a dreamer among men, indeed</line>
      <line>An idle dreamer. ’Tis a common tale</line>
      <line>By moving accidents uncharactered,</line>
      <line>A tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed</line>
      <line>In bodily form, and to the grosser sense</line>
      <line> But ill adapted – scarcely palpable</line>
      <line>To him who does not think. But at your bidding</line>
      <line>I will proceed.</line>
      <line>While thus it fared with them</line>
      <line>To whom this cottage till that hapless year</line>
      <line>Had been a blesséd home, it was my chance</line>
      <line>To travel in a country far remote;</line>
      <line>And glad I was when, halting by yon gate</line>
      <line>That leads from the green lane, again I saw</line>
      <line>These lofty elm-trees. Long I did not rest –</line>
      <line>With many pleasant thoughts I cheered my way</line>
      <line> O’er the flat common. At the door arrived,</line>
      <line>I knocked, and when I entered, with the hope</line>
      <line>Of usual greeting, Margaret looked at me</line>
      <line>A little while, then turned her head away</line>
      <line>Speechless, and sitting down upon a chair</line>
      <line>Wept bitterly. I wist not what to do,</line>
      <line>Or how to speak to her. Poor wretch, at last</line>
      <line>She rose from off her seat, and then, oh sir,</line>
      <line>I cannot tell how she pronounced my name.</line>
      <line>With fervent love, and with a face of grief</line>
      <line> Unutterably helpless, and a look</line>
      <line>That seemed to cling upon me, she enquired</line>
      <line>If I had seen her husband. As she spake</line>
      <line>A strange surprise and fear came to my heart,</line>
      <line>Nor had I power to answer ere she told</line>
      <line>That he had disappeared – just two months gone,</line>
      <line>He left his house. Two wretched days had passed,</line>
      <line>And on the third by the first break of light,</line>
      <line>Within her casement full in view she saw</line>
      <line>A purse of gold. “I trembled at the sight”,</line>
      <line> Said Margaret, “for I knew it was his hand</line>
      <line>That placed it there. And on that very day</line>
      <line>By one, a stranger, from my husband sent,</line>
      <line>The tidings came that he had joined a troop</line>
      <line>Of soldiers going to a distant land.</line>
      <line>He left me thus. Poor man, he had not heart</line>
      <line>To take a farewell of me, and he feared</line>
      <line>That I should follow with my babes, and sink</line>
      <line>Beneath the misery of a soldier’s life.”</line>
      <line>This tale did Margaret tell with many tears,</line>
      <line> And when she ended I had little power</line>
      <line>To give her comfort, and was glad to take</line>
      <line>Such words of hope from her own mouth as served</line>
      <line>To cheer us both. But long we had not talked</line>
      <line>Ere we built up a pile of better thoughts,</line>
      <line>And with a brighter eye she looked around</line>
      <line>As if she had been shedding tears of joy.</line>
      <line>We parted. It was then the early spring;</line>
      <line>I left her busy with her garden-tools,</line>
      <line>And well remember, o’er that fence she looked,</line>
      <line> And, while I paced along the foot-way path,</line>
      <line>Called out and sent a blessing after me,</line>
      <line>With tender cheerfulness, and with a voice</line>
      <line>That seemed the very sound of happy thoughts.</line>
      <line>I roved o’er many a hill and many a dale</line>
      <line>With this my weary load, in heat and cold,</line>
      <line>Through many a wood and many an open ground,</line>
      <line>In sunshine or in shade, in wet or fair,</line>
      <line>Now blithe, now drooping, as it might befall;</line>
      <line>My best companions now the driving winds</line>
      <line> And now the “trotting brooks” and whispering trees,</line>
      <line>And now the music of my own sad steps,</line>
      <line>With many a short-lived thought that passed between</line>
      <line>And disappeared.</line>
      <line>I came this way again</line>
      <line>Towards the wane of summer, when the wheat</line>
      <line>Was yellow, and the soft and bladed grass</line>
      <line>Sprang up afresh and o’er the hayfield spread</line>
      <line>Its tender green. When I had reached the door</line>
      <line>I found that she was absent. In the shade,</line>
      <line>Where we now sit, I waited her return.</line>
      <line>Her cottage in its outward look appeared</line>
      <line>As cheerful as before, in any show</line>
      <line>Of neatness little changed – but that I thought</line>
      <line>The honeysuckle crowded round the door</line>
      <line>And from the wall hung down in heavier tufts,</line>
      <line>And knots of worthless stonecrop started out</line>
      <line>Along the window’s edge, and grew like weeds</line>
      <line>Against the lower panes. I turned aside</line>
      <line>And strolled into her garden. It was changed.</line>
      <line>The unprofitable bindweed spread his bells</line>
      <line> From side to side, and with unwieldy wreathes</line>
      <line>Had dragged the rose from its sustaining wall</line>
      <line>And bent it down to earth. The border tufts,</line>
      <line>Daisy, and thrift, and lowly camomile,</line>
      <line>And thyme, had straggled out into the paths</line>
      <line>Which they were used to deck.</line>
      <line>Ere this an hour</line>
      <line>Was wasted. Back I turned my restless steps,</line>
      <line>And as I walked before the door it chanced</line>
      <line>A stranger passed, and guessing whom I sought,</line>
      <line>He said that she was used to ramble far.</line>
      <line> The sun was sinking in the west, and now</line>
      <line>I sat with sad impatience. From within</line>
      <line>Her solitary infant cried aloud.</line>
      <line>The spot though fair seemed very desolate –</line>
      <line>The longer I remained more desolate –</line>
      <line>And looking round I saw the corner-stones,</line>
      <line>Till then unmarked, on either side the door</line>
      <line>With dull red stains discoloured, and stuck o’er</line>
      <line>With tufts and hairs of wool, as if the sheep</line>
      <line>That feed upon the commons thither came</line>
      <line> Familiarly, and found a couching-place</line>
      <line>Even at her threshold.</line>
      <line>The house-clock struck eight:</line>
      <line>I turned and saw her distant a few steps.</line>
      <line>Her face was pale and thin, her figure too</line>
      <line>Was changed. As she unlocked the door she said,</line>
      <line>“It grieves me you have waited here so long,</line>
      <line>But in good truth I’ve wandered much of late,</line>
      <line>And sometimes – to my shame I speak – have need</line>
      <line>Of my best prayers to bring me back again.”</line>
      <line>While on the board she spread our evening meal</line>
      <line> She told me she had lost her elder child,</line>
      <line>That he for months had been a serving-boy,</line>
      <line>Apprenticed by the parish. “I perceive</line>
      <line>You look at me, and you have cause. Today</line>
      <line>I have been travelling far, and many days</line>
      <line>About the fields I wander, knowing this</line>
      <line>Only, that what I seek I cannot find.</line>
      <line>And so I waste my time: for I am changed,</line>
      <line>And to myself”, said she, “have done much wrong,</line>
      <line>And to this helpless infant. I have slept</line>
      <line> Weeping, and weeping I have waked. My tears</line>
      <line>Have flowed as if my body were not such</line>
      <line>As others are, and I could never die.</line>
      <line>But I am now in mind and in my heart</line>
      <line>More easy, and I hope”, said she, “that Heaven</line>
      <line>Will give me patience to endure the things</line>
      <line>Which I behold at home.”</line>
      <line>It would have grieved</line>
      <line>Your very soul to see her. Sir, I feel</line>
      <line>The story linger in my heart. I fear</line>
      <line>’Tis long and tedious, but my spirit clings</line>
      <line> To that poor woman. So familiarly</line>
      <line>Do I perceive her manner and her look</line>
      <line>And presence, and so deeply do I feel</line>
      <line>Her goodness, that not seldom in my walks</line>
      <line>A momentary trance comes over me</line>
      <line>And to myself I seem to muse on one</line>
      <line>By sorrow laid asleep or borne away,</line>
      <line>A human being destined to awake</line>
      <line>To human life, or something very near</line>
      <line>To human life, when he shall come again</line>
      <line> For whom she suffered. Sir, it would have grieved</line>
      <line>Your very soul to see her: evermore</line>
      <line>Her eyelids drooped, her eyes were downward cast,</line>
      <line>And when she at her table gave me food</line>
      <line>She did not look at me. Her voice was low,</line>
      <line>Her body was subdued. In every act</line>
      <line>Pertaining to her house-affairs appeared</line>
      <line>The careless stillness which a thinking mind</line>
      <line>Gives to an idle matter. Still she sighed,</line>
      <line>But yet no motion of the breast was seen,</line>
      <line> No heaving of the heart. While by the fire</line>
      <line>We sat together, sighs came on my ear –</line>
      <line>I knew not how, and hardly whence, they came.</line>
      <line>I took my staff, and when I kissed her babe</line>
      <line>The tears stood in her eyes. I left her then</line>
      <line>With the best hope and comfort I could give:</line>
      <line>She thanked me for my will, but for my hope</line>
      <line>It seemed she did not thank me.</line>
      <line>I returned</line>
      <line>And took my rounds along this road again</line>
      <line>Ere on its sunny bank the primrose flower</line>
      <line> Had chronicled the earliest day of spring.</line>
      <line>I found her sad and drooping. She had learned</line>
      <line>No tidings of her husband. If he lived,</line>
      <line>She knew not that he lived: if he were dead,</line>
      <line>She knew not he was dead. She seemed the same</line>
      <line>In person or appearance, but her house</line>
      <line>Bespoke a sleepy hand of negligence.</line>
      <line>The floor was neither dry nor neat, the hearth</line>
      <line>Was comfortless,</line>
      <line>The windows too were dim, and her few books,</line>
      <line>Which one upon the other heretofore</line>
      <line>Had been piled up against the corner-panes</line>
      <line>In seemly order, now with straggling leaves</line>
      <line>Lay scattered here and there, open or shut,</line>
      <line>As they had chanced to fall. Her infant babe</line>
      <line>Had from its mother caught the trick of grief,</line>
      <line>And sighed among its playthings. Once again</line>
      <line>I turned towards the garden-gate, and saw</line>
      <line>More plainly still that poverty and grief</line>
      <line>Were now come nearer to her. The earth was hard,</line>
      <line> With weeds defaced and knots of withered grass;</line>
      <line>No ridges there appeared of clear black mould,</line>
      <line>No winter greenness. Of her herbs and flowers</line>
      <line>It seemed the better part were gnawed away</line>
      <line>Or trampled on the earth. A chain of straw,</line>
      <line>Which had been twisted round the tender stem</line>
      <line>Of a young apple-tree, lay at its root;</line>
      <line>The bark was nibbled round by truant sheep.</line>
      <line>Margaret stood near, her infant in her arms,</line>
      <line>And, seeing that my eye was on the tree,</line>
      <line> She said, “I fear it will be dead and gone</line>
      <line>Ere Robert come again.”</line>
      <line>Towards the house</line>
      <line>Together we returned, and she enquired</line>
      <line>If I had any hope. But for her babe,</line>
      <line>And for her little friendless boy, she said,</line>
      <line>She had no wish to live – that she must die</line>
      <line>Of sorrow. Yet I saw the idle loom</line>
      <line>Still in its place. His Sunday garments hung</line>
      <line>Upon the self-same nail, his very staff</line>
      <line>Stood undisturbed behind the door. And when</line>
      <line> I passed this way beaten by autumn winds,</line>
      <line>She told me that her little babe was dead</line>
      <line>And she was left alone. That very time,</line>
      <line>I yet remember, through the miry lane</line>
      <line>She walked with me a mile, when the bare trees</line>
      <line>Trickled with foggy damps, and in such sort</line>
      <line>That any heart had ached to hear her, begged</line>
      <line>That wheresoe’er I went I still would ask</line>
      <line>For him whom she had lost. We parted then,</line>
      <line>Our final parting; for from that time forth</line>
      <line> Did many seasons pass ere I returned</line>
      <line>Into this tract again.</line>
      <line>Five tedious years</line>
      <line>She lingered in unquiet widowhood,</line>
      <line>A wife and widow. Needs must it have been</line>
      <line>A sore heart-wasting. I have heard, my friend,</line>
      <line>That in that broken arbour she would sit</line>
      <line>The idle length of half a sabbath-day –</line>
      <line>There, where you see the toadstool’s lazy head –</line>
      <line>And when a dog passed by she still would quit</line>
      <line>The shade and look abroad. On this old bench</line>
      <line> For hours she sat, and evermore her eye</line>
      <line>Was busy in the distance, shaping things</line>
      <line>Which made her heart beat quick. Seest thou that path?</line>
      <line>The green-sward now has broken its grey line –</line>
      <line>There to and fro she paced through many a day</line>
      <line>Of the warm summer, from a belt of flax</line>
      <line>That girt her waist, spinning the long-drawn thread</line>
      <line>With backward steps. Yet ever as there passed</line>
      <line>A man whose garments showed the soldier’s red,</line>
      <line>Or crippled mendicant in sailor’s garb,</line>
      <line> The little child who sat to turn the wheel</line>
      <line>Ceased from his toil, and she, with faltering voice,</line>
      <line>Expecting still to learn her husband’s fate,</line>
      <line>Made many a fond enquiry; and when they</line>
      <line>Whose presence gave no comfort, were gone by,</line>
      <line>Her heart was still more sad. And by yon gate,</line>
      <line>Which bars the traveller’s road, she often stood</line>
      <line>And, when a stranger horseman came, the latch</line>
      <line>Would lift, and in his face look wistfully,</line>
      <line>Most happy if from aught discovered there</line>
      <line> Of tender feeling she might dare repeat</line>
      <line>The same sad question.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile her poor hut</line>
      <line>Sunk to decay; for he was gone, whose hand</line>
      <line>At the first nippings of October frost</line>
      <line>Closed up each chink, and with fresh bands of straw</line>
      <line>Chequered the green-grown thatch. And so she lived</line>
      <line>Through the long winter, reckless and alone,</line>
      <line>Till this reft house, by frost, and thaw, and rain,</line>
      <line>Was sapped; and when she slept, the nightly damps</line>
      <line>Did chill her breast, and in the stormy day</line>
      <line> Her tattered clothes were ruffled by the wind</line>
      <line>Even at the side of her own fire. Yet still</line>
      <line>She loved this wretched spot, nor would for worlds</line>
      <line>Have parted hence; and still that length of road,</line>
      <line>And this rude bench, one torturing hope endeared,</line>
      <line>Fast rooted at her heart. And here, my friend,</line>
      <line>In sickness she remained; and here she died,</line>
      <line>Last human tenant of these ruined walls.’</line>
      <line>The old man ceased; he saw that I was moved.</line>
      <line>From that low bench rising instinctively</line>
      <line> I turned aside in weakness, nor had power</line>
      <line>To thank him for the tale which he had told.</line>
      <line>I stood, and leaning o’er the garden gate</line>
      <line>Reviewed that woman’s sufferings; and it seemed</line>
      <line>To comfort me while with a brother’s love</line>
      <line>I blest her in the impotence of grief.</line>
      <line>At length towards the cottage I returned</line>
      <line>Fondly, and traced with milder interest</line>
      <line>That secret spirit of humanity</line>
      <line>Which, mid the calm oblivious tendencies</line>
      <line>Of Nature, mid her plants, her weeds and flowers,</line>
      <line>And silent overgrowings, still survived.</line>
      <line>The old man seeing this resumed, and said,</line>
      <line>‘My friend, enough to sorrow have you given,</line>
      <line>The purposes of wisdom ask no more:</line>
      <line>Be wise and cheerful, and no longer read</line>
      <line>The forms of things with an unworthy eye.</line>
      <line>She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here.</line>
      <line>I well remember that those very plumes</line>
      <line>Those weeds, and the high spear-grass on that wall,</line>
      <line> By mist and silent raindrops silvered o’er,</line>
      <line>As once I passed did to my mind convey</line>
      <line>So still an image of tranquillity,</line>
      <line>So calm and still, and looked so beautiful</line>
      <line>Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind,</line>
      <line>That what we feel of sorrow and despair</line>
      <line>From ruin and from change, and all the grief</line>
      <line>The passing shows of being leave behind,</line>
      <line>Appeared an idle dream that could not live</line>
      <line>Where meditation was. I turned away,</line>
      <line> And walked along my road in happiness.’</line>
      <line>He ceased. By this the sun declining shot</line>
      <line>A slant and mellow radiance, which began</line>
      <line>To fall upon us where beneath the trees</line>
      <line>We sat on that low bench. And now we felt,</line>
      <line>Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on:</line>
      <line>A linnet warbled from those lofty elms,</line>
      <line>A thrush sang loud, and other melodies</line>
      <line>At distance heard peopled the milder air.</line>
      <line>The old man rose and hoisted up his load;</line>
      <line> Together casting then a farewell look</line>
      <line>Upon those silent walls, we left the shade,</line>
      <line>And ere the stars were visible attained</line>
      <line>A rustic inn, our evening resting-place.</line>

    <title>Love</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>All thoughts, all passions, all delights,</line>
      <line>Whatever stirs this mortal frame,</line>
      <line>All are but ministers of Love,</line>
      <line>And feed his sacred flame.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Oft in my waking dreams do I</line>
      <line>Live o’er again that happy hour,</line>
      <line>When midway on the mount I lay</line>
      <line>Beside the ruined tower.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The moonshine, stealing o’er the scene,</line>
      <line>Had blended with the lights of eve,</line>
      <line>And she was there, my hope, my joy,</line>
      <line>My own dear Genevieve!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She leant against the arméd man,</line>
      <line>The statue of the arméd knight –</line>
      <line> She stood and listened to my lay,</line>
      <line>Amid the lingering light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Few sorrows hath she of her own,</line>
      <line>My hope! my joy! my Genevieve!</line>
      <line>She loves me best whene’er I sing</line>
      <line>The songs that make her grieve.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I played a soft and doleful air,</line>
      <line>I sang an old and moving story –</line>
      <line>An old rude song, that suited well</line>
      <line>That ruin wild and hoary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> She listened with a flitting blush,</line>
      <line>With downcast eyes and modest grace,</line>
      <line>For well she knew I could not choose</line>
      <line>But gaze upon her face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I told her of the Knight that wore</line>
      <line>Upon his shield a burning brand,</line>
      <line>And that for ten long years he wooed</line>
      <line>The Lady of the Land.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I told her how he pined – and ah!</line>
      <line>The deep, the low, the pleading tone</line>
      <line> With which I sang another’s love,</line>
      <line>Interpreted my own.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She listened with a flitting blush,</line>
      <line>With downcast eyes, and modest grace,</line>
      <line>And she forgave me that I gazed</line>
      <line>Too fondly on her face!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when I told the cruel scorn</line>
      <line>That crazed that bold and lovely Knight,</line>
      <line>And that he crossed the mountain-woods,</line>
      <line>Nor rested day nor night;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> That sometimes from the savage den,</line>
      <line>And sometimes from the darksome shade,</line>
      <line>And sometimes starting up at once</line>
      <line>In green and sunny glade,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There came and looked him in the face</line>
      <line>An angel beautiful and bright;</line>
      <line>And that he knew it was a fiend,</line>
      <line>This miserable Knight!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And that unknowing what he did,</line>
      <line>He leaped amid a murderous band,</line>
      <line> And saved from outrage worse than death</line>
      <line>The Lady of the Land!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And how she wept, and clasped his knees;</line>
      <line>And how she tended him in vain,</line>
      <line>And ever strove to expiate</line>
      <line>The scorn that crazed his brain –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And that she nursed him in a cave,</line>
      <line>And how his madness went away</line>
      <line>When on the yellow forest-leaves</line>
      <line>A dying man he lay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> His dying words – but when I reached</line>
      <line>That tenderest strain of all the ditty,</line>
      <line>My faltering voice and pausing harp</line>
      <line>Disturbed her soul with pity!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All impulses of soul and sense</line>
      <line>Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve –</line>
      <line>The music and the doleful tale,</line>
      <line>The rich and balmy eve –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And hopes, and fears that kindle hope,</line>
      <line>An undistinguishable throng,</line>
      <line> And gentle wishes long subdued,</line>
      <line>Subdued and cherished long!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She wept with pity and delight,</line>
      <line>She blushed with love and virgin-shame,</line>
      <line>And like the murmur of a dream</line>
      <line>I heard her breathe my name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her bosom heaved, she stepped aside –</line>
      <line>As conscious of my look she stepped –</line>
      <line>Then suddenly, with timorous eye,</line>
      <line>She fled to me and wept.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> She half enclosed me with her arms,</line>
      <line>She pressed me with a meek embrace,</line>
      <line>And, bending back her head, looked up</line>
      <line>And gazed upon my face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas partly love, and partly fear,</line>
      <line>And partly ’twas a bashful art,</line>
      <line>That I might rather feel, than see,</line>
      <line>The swelling of her heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I calmed her fears, and she was calm,</line>
      <line>And told her love with virgin pride –</line>
      <line> And so I won my Genevieve,</line>
      <line>My bright and beauteous bride.</line>

    <title>The Crystal Cabinet</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The maiden caught me in the wild</line>
      <line>Where I was dancing merrily;</line>
      <line>She put me into her cabinet</line>
      <line>And locked me up with a golden key.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> This cabinet is formed of gold</line>
      <line>And pearl and crystal shining bright,</line>
      <line>And within it opens into a world</line>
      <line>And a little lovely moony night!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Another England there I saw,</line>
      <line>Another London with its Tower,</line>
      <line>Another Thames and other hills,</line>
      <line>And another pleasant Surrey bower,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Another maiden like herself,</line>
      <line>Translucent, lovely, shining clear,</line>
      <line> Threefold each in the other closed –</line>
      <line>Oh what a pleasant trembling fear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh what a smile, a threefold-smile,</line>
      <line>Filled me, that like a flame I burned!</line>
      <line>I bent to kiss the lovely maid,</line>
      <line>And found a threefold-kiss returned;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I strove to seize the inmost form</line>
      <line>With ardour fierce and hands of flame,</line>
      <line>But burst the crystal cabinet</line>
      <line>And like a weeping babe became!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A weeping babe upon the wild</line>
      <line>And weeping woman pale reclined –</line>
      <line>And in the outward air again</line>
      <line>I filled with woes the passing wind!</line>

    <title>The Mental Traveller</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I travelled through a land of men,</line>
      <line>A land of men, and women too –</line>
      <line>And heard and saw such dreadful things</line>
      <line>As cold-earth wanderers never knew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> For there the babe is born in joy</line>
      <line>That was begotten in dire woe,</line>
      <line>Just as we reap in joy the fruit</line>
      <line>Which we in bitter tears did sow;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if the babe is born a boy,</line>
      <line>He’s given to a woman old</line>
      <line>Who nails him down upon a rock,</line>
      <line>Catches his shrieks in cups of gold –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She binds iron thorns around his head,</line>
      <line>She pierces both his hands and feet,</line>
      <line> She cuts his heart out at his side</line>
      <line>To make it feel both cold and heat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her fingers number every nerve</line>
      <line>Just as a miser counts his gold,</line>
      <line>She lives upon his shrieks and cries</line>
      <line>And she grows young as he grows old;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till he becomes a bleeding youth</line>
      <line>And she becomes a virgin bright,</line>
      <line>Then he rends up his manacles</line>
      <line>And binds her down for his delight –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He plants himself in all her nerves</line>
      <line>Just as a husbandman his mould,</line>
      <line>And she becomes his dwelling place</line>
      <line>And garden fruitful seventy-fold!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>An agéd shadow soon he fades</line>
      <line>Wandering round an earthly cot,</line>
      <line>Full filled all with gems and gold</line>
      <line>Which he by industry had got –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And these are the gems of the human soul:</line>
      <line>The rubies and pearls of a lovesick eye,</line>
      <line> The countless gold of the aching heart,</line>
      <line>The martyr’s groan and the lover’s sigh.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They are his meat, they are his drink;</line>
      <line>He feeds the beggar and the poor</line>
      <line>And the wayfaring traveller –</line>
      <line>For ever open is his door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His grief is their eternal joy:</line>
      <line>They make the roofs and walls to ring,</line>
      <line>Till from the fire on the hearth</line>
      <line>A little female babe does spring!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And she is all of solid fire</line>
      <line>And gems and gold, that none his hand</line>
      <line>Dares stretch to touch her baby form,</line>
      <line>Or wrap her in his swaddling-band.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But she comes to the man she loves,</line>
      <line>If young or old or rich or poor,</line>
      <line>They soon drive out the agéd host,</line>
      <line>A beggar at another’s door –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He wanders weeping far away</line>
      <line>Until some other take him in,</line>
      <line> Oft blind and age-bent, sore distressed,</line>
      <line>Until he can a maiden win;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And to allay his freezing age</line>
      <line>The poor man takes her in his arms –</line>
      <line>The cottage fades before his sight,</line>
      <line>The garden and its lovely charms!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The guests are scattered through the land,</line>
      <line>For the eye, altering, alters all!</line>
      <line>The senses roll themselves in fear</line>
      <line>And the flat earth becomes a ball;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The stars, sun, moon all shrink away,</line>
      <line>A desert vast without a bound,</line>
      <line>And nothing left to eat or drink</line>
      <line>And a dark desert all around.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The honey of her infant lips,</line>
      <line>The bread and wine of her sweet smile,</line>
      <line>The wild game of her roving eye,</line>
      <line>Does him to infancy beguile –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For as he eats and drinks he grows</line>
      <line>Younger and younger every day,</line>
      <line> And on the desert wild they both</line>
      <line>Wander in terror and dismay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Like the wild stag she flees away</line>
      <line>(Her fear plants many a thicket wild)</line>
      <line>While he pursues her night and day</line>
      <line>By various arts of love beguiled –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By various arts of love and hate;</line>
      <line>Till the wide desert planted o’er</line>
      <line>With labyrinths of wayward love</line>
      <line>Where roams the lion, wolf, and boar;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Till he becomes a wayward babe</line>
      <line>And she a weeping woman old!</line>
      <line>Then many a lover wanders here</line>
      <line>The sun and stars are nearer rolled,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The trees bring forth sweet ecstasy</line>
      <line>To all who in the desert roam,</line>
      <line>Till many a city there is built</line>
      <line>And many a pleasant shepherd’s home.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when they find the frowning babe</line>
      <line>Terror strikes through the region wide,</line>
      <line> They cry, ‘The babe, the babe is born!’</line>
      <line>And flee away on every side –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For who dare touch the frowning form</line>
      <line>His arm is withered to its root;</line>
      <line>Lions, boars, wolves, all howling flee,</line>
      <line>OAnd every tree does shed its fruit.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And none can touch that frowning form,</line>
      <line>Except it be a woman old –</line>
      <line>She nails him down upon the rock,</line>
      <line>And all is done as I have told.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Mid the blue waves, by circling seas embraced,</line>
      <line>A chosen spot of fairest land was seen,</line>
      <line>For there with favouring hand had Nature placed</line>
      <line>All that could lovely make the varied scene:</line>
      <line>Eternal Spring there spread her mantle green;</line>
      <line>There high surrounding hills deep-wooded rose</line>
      <line>O’er placid lakes; while marble rocks between</line>
      <line>The fragrant shrubs their pointed heads disclose,</line>
      <line>And balmy breathes each gale which o’er the island blows.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Pleasure had called the fertile lawns her own,</line>
      <line>And thickly strewed them with her choicest flowers;</line>
      <line>Amid the quiet glade her golden throne</line>
      <line>Bright shone with lustre through o’erarching bowers:</line>
      <line>There her fair train, the ever-downy Hours</line>
      <line>Sport on light wing with the young Joys entwined;</line>
      <line>While Hope, delighted, from her full lap showers</line>
      <line>Blossoms, whose fragrance can the ravished mind</line>
      <line>Inebriate with dreams of rapture unconfined.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And in the grassy centre of the isle,</line>
      <line> Where the thick verdure spreads a damper shade,</line>
      <line>Amid their native rocks concealed awhile,</line>
      <line>Then o’er the plains in devious streams displayed,</line>
      <line>Two gushing fountains rise; and thence conveyed,</line>
      <line>Their waters through the woods and valleys play,</line>
      <line>Visit each green recess and secret glade,</line>
      <line>With still unmingled, still meandering way,</line>
      <line>Nor widely wandering far, can each from other stray.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But of strange contrast are their virtues found,</line>
      <line>And oft the lady of that isle has tried</line>
      <line> In rocky dens and caverns under ground,</line>
      <line>The black deforméd stream in vain to hide –</line>
      <line>Bursting all bounds her labours it defied!</line>
      <line>Yet many a flowery sod its course conceals</line>
      <line>Through plains where deep its silent waters glide,</line>
      <line>Till secret ruin, all corroding, steals,</line>
      <line>And every treacherous arch the hideous gulf reveals.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Forbidding every kindly prosperous growth,</line>
      <line>Where’er it ran, a channel bleak it wore;</line>
      <line>The gaping banks receded, as though loth</line>
      <line> To touch the poison which disgraced their shore:</line>
      <line>There deadly anguish pours unmixed his store</line>
      <line>Of all the ills which sting the human breast,</line>
      <line>The hopeless tears which past delights deplore,</line>
      <line>Heart-gnawing jealousy which knows no rest,</line>
      <line>And self-upbraiding shame, by stern remorse opprest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, how unlike the pure transparent stream</line>
      <line>Which near it bubbles o’er its golden sands!</line>
      <line>The impeding stones with pleasant music seem</line>
      <line>Its progress to detain from other lands;</line>
      <line> And all its banks, enwreathed with flowery bands,</line>
      <line>Ambrosial fragrance shed in grateful dew.</line>
      <line>There young Desire enchanted ever stands,</line>
      <line>Breathing delight and fragrance ever new,</line>
      <line>And bathed in constant joys of fond affection true.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But not to mortals is it e’er allowed</line>
      <line>To drink unmingled of that current bright.</line>
      <line>Scarce can they taste the pleasurable flood,</line>
      <line>Defiled by angry Fortune’s envious spite,</line>
      <line>Who from the cup of amorous delight</line>
      <line> Dashes the sparkling draught of brilliant joy,</line>
      <line>Till, with dull sorrow’s stream despoiléd quite,</line>
      <line>No more it cheers the soul nor charms the eye,</line>
      <line>But mid the poisoned bowl distrust and anguish lie.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here Cupid tempers his unerring darts,</line>
      <line>And in the fount of bliss delights to play;</line>
      <line>Here mingles balmy sighs and pleasing smarts,</line>
      <line>And here the honied draught will oft allay</line>
      <line>With that black poison’s all-polluting sway,</line>
      <line>For wretched man. Hither, as Venus willed,</line>
      <line>For Psyche’s punishment he bent his way;</line>
      <line>From either stream his amber vase he filled –</line>
      <line>For her were meant the drops which grief alone distilled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His quiver, sparkling bright with gems and gold,</line>
      <line>From his fair pluméd shoulder graceful hung,</line>
      <line>And from its top in brilliant chords enrolled,</line>
      <line>Each little vase resplendently was slung.</line>
      <line>Still as he flew, around him sportive clung</line>
      <line>His frolic train of wingéd zephyrs light,</line>
      <line>Wafting the fragrance which his tresses flung;</line>
      <line> While odours dropped from every ringlet bright,</line>
      <line>And from his blue eyes beamed ineffable delight.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wrapt in a cloud unseen by mortal eye,</line>
      <line>He sought the chamber of the royal maid;</line>
      <line>There, lulled by careless soft security,</line>
      <line>Of the impending mischief nought afraid,</line>
      <line>Upon her purple couch was Psyche laid,</line>
      <line>Her radiant eyes a downy slumber sealed;</line>
      <line>In light transparent veil alone arrayed,</line>
      <line>Her bosom’s opening charms were half revealed,</line>
      <line> And scarce the lucid folds her polished limbs concealed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A placid smile plays o’er each roseate lip!</line>
      <line>Sweet severed lips, while thus your pearls disclose</line>
      <line>That slumbering thus unconscious she may sip</line>
      <line>The cruel presage of her future woes.</line>
      <line>Lightly, as fall the dews upon the rose,</line>
      <line>Upon the coral gates of that sweet cell</line>
      <line>The fatal drops he pours; nor yet he knows</line>
      <line>(Nor, though a god, can he presaging tell)</line>
      <line>How he himself shall mourn the ills of that sad spell!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Nor yet content, he from his quiver drew,</line>
      <line>Sharpened with skill divine, a shining dart.</line>
      <line>No need had he for bow, since thus too true</line>
      <line>His hand might wound her all-exposéd heart,</line>
      <line>Yet her fair side he touched with gentlest art,</line>
      <line>And half relenting on her beauties gazed!</line>
      <line>Just then, awaking with a sudden start,</line>
      <line>Her opening eye in humid lustre blazed –</line>
      <line>Unseen he still remained, enchanted and amazed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The dart which in his hand now trembling stood,</line>
      <line> As o’er the couch he bent with ravished eye,</line>
      <line>Drew with its daring point celestial blood</line>
      <line>From his smooth neck’s unblemished ivory.</line>
      <line>Heedless of this, but with a pitying sigh</line>
      <line>(The evil done now anxious to repair),</line>
      <line>He shed in haste the balmy drops of joy</line>
      <line>O’er all the silky ringlets of her hair;</line>
      <line>Then stretched his plumes divine, and breathed celestial air.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Unhappy Psyche! Soon the latent wound</line>
      <line>The fading roses of her cheek confess,</line>
      <line> Her eyes’ bright beams, in swimming sorrows drowned,</line>
      <line>Sparkle no more with life and happiness</line>
      <line>Her parents’ fond exulting heart to bless.</line>
      <line>She shuns adoring crowds, and seeks to hide</line>
      <line>The pining sorrows which her soul oppress,</line>
      <line>Till to her mother’s tears no more denied,</line>
      <line>The secret grief she owns, for which she lingering sighed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A dream of mingled terror and delight</line>
      <line>Still heavy hangs upon her troubled soul,</line>
      <line>An angry form still swims before her sight,</line>
      <line> And still the vengeful thunders seem to roll –</line>
      <line>Still crushed to earth she feels the stern control</line>
      <line>Of Venus unrelenting, unappeased.</line>
      <line>The dream returns, she feels the fancied dole:</line>
      <line>Once more the furies on her heart have seized,</line>
      <line>But still she views the youth who all her sufferings eased.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Of wondrous beauty did the vision seem,</line>
      <line>And in the freshest prime of youthful years –</line>
      <line>Such at the close of her distressful dream</line>
      <line>A graceful champion to her eyes appears!</line>
      <line> Her loved deliverer from her foes and fears</line>
      <line>She seems in grateful transport still to press;</line>
      <line>Still his soft voice sounds in her ravished ears.</line>
      <line>Dissolved in fondest tears of tenderness</line>
      <line>His form she oft invokes her waking eyes to bless.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor was it quite a dream, for as she woke,</line>
      <line>Ere heavenly mists concealed him from her eye,</line>
      <line>One sudden transitory view she took</line>
      <line>Of Love’s most radiant bright divinity.</line>
      <line>From the fair image never can she fly,</line>
      <line> As still consumed with vain desire she pines;</line>
      <line>While her fond parents heave the anxious sigh,</line>
      <line>And to avert her fate seek holy shrines</line>
      <line>The threatened ills to learn by auguries and signs.</line>

    <title>Gertrude of Wyoming II</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A valley, from the river-shore withdrawn,</line>
      <line>Was Albert’s home, two quiet woods between</line>
      <line>Whose lofty verdure overlooked his lawn;</line>
      <line>And waters to their resting-place serene</line>
      <line> Came freshening, and reflecting all the scene –</line>
      <line>A mirror in the depth of flowery shelves!</line>
      <line>So sweet a spot of earth you might (I ween)</line>
      <line>Have guessed some congregation of the elves</line>
      <line>To sport by summer moons had shaped it for themselves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet wanted not the eye far scope to muse,</line>
      <line>Nor vistas opened by the wandering stream;</line>
      <line>Both where at evening Allegany views,</line>
      <line>Through ridges burning in her western beam,</line>
      <line>Lake after lake interminably gleam –</line>
      <line> And past those settlers’ haunts the eye might roam,</line>
      <line>Where earth’s unliving silence all would seem,</line>
      <line>Save where on rocks the beaver built his dome</line>
      <line>Or buffalo remote lowed far from human home.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But silent not that adverse eastern path</line>
      <line>Which saw Aurora’s hills the horizon crown:</line>
      <line>There was the river heard, in bed of wrath</line>
      <line>(A precipice of foam from mountains brown),</line>
      <line>Like tumults heard from some far distant town –</line>
      <line>But, softening in approach, he left his gloom</line>
      <line> And murmured pleasantly, and laid him down</line>
      <line>To kiss those easy curving banks of bloom</line>
      <line>That lent the windward air an exquisite perfume.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It seemed as if those scenes sweet influence had</line>
      <line>On Gertrude’s soul, and kindness like their own</line>
      <line>Inspired those eyes affectionate and glad,</line>
      <line>That seemed to love whate’er they looked upon.</line>
      <line>Whether with Hebe’s mirth her features shone,</line>
      <line>Or if a shade more pleasing them o’ercast</line>
      <line>(As if for heavenly musing meant alone),</line>
      <line> Yet so becomingly the expression past</line>
      <line>That each succeeding look was lovelier than the last.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor, guess I, was that Pennsylvanian home,</line>
      <line>With all its picturesque and balmy grace,</line>
      <line>And fields that were a luxury to roam,</line>
      <line>Lost on the soul that looked from such a face!</line>
      <line>Enthusiast of the woods, when years apace</line>
      <line>Had bound thy lovely waist with woman’s zone,</line>
      <line>The sunrise-path at morn I see thee trace</line>
      <line>To hills with high magnolia overgrown,</line>
      <line> And joy to breathe the groves, romantic and alone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sunrise drew her thoughts to Europe forth</line>
      <line>That thus apostrophized its viewless scene:</line>
      <line>‘Land of my father’s love, my mother’s birth!</line>
      <line>The home of kindred I have never seen!</line>
      <line>We know not other – oceans are between –</line>
      <line>Yet say! far friendly hearts from whence we came,</line>
      <line>Of us does oft remembrance intervene?</line>
      <line>My mother sure, my sire, a thought may claim,</line>
      <line>But Gertrude is to you an unregarded name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And yet, loved England! when thy name I trace</line>
      <line>In many a pilgrim’s tale and poet’s song,</line>
      <line>How can I choose but wish for one embrace</line>
      <line>Of them, the dear unknown, to whom belong</line>
      <line>My mother’s looks – perhaps her likeness strong?</line>
      <line>Oh parent! with what reverential awe,</line>
      <line>From features of thine own related throng,</line>
      <line>An image of thy face my soul could draw –</line>
      <line>And see thee once again whom I too shortly saw!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet deem not Gertrude sighed for foreign joy –</line>
      <line> To soothe a father’s couch her only care,</line>
      <line>And keep his reverend head from all annoy.</line>
      <line>For this, methinks, her homeward steps repair</line>
      <line>Soon as the morning-wreath had bound her hair,</line>
      <line>While yet the wild deer trod in spangling dew,</line>
      <line>While boatman carolled to the fresh-blown air,</line>
      <line>And woods a horizontal shadow threw,</line>
      <line>And early fox appeared in momentary view.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At times there was a deep untrodden grot,</line>
      <line>Where of the reading-hours sweet Gertrude wore;</line>
      <line> Tradition had not named its lonely spot,</line>
      <line>But here, methinks, India’s sons explore</line>
      <line>Their father’s dust, or lift, perchance, of yore,</line>
      <line>Their voice to the Great Spirit – rocks sublime</line>
      <line>To human art a sportive semblance wore,</line>
      <line>And yellow lichens coloured all the clime</line>
      <line>Like moonlight battlements, and towers decayed by time.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But high, in amphitheatre above,</line>
      <line>His arms the everlasting aloes threw –</line>
      <line>Breathed but an air of Heaven, and all the grove</line>
      <line> As if with instinct living spirit grew,</line>
      <line>Rolling its verdant gulfs of every hue.</line>
      <line>And now suspended was the pleasing din,</line>
      <line>Now from a murmur faint it swelled anew –</line>
      <line>Like the first note of organ heard within</line>
      <line>Cathedral aisles, ere yet its symphony begin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was in this lone valley she would charm</line>
      <line>The lingering noon, where flowers a couch had strewn,</line>
      <line>Her cheek reclining, and her snowy arm</line>
      <line>On hillock by the palm-tree half o’ergrown –</line>
      <line> And aye that volume on her lap is thrown</line>
      <line>Which every heart of human mould endears:</line>
      <line>With Shakespeare’s self she speaks and smiles alone,</line>
      <line>And no intruding visitation fears</line>
      <line>To shame the unconscious laugh, or stop her sweetest tears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For, save her presence, scarce an ear had heard</line>
      <line>The stock-dove plaining through its gloom profound,</line>
      <line>Or winglet of the fairy humming-bird</line>
      <line>Like atoms of the rainbow fluttering round,</line>
      <line>Till chance had ushered to its inmost ground</line>
      <line>The stranger-guest of many a distant clime.</line>
      <line>He was (to weet) for eastern mountains bound,</line>
      <line>But late the equator suns his cheek had tanned,</line>
      <line>And California’s gales his roving bosom fanned.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A steed, whose rein hung loosely o’er his arm,</line>
      <line>He led dismounted; ere his leisure pace</line>
      <line>Amid the brown leaves could her ear alarm</line>
      <line>Close he had come, and worshipped for a space</line>
      <line>Those downcast features – she her lovely face</line>
      <line>Uplift on one whose lineaments and frame</line>
      <line> Wore youth and manhood’s intermingled grace:</line>
      <line>Iberian seemed his boot, his robe the same,</line>
      <line>And well the Spanish plume his lofty looks became.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For Albert’s home he sought – her finger fair</line>
      <line>Has pointed where the father’s mansion stood.</line>
      <line>Returning from the copse, he soon was there;</line>
      <line>And soon has Gertrude hied from dark green wood,</line>
      <line>Nor joyless, by the converse, understood,</line>
      <line>Between the man of age and pilgrim young –</line>
      <line>That gay congeniality of mood</line>
      <line> And early liking from acquaintance sprung.</line>
      <line>Full fluently conversed their guest in England’s tongue,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And well could he his pilgrimage of taste</line>
      <line>Unfold, and much they loved his fervid strain</line>
      <line>While he each fair variety retraced</line>
      <line>Of climes, and manners, o’er the eastern main:</line>
      <line>Now happy Switzer’s hills, romantic Spain,</line>
      <line>Gay lilied fields of France, or, more refined,</line>
      <line>The soft Ausonia’s monumental reign –</line>
      <line>Nor less each rural image he designed</line>
      <line> Than all the city’s pomp, and home of human kind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Anon some wilder portraiture he draws:</line>
      <line>Of Nature’s savage glories he would speak –</line>
      <line>The loneliness of Earth that overawes</line>
      <line>Where, resting by some tomb of old cacique,</line>
      <line>The lama-driver on Peruvia’s peak</line>
      <line>Nor voice, nor living motion, marks around,</line>
      <line>But storks that to the boundless forest shriek,</line>
      <line>Or wild-cane arch high flung o’er gulf profound,</line>
      <line>That fluctuates when the storms of El Dorado sound!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Pleased with his guest, the good man still would ply</line>
      <line>Each earnest question, and his converse court;</line>
      <line>But Gertrude, as she eyed him, knew not why</line>
      <line>A strange and troubling wonder stopped her short.</line>
      <line>‘In England thou hast been, and by report</line>
      <line>An orphan’s name’, quoth Albert, ‘mayst have known.</line>
      <line>Sad tale! When latest fell our frontier-fort</line>
      <line>One innocent, one soldier’s child, alone</line>
      <line>Was spared, and brought to me, who loved him as my own.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Young Henry Waldegrave – three delightful years</line>
      <line> These very walls his infant sports did see –</line>
      <line>But most I loved him when his parting tears</line>
      <line>Alternately bedewed my child and me.</line>
      <line>His sorest parting, Gertrude, was from thee –</line>
      <line>Nor half his grief his little heart could hold!</line>
      <line>By kindred he was sent for o’er the sea,</line>
      <line>They tore him from us when but twelve years old,</line>
      <line>And scarcely for his loss have I been yet consoled.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His face the wanderer hid, but could not hide</line>
      <line>A tear, a smile, upon his cheek that dwell.</line>
      <line> ‘And speak, mysterious stranger!’ Gertrude cried,</line>
      <line>‘It is – it is – I knew – I knew him well!</line>
      <line>’Tis Waldegrave’s self, of Waldegrave come to tell!’</line>
      <line>A burst of joy the father’s lips declare,</line>
      <line>But Gertrude speechless on his bosom fell:</line>
      <line>At once his open arms embraced the pair –</line>
      <line>Was never group more blest in this wide world of care!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And will ye pardon then’, replied the youth,</line>
      <line>‘Your Waldegrave’s feignéd name, and false attire?</line>
      <line>I durst not in the neighbourhood, in truth,</line>
      <line> The very fortunes of your house inquire,</line>
      <line>Lest one that knew me might some tidings dire</line>
      <line>Impart, and I my weakness all betray;</line>
      <line>For had I lost my Gertrude, and my sire,</line>
      <line>I meant but o’er your tombs to weep a day –</line>
      <line>Unknown I meant to weep, unknown to pass away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But here ye live, ye bloom! In each dear face</line>
      <line>The changing hand of time I may not blame:</line>
      <line>For there it hath but shed more reverend grace,</line>
      <line>And here, of beauty perfected the frame –</line>
      <line> And well I know your hearts are still the same!</line>
      <line>They could not change – ye look the very way</line>
      <line>As when an orphan first to you I came!</line>
      <line>And have ye heard of my poor guide, I pray –</line>
      <line>Nay, wherefore weep we, friends, on such a joyous day?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And art thou here – or is it but a dream?</line>
      <line>And wilt thou, Waldegrave, wilt thou leave us more?’</line>
      <line>‘No, never! Thou that yet dost lovelier seem</line>
      <line>Than aught on earth – than even thyself of yore –</line>
      <line>I will not part thee from thy father’s shore,</line>
      <line> But we shall cherish him with mutual arms,</line>
      <line>And hand-in-hand again the path explore</line>
      <line>Which every ray of young remembrance warms,</line>
      <line>While thou shalt be my own with all thy truth and charms!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At morn, as if beneath a galaxy</line>
      <line>Of over-arching groves in blossoms white</line>
      <line>(Where all was odorous scent and harmony,</line>
      <line>And gladness to the heart, nerve, ear and sight),</line>
      <line>There if, oh gentle love, I read aright</line>
      <line>The utterance that sealed thy sacred bond,</line>
      <line>’Twas – listening to these accents of delight –</line>
      <line>She hid upon his breast those eyes beyond</line>
      <line>Expression’s power to paint, all languishingly fond.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Flower of my life, so lovely and so lone!</line>
      <line>Whom I would rather in this desert meet,</line>
      <line>Scorning (and scorned by) Fortune’s power, than own</line>
      <line>Her pomp and splendours lavished at my feet!</line>
      <line>Turn not from me thy breath, more exquisite</line>
      <line>Than odours cast on Heaven’s own shrine – to please –</line>
      <line>Give me thy love, than luxury more sweet,</line>
      <line> And more than all the wealth that loads the breeze</line>
      <line>When Coromandel’s ships return form Indian seas!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then would the home admit them – happier far</line>
      <line>Than grandeur’s most magnificent saloon –</line>
      <line>While here and there a solitary star</line>
      <line>Flushed in the darkening firmament of June,</line>
      <line>And silence brought the soul-felt hour, full soon,</line>
      <line>Ineffable, which I may not portray –</line>
      <line>For never did the Hymenean moon</line>
      <line>A paradise of hearts more sacred sway</line>
      <line> In all that slept beneath her soft voluptuous ray!</line>

    <title>The Bride of Abydos</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Zuleika mute and motionless</line>
      <line>Stood, like that statue of distress</line>
      <line>When (her last hope forever gone)</line>
      <line>The mother hardened into stone –</line>
      <line> All in the maid that eye could see</line>
      <line>Was but a younger Niobe!</line>
      <line>But ere her lip, or even her eye,</line>
      <line>Essayed to speak or look reply,</line>
      <line>Beneath the garden’s wicket-porch</line>
      <line>Far flashed on high a blazing torch –</line>
      <line>Another – and another – and another!</line>
      <line>‘Oh fly – no more, yet now my more than brother!’</line>
      <line>Far, wide, through every thicket spread,</line>
      <line>The fearful lights are gleaming red –</line>
      <line>Nor these alone, for each right hand</line>
      <line>Is ready with a sheathless brand.</line>
      <line>They part, pursue, return and wheel,</line>
      <line>With searching flambeau, shining steel;</line>
      <line>And last of all, his sabre waving,</line>
      <line>Stern Giaffir in his fury raving!</line>
      <line>And now almost they touch the cave –</line>
      <line>Oh, must that grot be Selim’s grave?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dauntless he stood – ‘’Tis come – soon past –</line>
      <line>One kiss, Zuleika – ’tis my last!</line>
      <line> But yet my band, not far from shore,</line>
      <line>May hear this signal, see the flash –</line>
      <line>Yet now too few, the attempt were rash –</line>
      <line>No matter – yet one effort more!’</line>
      <line>Forth to the cavern-mouth he stepped –</line>
      <line>His pistol’s echo rang on high –</line>
      <line>Zuleika started not, nor wept,</line>
      <line>Despair benumbed her breast and eye.</line>
      <line>‘They hear me not! Or if they ply</line>
      <line>Their oars, ’tis but to see me die!</line>
      <line> That sound hath drawn my foes more nigh –</line>
      <line>Then forth my father’s scimitar –</line>
      <line>Thou ne’er hast seen less equal war!</line>
      <line>Farewell, Zuleika! Sweet, retire –</line>
      <line>Yet stay within – here linger, safe –</line>
      <line>At thee his rage will only chafe.</line>
      <line>Stir not, lest even to thee perchance</line>
      <line>Some erring blade or ball should glance.</line>
      <line>Fearst thou for him? May I expire</line>
      <line>If in this strife I seek thy sire!</line>
      <line> No – though by him that poison poured!</line>
      <line>No – though he called me coward!</line>
      <line>But tamely shall I meet their steel?</line>
      <line>No – as each crest, save his, may feel!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One bound he made, and gained the sand:</line>
      <line>Already at his feet hath sunk</line>
      <line>The foremost of the prying band,</line>
      <line>A gasping head, a quivering trunk!</line>
      <line>Another falls – but round him close</line>
      <line>A swarming circle of his foes.</line>
      <line> From right to left his path he cleft,</line>
      <line>And almost met the meeting wave!</line>
      <line>His boat appears – not five oars’ length –</line>
      <line>His comrades strain with desperate strength!</line>
      <line>Oh, are they yet in time to save?</line>
      <line>His feet the foremost breakers lave,</line>
      <line>His band are plunging in the bay –</line>
      <line>Their sabres glitter through the spray –</line>
      <line>Wet, wild, unwearied, to the strand</line>
      <line>They struggle – now they touch the land!</line>
      <line> They come – ’tis but to add to slaughter –</line>
      <line>His heart’s best blood is on the water.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Escaped from shot, unharmed by steel,</line>
      <line>Or scarcely grazed its force to feel,</line>
      <line>Had Selim won – betrayed, beset –</line>
      <line>To where the strand and billows met.</line>
      <line>There, as his last step left the land,</line>
      <line>And the last death-blow dealt his hand,</line>
      <line>Ah, wherefore did he turn to look</line>
      <line>For her his eye but sought in vain?</line>
      <line> That pause, that fatal gaze he took,</line>
      <line>Hath doomed his death, or fixed his chain.</line>
      <line>Sad proof, in peril and in pain</line>
      <line>How late will lover’s hope remain!</line>
      <line>His back was to the dashing spray –</line>
      <line>Behind, but close, his comrades lay –</line>
      <line>When, at the instant, hissed the ball:</line>
      <line>‘So may the foes of Giaffir fall!’</line>
      <line>Whose voice is heard? Whose carbine rang?</line>
      <line>Whose bullet through the night-air sang</line>
      <line> Too nearly, deadly, aimed to err?</line>
      <line>’Tis thine, Abdallah’s murderer!</line>
      <line>The father slowly rued thy hate,</line>
      <line>The son hath found a quicker fate:</line>
      <line>Fast from his breast the blood is bubbling,</line>
      <line>The whiteness of the sea-foam troubling –</line>
      <line>If aught his lips essayed to groan,</line>
      <line>The rushing billows choked the tone!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Morn slowly rolls the clouds away,</line>
      <line>Few trophies of the fight are there.</line>
      <line> The shouts that shook the midnight-bay</line>
      <line>Are silent; but some signs of fray</line>
      <line>That strand of strife may bear,</line>
      <line>And fragments of each shivered brand;</line>
      <line>Steps stamped; and, dashed into the sand,</line>
      <line>The print of many a struggling hand</line>
      <line>May there be marked – nor far remote</line>
      <line>A broken torch, an oarless boat.</line>
      <line>And, tangled on the weeds that heap</line>
      <line>The beach where shelving to the deep,</line>
      <line> There lies a white capote!</line>
      <line>’Tis rent in twain – one dark-red stain</line>
      <line>The wave yet ripples o’er in vain –</line>
      <line>But where is he who wore?</line>
      <line>Ye, who would o’er his relics weep,</line>
      <line>Go, seek them where the surges sweep</line>
      <line>Their burden round Sigaeum’s steep</line>
      <line>And cast on Lemnos’ shore.</line>
      <line>The sea-birds shriek above the prey,</line>
      <line>O’er which their hungry beaks delay,</line>
      <line>As shaken on his restless pillow</line>
      <line>His head heaves with the heaving billow.</line>
      <line>That hand, whose motion is not life,</line>
      <line>Yet freely seems to menace strife,</line>
      <line>Flung by the tossing tide on high,</line>
      <line>Then levelled with the wave –</line>
      <line>What recks it, though that corse shall lie</line>
      <line>Within a living grave?</line>
      <line>The bird that tears that prostrate form</line>
      <line>Hath only robbed the meaner worm!</line>
      <line> The only heart, the only eye,</line>
      <line>Had bled or wept to see him die,</line>
      <line>Had seen those scattered limbs composed,</line>
      <line>And mourned above his turban-stone –</line>
      <line>That heart hath burst, that eye was closed,</line>
      <line>Yea – closed before his own!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By Helle’s stream there is a voice of wail!</line>
      <line>And woman’s eye is wet, man’s cheek is pale.</line>
      <line>Zuleika – last of Giaffir’s race –</line>
      <line>Thy destined lord is come too late:</line>
      <line> He sees not, ne’er shall see, thy face!</line>
      <line>Can he not hear</line>
      <line>The loud wull-wulley warn his distant ear?</line>
      <line>Thy handmaids weeping at the gate,</line>
      <line>The Koran-chanters of the hymn of fate,</line>
      <line>The silent slaves with folded arms that wait,</line>
      <line>Sighs in the hall, and shrieks upon the gale,</line>
      <line>Tell him thy tale.</line>
      <line>Thou didst not view thy Selim fall:</line>
      <line>That fearful moment when he left the cave</line>
      <line> Thy heart grew chill!</line>
      <line>He was thy hope, thy joy, thy love, thine all,</line>
      <line>And that last thought on him thou couldst not save</line>
      <line>Sufficed to kill –</line>
      <line>Burst forth in one wild cry, and all was still!</line>
      <line>Peace to thy broken heart and virgin grave!</line>
      <line>Ah happy, but of life to lose the worst –</line>
      <line>That grief, though deep, though fatal, was thy first!</line>
      <line>Thrice happy, ne’er to feel or fear the force</line>
      <line>Of absence, shame, pride, hate, revenge, remorse,</line>
      <line> And oh, that pang where more than madness lies –</line>
      <line>The worm that will not sleep, and never dies –</line>
      <line>Thought of the gloomy day and ghastly night,</line>
      <line>That dreads the darkness, and yet loathes the light,</line>
      <line>That winds around, and tears, the quivering heart!</line>
      <line>Ah, wherefore not consume it, and depart?</line>
      <line>Woe to thee, rash and unrelenting chief!</line>
      <line>Vainly thou heapst the dust upon thy head,</line>
      <line>Vainly the sackcloth o’er thy limbs dost spread –</line>
      <line>By that same hand Abdallah, Selim, bled!</line>
      <line> Now let it tear thy beard in idle grief:</line>
      <line>Thy pride of heart, thy bride for Osman’s bed,</line>
      <line>She whom thy Sultan had but seen to wed,</line>
      <line>Thy daughter’s dead!</line>
      <line>Hope of thine age, thy twilight’s lonely beam,</line>
      <line>The star hath set that shone on Helle’s stream –</line>
      <line>What quenched its ray? The blood that thou hast shed.</line>
      <line>Hark to the hurried question of despair:</line>
      <line>‘Where is my child?’ An echo answers, ‘Where!’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The Poet wandering on, through Araby</line>
      <line>And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,</line>
      <line>And o’er the aerial mountains which pour down</line>
      <line>Indus and Oxus from their icy caves,</line>
      <line>In joy and exultation held his way,</line>
      <line> Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within</line>
      <line>Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine</line>
      <line>Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,</line>
      <line>Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched</line>
      <line>His languid limbs.</line>
      <line>A vision on his sleep</line>
      <line>There came – a dream of hopes that never yet</line>
      <line>Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veiléd maid</line>
      <line>Sat near him, talking in low tones.</line>
      <line>Her voice was like the voice of his own soul</line>
      <line>Heard in the calm of thought: its music long,</line>
      <line> Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held</line>
      <line>His inmost sense suspended in its web</line>
      <line>Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues.</line>
      <line>Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,</line>
      <line>And lofty hopes of divine liberty</line>
      <line>(The thoughts most dear to him), and poesy –</line>
      <line>Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood</line>
      <line>Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame</line>
      <line>A permeating fire: wild numbers then</line>
      <line>She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs</line>
      <line> Subdued by its own pathos. Her fair hands</line>
      <line>Were bare alone, sweeping from strange harp</line>
      <line>Strange symphony, and in their branching veins</line>
      <line>The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.</line>
      <line>The beating of her heart was heard to fill</line>
      <line>The pauses of her music, and her breath</line>
      <line>Tumultuously accorded with those fits</line>
      <line>Of intermitted song.</line>
      <line>Sudden she rose,</line>
      <line>As if her heart impatiently endured</line>
      <line>Its bursting burden. At the sound he turned,</line>
      <line> And saw by the warm light of their own life</line>
      <line>Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil</line>
      <line>Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,</line>
      <line>Her dark locks floating in the breath of night,</line>
      <line>Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips</line>
      <line>Outstretched and pale, and quivering eagerly.</line>
      <line>His strong heart sank and sickened with excess</line>
      <line>Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled</line>
      <line>His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet</line>
      <line>Her panting bosom. She drew back a while,</line>
      <line> Then, yielding to the irresistible joy,</line>
      <line>With frantic gesture and short breathless cry</line>
      <line>Folded his frame in her dissolving arms.</line>
      <line>Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night</line>
      <line>Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,</line>
      <line>Like a dark flood suspended in its course,</line>
      <line>Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.</line>
      <line>Roused by the shock, he started from his trance –</line>
      <line>The cold white light of morning, the blue moon</line>
      <line>Low in the west, the clear and garish hills,</line>
      <line> The distinct valley and the vacant woods,</line>
      <line>Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled</line>
      <line>The hues of heaven that canopied his bower</line>
      <line>Of yesternight, the sounds that soothed his sleep,</line>
      <line>The mystery and the majesty of Earth,</line>
      <line>The joy and exultation? His wan eyes</line>
      <line>Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly</line>
      <line>As Ocean’s moon looks on the moon in heaven.</line>
      <line>The spirit of sweet human love has sent</line>
      <line>A vision to the sleep of him who spurned</line>
      <line>Her choicest gifts.</line>
      <line>He eagerly pursues</line>
      <line>Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade –</line>
      <line>He overleaps the bounds! Alas, alas,</line>
      <line>Were limbs, and breath, and being, intertwined</line>
      <line>Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost,</line>
      <line>In the wide pathless desert of deep sleep,</line>
      <line>That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of Death</line>
      <line>Conduct to thy mysterious paradise,</line>
      <line>Oh Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds,</line>
      <line>And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake,</line>
      <line> Lead only to a black and watery depth,</line>
      <line>While Death’s blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung</line>
      <line>(Where every shade which the foul grave exhales</line>
      <line>Hides its dead eye from the detested day),</line>
      <line>Conduct, oh Sleep, to thy delightful realms?</line>
      <line>This doubt, with sudden tide, flowed on his heart;</line>
      <line>The insatiate hope which it awakened stung</line>
      <line>His brain even like despair.</line>

    <title>Paulo and Francesca</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>All the green garden, flower-bed, shade, and plot,</line>
      <line>Francesca loved but most of all this spot:</line>
      <line>Whenever she walked forth, wherever went</line>
      <line> About the grounds, to this at last she bent.</line>
      <line>Here she had brought a lute and a few books;</line>
      <line>Here would she lie for hours, with grateful looks,</line>
      <line>Thanking at heart the sunshine and the leaves,</line>
      <line>The summer rain-drops counting from the eaves,</line>
      <line>And all that promising, calm smile we see</line>
      <line>In Nature’s face, when we look patiently.</line>
      <line>Then would she think of Heaven; and you might hear</line>
      <line>Sometimes, when everything was hushed and clear,</line>
      <line>Her gentle voice from out those shades emerging,</line>
      <line> Singing the evening anthem to the Virgin.</line>
      <line>The gardeners and the rest, who served the place</line>
      <line>And blest – whenever they beheld – her face,</line>
      <line>Knelt when they heard it, bowing and uncovered,</line>
      <line>And felt as if in air some sainted beauty hovered.</line>
      <line>One day – ’twas on a summer afternoon,</line>
      <line>When airs and gurgling brooks are best in tune,</line>
      <line>And grasshoppers are loud, and day-work done,</line>
      <line>And shades have heavy outlines in the sun –</line>
      <line>The princess came to her accustomed bower</line>
      <line>To get her, if she could, a soothing hour,</line>
      <line>Trying, as she was used, to leave her cares</line>
      <line>Without, and slumberously enjoy the airs</line>
      <line>And the low-talking leaves, and that cool light</line>
      <line>The vines let in, and all that hushing sight</line>
      <line>Of closing wood seen through the opening door,</line>
      <line>And distant plash of waters tumbling o’er,</line>
      <line>And smell of citron blooms – and fifty luxuries more!</line>
      <line>She tried, as usual, for the trial’s sake –</line>
      <line>For even that diminished her heartache,</line>
      <line> And never yet (how ill soe’er at ease)</line>
      <line>Came she for nothing midst the flowers and trees.</line>
      <line>Yet somehow or another, on that day,</line>
      <line>She seemed to feel too lightly borne away –</line>
      <line>Too much relieved – too much inclined to draw</line>
      <line>A careless joy from everything she saw;</line>
      <line>And looking round her with a new-born eye,</line>
      <line>As if some tree of knowledge had been nigh,</line>
      <line>To taste of Nature, primitive and free,</line>
      <line>And bask at ease in her heart’s liberty.</line>
      <line> Painfully clear those rising thoughts appeared,</line>
      <line>With something dark at bottom that she feared;</line>
      <line>And snatching from the fields her thoughtful look,</line>
      <line>She reached o’er-head, and took her down a book,</line>
      <line>And fell to reading with as fixed an air,</line>
      <line>As though she had been wrapt since morning there.</line>
      <line>’Twas Launcelot of the Lake, a bright romance,</line>
      <line>That like a trumpet made young pulses dance,</line>
      <line>Yet had a softer note that shook still more.</line>
      <line>She had begun it but the day before,</line>
      <line> And read with a full heart, half sweet, half sad,</line>
      <line>How old King Ban was spoiled of all he had</line>
      <line>But one fair castle – how one summer’s day</line>
      <line>With his fair queen and child he went away</line>
      <line>To ask the great King Arthur for assistance;</line>
      <line>How, reaching by himself a hill at distance,</line>
      <line>He turned to give his castle a last look,</line>
      <line>And saw its far white face – and how a smoke,</line>
      <line>As he was looking, burst in volumes forth,</line>
      <line>And good King Ban saw all that he was worth,</line>
      <line> And his fair castle, burning to the ground,</line>
      <line>So that his wearied pulse felt over-wound,</line>
      <line>And he lay down, and said a prayer apart</line>
      <line>For those he loved, and broke his poor old heart.</line>
      <line>Then read she of the Queen with her young child,</line>
      <line>How she came up, and nearly had gone wild,</line>
      <line>And how, in journeying on in her despair,</line>
      <line>She reached a lake and met a lady there</line>
      <line>Who pitied her, and took the baby sweet</line>
      <line>Into her arms, when lo, with closing feet</line>
      <line> She sprang up all at once, like bird from brake,</line>
      <line>And vanished with him underneath the lake!</line>
      <line>The mother’s feelings we as well may pass –</line>
      <line>The fairy of the place that lady was,</line>
      <line>And Launcelot (so the boy was called) became</line>
      <line>Her inmate, till in search of knightly fame</line>
      <line>He went to Arthur’s court, and played his part</line>
      <line>So rarely, and displayed so frank a heart,</line>
      <line>That what with all his charms of look and limb,</line>
      <line>The Queen Genevra fell in love with him.</line>
      <line> And here, with growing interest in her reading,</line>
      <line>The princess, doubly fixed, was now proceeding.</line>
      <line>Ready she sat with one hand to turn o’er</line>
      <line>The leaf, to which her thoughts ran on before,</line>
      <line>The other propping her white brow, and throwing</line>
      <line>Its ringlets out, under the sky-light glowing.</line>
      <line>So sat she fixed; and so observed was she</line>
      <line>Of one, who at the door stood tenderly –</line>
      <line>Paulo – who, from a window seeing her</line>
      <line>Go straight across the lawn, and guessing where,</line>
      <line> Had thought she was in tears, and found, that day,</line>
      <line>His usual efforts vain to keep away.</line>
      <line>‘May I come in?’ said he. It made her start,</line>
      <line>That smiling voice – she coloured, pressed her heart</line>
      <line>A moment (as for breath), and then with free</line>
      <line>And usual tone said ‘Oh yes, certainly!’</line>
      <line>There’s apt to be, at conscious times like these,</line>
      <line>An affectation of a bright-eyed ease,</line>
      <line>An air of something quite serene and sure,</line>
      <line>As if to seem so, was to be, secure:</line>
      <line> With this the lovers met, with this they spoke,</line>
      <line>With this they sat down to the self-same book,</line>
      <line>And Paulo, by degrees, gently embraced</line>
      <line>With one permitted arm her lovely waist;</line>
      <line>And both their cheeks, like peaches on a tree,</line>
      <line>Leaned with a touch together, thrillingly;</line>
      <line>And o’er the book they hung, and nothing said,</line>
      <line>And every lingering page grew longer as they read.</line>
      <line>As thus they sat, and felt with leaps of heart</line>
      <line>Their colour change, they came upon the part</line>
      <line> Where fond Genevra, with her flame long nurst,</line>
      <line>Smiled upon Launcelot when he kissed her first!</line>
      <line>That touch, at last, through every fibre slid,</line>
      <line>And Paulo turned, scarce knowing what he did,</line>
      <line>Only he felt he could no more dissemble,</line>
      <line>And kissed her, mouth to mouth, all in a tremble.</line>
      <line>Sad were those hearts, and sweet was that long kiss:</line>
      <line>Sacred be love from sight, whate’er it is!</line>
      <line>The world was all forgot, the struggle o’er –</line>
      <line>Desperate the joy! That day they read no more.</line>

    <title>The Fire-Worshippers</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>She loves – but knows not whom she loves,</line>
      <line>Nor what his race, nor whence he came –</line>
      <line>Like one who meets, in Indian groves,</line>
      <line>Some beauteous bird, without a name,</line>
      <line>Brought by the last ambrosial breeze</line>
      <line>From isles in the undiscovered seas</line>
      <line>To show his plumage for a day</line>
      <line>To wondering eyes, and wing away!</line>
      <line>Will he thus fly – her nameless lover?</line>
      <line>Allah forbid! ’Twas by a moon</line>
      <line>As fair as this, while singing over</line>
      <line>Some ditty to her soft kanoon,</line>
      <line>Alone, at this same witching-hour,</line>
      <line>She first beheld his radiant eyes</line>
      <line> Gleam through the lattice of the bower</line>
      <line>Where nightly now they mix their sighs,</line>
      <line>And thought some spirit of the air</line>
      <line>(For what could waft a mortal there?)</line>
      <line>Was pausing on his moonlight way</line>
      <line>To listen to her lonely lay!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This fancy ne’er hath left her mind,</line>
      <line>And though, when terror’s swoon had passed,</line>
      <line>She saw a youth of mortal kind</line>
      <line>Before her in obeisance cast,</line>
      <line> Yet often since, when he has spoken</line>
      <line>Strange, awful words, and gleams have broken</line>
      <line>From his dark eyes too bright to bear,</line>
      <line>Oh, she hath feared her soul was given</line>
      <line>To some unhallowed child of air,</line>
      <line>Some erring spirit, cast from Heaven,</line>
      <line>Like those angelic youths of old,</line>
      <line>Who burned for maids of mortal mould,</line>
      <line>Bewildered left the glorious skies,</line>
      <line>And lost their Heaven for woman’s eyes!</line>
      <line> Fond girl – nor fiend nor angel he,</line>
      <line>Who woos thy young simplicity,</line>
      <line>But one of Earth’s impassioned sons</line>
      <line>As warm in love, as fierce in ire,</line>
      <line>As the best here whose current runs</line>
      <line>Full of the Day-God’s living fire!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But quenched tonight that ardour seems,</line>
      <line>And pale his cheek, and sunk his brow.</line>
      <line>Never before, but in her dreams,</line>
      <line>Had she beheld him pale as now –</line>
      <line> And those were dreams of troubled sleep</line>
      <line>From which ’twas joy to wake and weep,</line>
      <line>Visions that will not be forgot</line>
      <line>But sadden every waking scene</line>
      <line>Like warning ghosts, that leave the spot</line>
      <line>All withered where they once have been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘How sweetly’, said the trembling maid,</line>
      <line>Of her own gentle voice afraid</line>
      <line>(So long had they in silence stood,</line>
      <line>Looking upon that moonlight flood) –</line>
      <line> ‘How sweetly does the moonbeam smile</line>
      <line>Tonight upon yon leafy isle!</line>
      <line>I’ve wished that little isle had wings,</line>
      <line>And we, within its fairy-bowers,</line>
      <line>Were wafted off to seas unknown</line>
      <line>Where not a pulse should beat but ours</line>
      <line>And we might live, love, die, alone,</line>
      <line>Far from the cruel and the cold,</line>
      <line>Where the bright eyes of angels only</line>
      <line>Should come around us to behold</line>
      <line> A paradise so pure and lonely!</line>
      <line>Would this be world enough for thee?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Playful she turned, that he might see</line>
      <line>The passing smile her cheek put on;</line>
      <line>But when she marked how mournfully</line>
      <line>His eyes met hers, that smile was gone,</line>
      <line>And, bursting into heart-felt tears,</line>
      <line>‘Yes, yes’, she cried, ‘my hourly fears,</line>
      <line>My dreams, have boded all too right –</line>
      <line>We part, for ever part, tonight!</line>
      <line> I knew, I knew, it could not last –</line>
      <line>’Twas bright, ’twas heavenly, but ’tis past!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh ever thus, from childhood’s hour,</line>
      <line>I’ve seen my fondest hopes decay –</line>
      <line>I never loved a tree or flower,</line>
      <line>But ’twas the first to fade away!</line>
      <line>I never nursed a dear gazelle,</line>
      <line>To glad me with its soft black eye,</line>
      <line>But when it came to know me well,</line>
      <line>And love me, it was sure to die!</line>
      <line> Now too, the joy most like divine</line>
      <line>Of all I ever dreamed or knew,</line>
      <line>To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine –</line>
      <line>Oh misery! must I lose that too?</line>
      <line>Yet go! On peril’s brink we meet:</line>
      <line>Those frightful rocks, that treacherous sea –</line>
      <line>No, never come again – though sweet,</line>
      <line>Though heaven, it may be death to thee!</line>
      <line>Farewell, and blessings on thy way</line>
      <line>Where’er thou goest, belovéd stranger!</line>
      <line> Better to sit and watch that ray,</line>
      <line>And think thee safe, though far away,</line>
      <line>Than have thee near me and in danger!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Danger – oh tempt me not to boast!’</line>
      <line>The youth exclaimed, ‘Thou little knowest</line>
      <line>What he can brave, who, born and nursed</line>
      <line>In Danger’s paths, has dared the worst –</line>
      <line>Upon whose ear the signal-word</line>
      <line>Of strife and death is hourly breaking,</line>
      <line>Who sleeps with head upon the sword</line>
      <line>His fevered hand must grasp in waking!</line>
      <line>Danger!’</line>
      <line>‘Say on! Thou fearest not then,</line>
      <line>And we may meet – oft meet again?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh look not so! Beneath the skies</line>
      <line>I now fear nothing but those eyes.</line>
      <line>If aught on earth could charm or force</line>
      <line>My spirit from its destined course –</line>
      <line>If aught could make this soul forget</line>
      <line>The bond to which its seal is set,</line>
      <line>’Twould be those eyes – they, only they,</line>
      <line> Could melt that sacred seal away!</line>
      <line>But no – ’tis fixed – my awful doom</line>
      <line>Is fixed! On this side of the tomb</line>
      <line>We meet no more – why, why, did Heaven</line>
      <line>Mingle two souls that Earth has riven,</line>
      <line>Has rent asunder, wide as ours?</line>
      <line>Oh arab maid – as soon the powers</line>
      <line>Of light and darkness may combine</line>
      <line>As I be linked with thee, or thine!</line>
      <line>Thy father –’</line>
      <line>‘Holy Allah save</line>
      <line> His gray head from that lightning glance!</line>
      <line>Thou knowest him not – he loves the brave,</line>
      <line>Nor lives their under heaven’s expanse</line>
      <line>One who would prize, would worship thee</line>
      <line>And thy bold spirit, more than he!</line>
      <line>Oft when in childhood I have played</line>
      <line>With the bright falchion by his side,</line>
      <line>I’ve heard him swear his lisping maid</line>
      <line>In time should be a warrior’s bride.</line>
      <line>And still, whene’er at haram-hours,</line>
      <line> I take him cool sherbets and flowers,</line>
      <line>He tells me (when in playful mood)</line>
      <line>A hero shall my bridegroom be –</line>
      <line>Since maids are best in battle wooed,</line>
      <line>And won mid shouts of victory!</line>
      <line>Nay, turn not from me – thou alone</line>
      <line>Art formed to make both hearts thy own!</line>
      <line>Go, join his sacred ranks – thou knowest</line>
      <line>The unholy strife these Persians wage –</line>
      <line>Good Heaven, that frown! Even now thou glowest</line>
      <line> With more than mortal warrior’s rage!</line>
      <line>Haste to the camp by morning’s light,</line>
      <line>And when that sword is raised in fight</line>
      <line>Oh still remember love and I</line>
      <line>Beneath its shadow trembling lie!</line>
      <line>One victory o’er those slaves of fire –</line>
      <line>Those impious Ghebers, whom my sire</line>
      <line>Abhors –’</line>
      <line>‘Hold, hold – thy words are death!’</line>
      <line>The stranger cried, as wild he flung</line>
      <line>His mantle back, and showed beneath</line>
      <line> The Gheber belt that round him clung:</line>
      <line>‘Here, maiden, look – weep – blush, to see</line>
      <line>All that thy sire abhors in me!</line>
      <line>Yes! I am of that impious race –</line>
      <line>Those ‘slaves of fire’ who, morn and even,</line>
      <line>Hail their Creator’s dwelling-place</line>
      <line>Among the living lights of Heaven!</line>
      <line>Yes! I am of that outcast few,</line>
      <line>To Iran and to vengeance true,</line>
      <line>Who curse the hour your arabs came</line>
      <line> To desolate our shrines of flame –</line>
      <line>And swear, before God’s burning eye,</line>
      <line>To break our country’s chains, or die!</line>
      <line>Thy bigot sire – nay, tremble not –</line>
      <line>He who gave birth to those dear eyes</line>
      <line>With me is sacred as the spot</line>
      <line>From which our fires of worship rise!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But know, ’twas he I sought that night</line>
      <line>When from my watch-boat on the sea</line>
      <line>I caught this turret’s glimmering light,</line>
      <line> And up the rude rocks desperately</line>
      <line>Rushed to my prey! Thou knowest the rest –</line>
      <line>I climbed the gory vulture’s nest,</line>
      <line>And found a trembling dove within!</line>
      <line>Thine, thine, the victory – thine the sin –</line>
      <line>If Love has made one thought his own</line>
      <line>Which Vengeance claims first – last – alone!</line>
      <line>Oh, had we never, never met,</line>
      <line>Or could this heart even now forget</line>
      <line>How linked, how blest, we might have been,</line>
      <line> Had Fate not frowned so dark between!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hadst thou been born a Persian maid,</line>
      <line>In neighbouring valleys had we dwelt,</line>
      <line>Through the same fields in childhood played,</line>
      <line>At the same kindling altar knelt,</line>
      <line>While all those nameless ties</line>
      <line>In which the charm of Country lies</line>
      <line>Had round our hearts been hourly spun,</line>
      <line>Till Iran’s cause and thine were one –</line>
      <line>While in thy lute’s awakening sigh</line>
      <line> I heard the voice of days gone by</line>
      <line>And saw in every smile of thine</line>
      <line>Returning hours of glory shine –</line>
      <line>While the wronged spirit of our land</line>
      <line>Lived, looked and spoke, her wrongs through thee!</line>
      <line>God! who could then this sword withstand?</line>
      <line>Its very flash were victory!</line>
      <line>But now, estranged, divorced for ever</line>
      <line>Far as the grasp of Fate can sever,</line>
      <line>Our only ties what love has wove</line>
      <line>(Faith, friends, and country, sundered wide),</line>
      <line>And then, then only, true to love,</line>
      <line>When false to all that’s dear beside;</line>
      <line>Thy father Iran’s deadliest foe,</line>
      <line>Thyself perhaps even now – but no!</line>
      <line>Hate never looked so lovely yet!</line>
      <line>No – sacred to thy soul will be</line>
      <line>The land of him who could forget</line>
      <line>All but that bleeding land for thee!</line>
      <line>When other eyes shall see, unmoved,</line>
      <line> Her widows mourn, her warriors fall,</line>
      <line>Thou’lt think how well one Gheber loved,</line>
      <line>And for his sake thou’lt weep for all.</line>
      <line>But look!’</line>
      <line>With sudden start he turned</line>
      <line>And pointed to the distant wave</line>
      <line>Where lights, like charnel meteors, burned</line>
      <line>Bluely, as o’er some seaman’s grave,</line>
      <line>And fiery darts at intervals</line>
      <line>Flew up all sparkling from the main,</line>
      <line>As if each star that nightly falls</line>
      <line> Were shooting back to heaven again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My signal-lights! I must away –</line>
      <line>Both, both, are ruined if I stay.</line>
      <line>Farewell, sweet life – thou clingst in vain –</line>
      <line>Now, Vengeance, I am thine again !’</line>
      <line>Fiercely he broke away, nor stopped,</line>
      <line>Nor looked, but from the lattice dropped</line>
      <line>Down mid the pointed crags beneath,</line>
      <line>As if he fled from life to death –</line>
      <line>While pale and mute young Hinda stood,</line>
      <line> Nor moved, till in the silent flood</line>
      <line>A momentary plunge below</line>
      <line>Startled her from her trance of woe.</line>
      <line>Shrieking, she to the lattice flew:</line>
      <line>‘I come, I come – if in that tide</line>
      <line>Thou sleepst tonight, I’ll sleep there too,</line>
      <line>In death’s cold wedlock by thy side.</line>
      <line>Oh, I would ask no happier bed</line>
      <line>Than the chill wave my love lies under –</line>
      <line>Sweeter to rest together dead,</line>
      <line> Far sweeter, than to live asunder!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But no, their hour is not yet come:</line>
      <line>Again she sees his pinnace fly,</line>
      <line>Wafting him fleetly to his home</line>
      <line>(Where’er that ill-starred home may lie),</line>
      <line>And calm and smooth it seemed to win</line>
      <line>Its moonlight way before the wind,</line>
      <line>As if it bore all peace within</line>
      <line>Nor left one breaking heart behind!</line>

    <title>The Eve of St Agnes</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>St. Agnes’ Eve – ah, bitter chill it was!</line>
      <line>The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;</line>
      <line>The hare limped trembling through the frozen grass,</line>
      <line>And silent was the flock in woolly fold;</line>
      <line> Numb were the Beadsman’s fingers, while he told</line>
      <line>His rosary, and while his frosted breath,</line>
      <line>Like pious incense from a censer old,</line>
      <line>Seemed taking flight for Heaven, without a death,</line>
      <line>Past the sweet Virgin’s picture, while his prayer he saith.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His prayer he saith, this patient holy man;</line>
      <line>Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,</line>
      <line>And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,</line>
      <line>Along the chapel-aisle by slow degrees.</line>
      <line>The sculptured dead, on each side, seem to freeze,</line>
      <line> Imprisoned in black, purgatorial rails:</line>
      <line>Knights, ladies, praying in dumb oratories,</line>
      <line>He passeth by, and his weak spirit fails</line>
      <line>To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Northward he turneth through a little door,</line>
      <line>And scarce three steps, ere music’s golden tongue</line>
      <line>Flattered to tears this agéd man and poor;</line>
      <line>But no – already had his deathbell rung;</line>
      <line>The joys of all his life were said and sung –</line>
      <line>His was harsh penance on St Agnes’ Eve!</line>
      <line> Another way he went, and soon among</line>
      <line>Rough ashes sat he for his soul’s reprieve,</line>
      <line>And all night kept awake, for sinners’ sake to grieve.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft –</line>
      <line>And so it chanced, for many a door was wide</line>
      <line>From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft,</line>
      <line>The silver snarling trumpets gan to chide;</line>
      <line>The level chambers, ready with their pride,</line>
      <line>Were glowing to receive a thousand guests;</line>
      <line>The carvéd angels, ever eager-eyed,</line>
      <line> Stared, where upon their heads the cornice rests,</line>
      <line>With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length burst in the argent revelry,</line>
      <line>With plume, tiara, and all rich array,</line>
      <line>Numerous as shadows haunting fairily</line>
      <line>The brain, new stuffed in youth with triumphs gay</line>
      <line>Of old romance. These let us wish away,</line>
      <line>And turn, sole-thoughted, to one lady there,</line>
      <line>Whose heart had brooded all that wintry day</line>
      <line>On love, and winged St Agnes’ saintly care –</line>
      <line> As she had heard old dames full many times declare.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They told her how upon St Agnes’ Eve</line>
      <line>Young virgins might have visions of delight,</line>
      <line>And soft adorings from their loves receive</line>
      <line>Upon the honeyed middle of the night,</line>
      <line>If ceremonies due they did aright –</line>
      <line>As, supperless to bed they must retire,</line>
      <line>And couch supine their beauties, lily white;</line>
      <line>Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require</line>
      <line>Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline:</line>
      <line>The music, yearning like a god in pain,</line>
      <line>She scarcely heard; her maiden eyes divine,</line>
      <line>Fixed on the floor, saw many a sweeping train</line>
      <line>Pass by – she heeded not at all. In vain</line>
      <line>Came many a tiptoe amorous cavalier,</line>
      <line>And back retired – not cooled by high disdain,</line>
      <line>But she saw not. Her heart was otherwhere:</line>
      <line>She sighed for Agnes’ dreams, the sweetest of the year.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She danced along with vague regardless eyes,</line>
      <line> Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short.</line>
      <line>The hallowed hour was near at hand – she sighs</line>
      <line>Amid the timbrels, and the thronged resort</line>
      <line>Of whisperers in anger, or in sport,</line>
      <line>Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn,</line>
      <line>Hoodwinked with faery fancy – all amort,</line>
      <line>Save to St Agnes and her lambs unshorn,</line>
      <line>And all the bliss to be before tomorrow morn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, purposing each moment to retire,</line>
      <line>She lingered still. Meantime, across the moors</line>
      <line> Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire</line>
      <line>For Madeline. Beside the portal-doors,</line>
      <line>Buttressed from moonlight, stands he and implores</line>
      <line>All saints to give him sight of Madeline</line>
      <line>But for one moment in the tedious hours,</line>
      <line>That he might gaze and worship all unseen –</line>
      <line>Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss! In sooth such things have been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He ventures in! Let no buzzed whisper tell –</line>
      <line>All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords</line>
      <line>Will storm his heart, love’s feverous citadel.</line>
      <line> For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,</line>
      <line>Hyena foemen and hot-blooded lords,</line>
      <line>Whose very dogs would execrations howl</line>
      <line>Against his lineage. Not one breast affords</line>
      <line>Him any mercy in that mansion foul,</line>
      <line>Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, happy chance – the agéd creature came,</line>
      <line>Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,</line>
      <line>To where he stood, hid from the torch’s flame</line>
      <line>Behind a broad hall-pillar, far beyond</line>
      <line> The sound of merriment and chorus bland.</line>
      <line>He startled her; but soon she knew his face</line>
      <line>And grasped his fingers in her palsied hand,</line>
      <line>Saying, ‘Mercy, Porphyro! Hie thee from this place –</line>
      <line>They are all here to-night, the whole bloodthirsty race!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Get hence! Get hence! There’s dwarfish Hildebrand;</line>
      <line>He had a fever late, and in the fit</line>
      <line>He curséd thee and thine, both house and land –</line>
      <line>Then there’s that old Lord Maurice, not a whit</line>
      <line>More tame for his grey hairs! Alas me, flit!</line>
      <line>Flit like a ghost away!’ ‘Ah, Gossip dear,</line>
      <line>We’re safe enough – here in this armchair sit,</line>
      <line>And tell me how –’ ‘Good saints not here, not here!</line>
      <line>Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He followed through a lowly archéd way,</line>
      <line>O Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,</line>
      <line>And as she muttered, ‘Well-a – well-a-day!’</line>
      <line>He found him in a little moonlight room,</line>
      <line>Pale, latticed, chill, and silent as a tomb.</line>
      <line>‘Now tell me where is Madeline’, said he,</line>
      <line> ‘Oh tell me, Angela, by the holy loom</line>
      <line>Which none but secret sisterhood may see,</line>
      <line>When they St Agnes’ wool are weaving piously.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘St Agnes? Ah, it is St Agnes’ Eve –</line>
      <line>Yet men will murder upon holy days:</line>
      <line>Thou must hold water in a witch’s sieve,</line>
      <line>And be liege-lord of all the elves and fays,</line>
      <line>To venture so! It fills me with amaze</line>
      <line>To see thee, Porphyro! St Agnes’ Eve!</line>
      <line>God’s help! My lady fair the conjuror plays</line>
      <line> This very night – good angels her deceive!</line>
      <line>But let me laugh awhile, I’ve mickle time to grieve.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,</line>
      <line>While Porphyro upon her face doth look,</line>
      <line>Like puzzled urchin on an agéd crone</line>
      <line>Who keepeth closed a wondrous riddle-book,</line>
      <line>As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.</line>
      <line>But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told</line>
      <line>His lady’s purpose; and he scarce could brook</line>
      <line>Tears at the thought of those enchantments cold,</line>
      <line> And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,</line>
      <line>Flushing his brow, and in his painéd heart</line>
      <line>Made purple riot. Then doth he propose</line>
      <line>A stratagem that makes the beldame start:</line>
      <line>‘A cruel man and impious thou art!</line>
      <line>Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream</line>
      <line>Alone with her good angels, far apart</line>
      <line>From wicked men like thee. Go, go! – I deem</line>
      <line>Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘I will not harm her, by all saints I swear’,</line>
      <line>Quoth Porphyro. ‘Oh may I ne’er find grace</line>
      <line>When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,</line>
      <line>If one of her soft ringlets I displace,</line>
      <line>Or look with ruffian passion in her face!</line>
      <line>Good Angela, believe me by these tears;</line>
      <line>Or I will, even in a moment’s space,</line>
      <line>Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen’s ears,</line>
      <line>And beard them, though they be more fanged than wolves and bears.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Ah, why wilt thou affright a feeble soul –</line>
      <line> A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,</line>
      <line>Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll,</line>
      <line>Whose prayers for thee each morn and evening</line>
      <line>Were never missed?’ Thus plaining, doth she bring</line>
      <line>A gentler speech from burning Porphyro,</line>
      <line>So woeful, and of such deep sorrowing,</line>
      <line>That Angela gives promise she will do</line>
      <line>Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Which was, to lead him in close secrecy</line>
      <line>Even to Madeline’s chamber, and there hide</line>
      <line> Him in a closet of such privacy</line>
      <line>That he might see her beauty unespied,</line>
      <line>And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,</line>
      <line>While legioned fairies paced the coverlet</line>
      <line>And pale enchantment held her sleepy-eyed.</line>
      <line>Never on such a night have lovers met,</line>
      <line>Since Merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘It shall be as thou wishest’, said the dame,</line>
      <line>All cates and dainties shall be storéd there</line>
      <line>Quickly on this feast-night – by the tambour-frame</line>
      <line> Her own lute thou wilt see – no time to spare</line>
      <line>For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare</line>
      <line>On such a catering trust my dizzy head!</line>
      <line>Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer</line>
      <line>The while. Ah! thou must needs the lady wed,</line>
      <line>Or may I never leave my grave among the dead!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.</line>
      <line>The lover’s endless minutes slowly passed;</line>
      <line>The dame returned, and whispered in his ear</line>
      <line>To follow her – with agéd eyes aghast</line>
      <line> From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,</line>
      <line>Through many a dusky gallery, they gain</line>
      <line>The maiden’s chamber, silken, hushed, and chaste;</line>
      <line>Where Porphyro took covert, pleased amain –</line>
      <line>His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her faltering hand upon the balustrade,</line>
      <line>Old Angela was feeling for the stair,</line>
      <line>When Madeline, St Agnes’ charméd maid,</line>
      <line>Rose, like a missioned spirit, unaware.</line>
      <line>With silver taper’s light, and pious care,</line>
      <line> She turned, and down the agéd gossip led</line>
      <line>To a safe level matting. Now prepare,</line>
      <line>Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed –</line>
      <line>She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove frayed and fled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Out went the taper as she hurried in –</line>
      <line>Its little smoke in pallid moonshine died –</line>
      <line>She closed the door, she panted, all akin</line>
      <line>To spirits of the air, and visions wide.</line>
      <line>No uttered syllable (or, woe betide!)</line>
      <line>But to her heart, her heart was voluble,</line>
      <line>Paining with eloquence her balmy side,</line>
      <line>As though a tongueless nightingale should swell</line>
      <line>Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A casement high and triple-arched there was,</line>
      <line>All garlanded with carven imageries</line>
      <line>Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,</line>
      <line>And diamonded with panes of quaint device,</line>
      <line>Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes</line>
      <line>As are the tiger-moth’s deep-damasked wings;</line>
      <line>And in the midst, ’mong thousand heraldries,</line>
      <line> And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings,</line>
      <line>A shielded scutcheon blushed with blood of queens and kings.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,</line>
      <line>And threw warm gules on Madeline’s fair breast</line>
      <line>As down she knelt for Heaven’s grace and boon;</line>
      <line>Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,</line>
      <line>And on her silver cross soft amethyst,</line>
      <line>And on her hair a glory, like a saint:</line>
      <line>She seemed a splendid angel, newly drest,</line>
      <line>Save wings, for Heaven – Porphyro grew faint:</line>
      <line> She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Anon his heart revives. Her vespers done,</line>
      <line>Of all its wreathéd pearls her hair she frees,</line>
      <line>Unclasps her warméd jewels one by one,</line>
      <line>Loosens her fragrant bodice – by degrees</line>
      <line>Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees.</line>
      <line>Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,</line>
      <line>Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,</line>
      <line>In fancy, fair St Agnes in her bed,</line>
      <line>But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,</line>
      <line>In sort of wakeful swoon, perplexed she lay,</line>
      <line>Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressed</line>
      <line>Her soothéd limbs, and soul fatigued away –</line>
      <line>Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;</line>
      <line>Blissfully havened both from joy and pain;</line>
      <line>Clasped like a missal where swart Paynims pray;</line>
      <line>Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain,</line>
      <line>As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Stolen to this paradise, and so entranced,</line>
      <line> Porphyro gazed upon her empty dress</line>
      <line>And listened to her breathing, if it chanced</line>
      <line>To wake into a slumberous tenderness –</line>
      <line>Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,</line>
      <line>And breathed himself; then from the closet crept,</line>
      <line>Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,</line>
      <line>And over the hushed carpet, silent, stepped</line>
      <line>And ’tween the curtains peeped, where, lo – how fast she slept!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then by the bedside, where the faded moon</line>
      <line>Made a dim silver twilight, soft he set</line>
      <line> A table, and, half anguished, threw thereon</line>
      <line>A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet –</line>
      <line>Oh for some drowsy Morphean amulet!</line>
      <line>The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,</line>
      <line>The kettle-drum and far-heard clarionet,</line>
      <line>Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:</line>
      <line>The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And still she slept an azure-liddéd sleep,</line>
      <line>In blanchéd linen, smooth and lavendered,</line>
      <line>While he from forth the closet brought a heap</line>
      <line> Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;</line>
      <line>With jellies soother than the creamy curd,</line>
      <line>And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;</line>
      <line>Manna and dates, in argosy transferred</line>
      <line>From Fez; and spicéd dainties, every one,</line>
      <line>From silken Samarcand to cedared Lebanon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>These delicates he heaped with glowing hand</line>
      <line>On golden dishes and in baskets bright</line>
      <line>Of wreathéd silver – sumptuous they stand</line>
      <line>In the retiréd quiet of the night,</line>
      <line> Filling the chilly room with perfume light:</line>
      <line>‘And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!</line>
      <line>Thou art my Heaven, and I thine eremite!</line>
      <line>Open thine eyes, for meek St Agnes’ sake,</line>
      <line>Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus whispering, his warm, unnervéd arm</line>
      <line>Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream</line>
      <line>By the dusk curtains – ’twas a midnight charm</line>
      <line>Impossible to melt as icéd stream!</line>
      <line>The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;</line>
      <line> Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:</line>
      <line>It seemed he never, never could redeem</line>
      <line>From such a stedfast spell his lady’s eyes,</line>
      <line>So mused awhile, entoiled in wooféd fantasies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Awakening up, he took her hollow lute</line>
      <line>Tumultuous, and, in chords that tenderest be,</line>
      <line>He played an ancient ditty, long since mute,</line>
      <line>In Provence called La Belle Dame Sans Mercy,</line>
      <line>Close to her ear touching the melody.</line>
      <line>Wherewith disturbed, she uttered a soft moan –</line>
      <line> He ceased – she panted quick – and suddenly</line>
      <line>Her blue affrayéd eyes wide open shone:</line>
      <line>Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,</line>
      <line>Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep.</line>
      <line>There was a painful change, that nigh expelled</line>
      <line>The blisses of her dream so pure and deep –</line>
      <line>At which fair Madeline began to weep,</line>
      <line>And moan forth witless words with many a sigh,</line>
      <line>While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;</line>
      <line>Who knelt, with joinéd hands and piteous eye,</line>
      <line>Fearing to move or speak, she looked so dreamingly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Ah, Porphyro!’ said she, ‘but even now</line>
      <line>Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,</line>
      <line>Made tuneable with every sweetest vow,</line>
      <line>And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear.</line>
      <line>How changed thou art! How pallid, chill, and drear!</line>
      <line>Give me that voice again, my Porphyro,</line>
      <line>Those looks immortal, those complainings dear –</line>
      <line>Oh leave me not in this eternal woe,</line>
      <line> For if thou diest, my love, I know not where to go.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beyond a mortal man impassioned far</line>
      <line>At these voluptuous accents, he arose,</line>
      <line>Ethereal, flushed, and, like a throbbing star</line>
      <line>Seen mid the sapphire heaven’s deep repose,</line>
      <line>Into her dream he melted, as the rose</line>
      <line>Blendeth its odour with the violet –</line>
      <line>Solution sweet! Meantime the frost-wind blows</line>
      <line>Like love’s alarum pattering the sharp sleet</line>
      <line>Against the window-panes. St Agnes’ moon hath set.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ’Tis dark – quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:</line>
      <line>‘This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!’</line>
      <line>’Tis dark – the icéd gusts still rave and beat:</line>
      <line>‘No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!</line>
      <line>Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine –</line>
      <line>Cruel! What traitor could thee hither bring?</line>
      <line>I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,</line>
      <line>Though thou forsakest a deceivéd thing,</line>
      <line>A dove forlorn and lost with sick unprunéd wing.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘My Madeline! Sweet dreamer! Lovely bride!</line>
      <line> Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest –</line>
      <line>Thy beauty’s shield, heart-shaped and vermeil dyed?</line>
      <line>Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest</line>
      <line>After so many hours of toil and quest,</line>
      <line>A famished pilgrim saved by miracle!</line>
      <line>Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest,</line>
      <line>Saving of thy sweet self – if thou thinkst well</line>
      <line>To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hark! ’Tis an elfin-storm from faery land,</line>
      <line>Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed!</line>
      <line> Arise, arise! The morning is at hand –</line>
      <line>The bloated wassaillers will never heed –</line>
      <line>Let us away, my love, with happy speed!</line>
      <line>There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,</line>
      <line>Drowned all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead.</line>
      <line>Awake! Arise, my love, and fearless be,</line>
      <line>For o’er the southern moors I have a home for thee!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She hurried at his words, beset with fears,</line>
      <line>For there were sleeping dragons all around,</line>
      <line>At glaring watch, perhaps with ready spears;</line>
      <line> Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.</line>
      <line>In all the house was heard no human sound:</line>
      <line>A chain-drooped lamp was flickering by each door;</line>
      <line>The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,</line>
      <line>Fluttered in the besieging wind’s uproar;</line>
      <line>And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall –</line>
      <line>Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide –</line>
      <line>Where lay the porter, in uneasy sprawl,</line>
      <line>With a huge empty flagon by his side!</line>
      <line> The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,</line>
      <line>But his sagacious eye an inmate owns;</line>
      <line>By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide,</line>
      <line>The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;</line>
      <line>The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans,</line>
    </stanza>

    <title>Juan and Haidee (from Don Jual II-IV)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>How long in his damp trance young Juan lay</line>
      <line>He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,</line>
      <line>And Time had nothing more of night nor day</line>
      <line>For his congealing blood, and senses dim;</line>
      <line> And how this heavy faintness passed away</line>
      <line>He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,</line>
      <line>And tingling vein, seemed throbbing back to life,</line>
      <line>For Death, though vanquished, still retired with strife.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His eyes he opened, shut, again unclosed,</line>
      <line>For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought</line>
      <line>He still was in the boat, and had but dozed,</line>
      <line>And felt again with his despair o’erwrought,</line>
      <line>And wished it death in which he had reposed,</line>
      <line>And then once more his feelings back were brought,</line>
      <line> And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen</line>
      <line>A lovely female face of seventeen.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas bending close o’er his, and the small mouth</line>
      <line>Seemed almost prying into his for breath;</line>
      <line>And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth</line>
      <line>Recalled his answering spirits back from death;</line>
      <line>And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe</line>
      <line>Each pulse to animation, till beneath</line>
      <line>Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh</line>
      <line>To these kind efforts made a low reply.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then was the cordial poured, and mantle flung</line>
      <line>Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm</line>
      <line>Raised higher the faint head which o’er it hung,</line>
      <line>And her transparent cheek (all pure and warm)</line>
      <line>Pillowed his death-like forehead. Then she wrung</line>
      <line>His dewy curls, long drenched by every storm,</line>
      <line>And watched with eagerness each throb that drew</line>
      <line>A sigh from his heaved bosom – and hers, too.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And lifting him with care into the cave,</line>
      <line>The gentle girl, and her attendant (one</line>
      <line> Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,</line>
      <line>And more robust of figure), then begun</line>
      <line>To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave</line>
      <line>Light to the rocks that roofed them, which the sun</line>
      <line>Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe’er</line>
      <line>She was, appeared distinct, and tall, and fair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her brow was overhung with coins of gold</line>
      <line>That sparkled o’er the auburn of her hair –</line>
      <line>Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were rolled</line>
      <line>In braids behind – and though her stature were</line>
      <line> Even of the highest for a female mould,</line>
      <line>They nearly reached her heel; and in her air</line>
      <line>There was a something which bespoke command,</line>
      <line>As one who was a lady in the land…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I’ll tell you who they were, this female pair,</line>
      <line>Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;</line>
      <line>Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air</line>
      <line>Of clap-trap, which your recent poets prize!</line>
      <line>And so, in short, the girls they really were</line>
      <line>They shall appear before your curious eyes –</line>
      <line>Mistress and maid – the first was only daughter</line>
      <line>Of an old man, who lived upon the water.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A fisherman he had been in his youth,</line>
      <line>And still a sort of fisherman was he;</line>
      <line> But other speculations were, in sooth,</line>
      <line>Added to his connection with the sea,</line>
      <line>Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:</line>
      <line>A little smuggling, and some piracy,</line>
      <line>Left him, at last, the sole of many masters</line>
      <line>Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A fisher, therefore, was he – though of men,</line>
      <line>Like Peter the Apostle, – and he fished</line>
      <line>For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,</line>
      <line>And sometimes caught as many as he wished.</line>
      <line>The cargoes he confiscated, and gain</line>
      <line>He sought in the slave-market too, and dished</line>
      <line>Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,</line>
      <line>By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He was a Greek, and on his isle had built</line>
      <line>(One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)</line>
      <line>A very handsome house from out his guilt,</line>
      <line>And there he lived exceedingly at ease;</line>
      <line>Heaven knows what cash he got, or blood he spilt –</line>
      <line>A sad old fellow was he, if you please –</line>
      <line>But this I know, it was a spacious building,</line>
      <line>Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had an only daughter, called Haidee,</line>
      <line>The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;</line>
      <line>Besides, so very beautiful was she,</line>
      <line>Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles!</line>
      <line>Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree,</line>
      <line>She grew to womanhood, and between whiles</line>
      <line>Rejected several suitors, just to learn</line>
      <line>How to accept a better in his turn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And walking out upon the beach, below</line>
      <line>The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,</line>
      <line>Insensible – not dead, but nearly so –</line>
      <line>Don Juan, almost famished, and half drowned;</line>
      <line>But being naked, she was shocked, you know,</line>
      <line>Yet deemed herself in common pity bound,</line>
      <line>As far as in her lay to ‘take him in’ –</line>
      <line>‘A stranger’ dying, with so white a skin!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But taking him into her father’s house</line>
      <line>Was not exactly the best way to save,</line>
      <line>But like conveying to the cat the mouse,</line>
      <line>Or people in a trance into their grave;</line>
      <line>Because the good old man had so much nous</line>
      <line>Unlike the honest arab thieves so brave,</line>
      <line>He would have hospitably cured the stranger,</line>
      <line>And sold him instantly when out of danger.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best –</line>
      <line>A virgin always on her maid relies –</line>
      <line>To place him in the cave for present rest.</line>
      <line>And when, at last, he opened his black eyes</line>
      <line>Their charity increased about their guest,</line>
      <line>And their compassion grew to such a size</line>
      <line>It opened half the turnpike-gates to Heaven</line>
      <line>(St Paul says ’tis the toll which must be given).</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They made a fire, but such a fire as they</line>
      <line>Upon the moment could contrive with such</line>
      <line>Materials as were cast up round the bay –</line>
      <line>Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch</line>
      <line>Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay</line>
      <line>A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch –</line>
      <line>But, by God’s grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,</line>
      <line>That there was fuel to have furnished twenty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,</line>
      <line>For Haidee stripped her sables off to make</line>
      <line>His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,</line>
      <line>And warm, in case by chance he should awake,</line>
      <line>They also gave a petticoat apiece,</line>
      <line>She and her maid, and promised by daybreak</line>
      <line>To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish</line>
      <line>For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus they left him to his lone repose:</line>
      <line>Juan slept like a top – or like the dead,</line>
      <line>Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows) –</line>
      <line>Just for the present, and in his lulled head</line>
      <line>Not even a vision of his former woes</line>
      <line>Throbbed in accurséd dreams, which sometimes spread</line>
      <line>Unwelcome visions of our former years,</line>
      <line>Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Young Juan slept all dreamless – but the maid</line>
      <line>Who smoothed his pillow, as she left the den</line>
      <line>Looked back upon him, and a moment stayed,</line>
      <line>And turned, believing that he called again.</line>
      <line>He slumbered; yet she thought, at least she said</line>
      <line>(The heart will slip even as the tongue and pen),</line>
      <line>He had pronounced her name-but she forgot</line>
      <line>That at this moment Juan knew it not.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And pensive to her father’s house she went,</line>
      <line>Enjoining silence strict to Zoë, who</line>
      <line>Better than her knew what in fact she meant,</line>
      <line>She being wiser by a year or two –</line>
      <line>A year or two’s an age when rightly spent,</line>
      <line>And Zoë spent hers, as most women do,</line>
      <line>In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge</line>
      <line>Which is acquired in Nature’s good old college.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still</line>
      <line>Fast in his cave, and nothing clashed upon</line>
      <line>His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,</line>
      <line>And the young beams of the excluded sun,</line>
      <line>Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;</line>
      <line>And need he had of slumber yet, for none</line>
      <line>Had suffered more – his hardships were comparative</line>
      <line>To those related in my grand-dad’s Narrative.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not so Haidee; she sadly tossed and tumbled,</line>
      <line>And started from her sleep, and, turning o’er,</line>
      <line>Dreamed of a thousand wrecks, o’er which she stumbled,</line>
      <line>And handsome corpses strewed upon the shore;</line>
      <line>And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,</line>
      <line>And called her father’s old slaves up, who swore</line>
      <line>In several oaths – Armenian, Turk, and Greek –</line>
      <line>They knew not what to think of such a freak.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But up she got, and up she made them get,</line>
      <line>With some pretence about the sun, that makes</line>
      <line>Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set –</line>
      <line>And ’tis, no doubt, a sight to see, when breaks</line>
      <line>Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet</line>
      <line>With mist and every bird with him awakes,</line>
      <line>And night is flung off like a mourning-suit</line>
      <line>Worn for a husband, or some other brute.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,</line>
      <line>I’ve seen him rise full oft, indeed of late</line>
      <line> I have sat up on purpose all the night,</line>
      <line>Which hastens, as physicians say, one’s fate –</line>
      <line>And so all ye, who would be in the right</line>
      <line>In health and purse, begin your day to date</line>
      <line>From daybreak, and when coffined at fourscore,</line>
      <line>Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Haidee met the morning face to face!</line>
      <line>Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush</line>
      <line>Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race</line>
      <line>From heart to cheek is curbed into a blush,</line>
      <line> Like to a torrent which a mountain’s base,</line>
      <line>That overpowers some alpine river’s rush,</line>
      <line>Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread –</line>
      <line>Or the Red Sea (but the sea is not red).</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And down the cliff the island virgin came,</line>
      <line>And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,</line>
      <line>While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,</line>
      <line>And young Aurora kissed her lips with dew,</line>
      <line>Taking her for a sister – just the same</line>
      <line>Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,</line>
      <line> Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,</line>
      <line>Had all the advantage too of not being air.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when into the cavern Haidee stepped</line>
      <line>All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw</line>
      <line>That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;</line>
      <line>And then she stopped, and stood as if in awe</line>
      <line>(For sleep is awful) and on tiptoe crept</line>
      <line>And wrapped him closer, lest the air, too raw,</line>
      <line>Should reach his blood – then o’er him still as death</line>
      <line>Bent, with hushed lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And thus like to an angel o’er the dying</line>
      <line>Who die in righteousness, she leaned; and there</line>
      <line>All tranquilly the shipwrecked boy was lying,</line>
      <line>As o’er him lay the calm and stirless air;</line>
      <line>But Zoë the meantime some eggs was frying,</line>
      <line>Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair</line>
      <line>Must breakfast, and betimes-lest they should ask it,</line>
      <line>She drew out her provision from the basket.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She knew that the best feelings must have victual,</line>
      <line>And that a shipwrecked youth would hungry be;</line>
      <line> Besides, being less in love, she yawned a little,</line>
      <line>And felt her veins chilled by the neighbouring sea;</line>
      <line>And so, she cooked their breakfast to a tittle;</line>
      <line>I can’t say that she gave them any tea,</line>
      <line>But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,</line>
      <line>With Scio wine – and all for love, not money!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Zoë, when the eggs were ready, and</line>
      <line>The coffee made, would fain have wakened Juan;</line>
      <line>But Haidee stopped her with her quick small hand,</line>
      <line>And without word, a sign her finger drew on</line>
      <line> Her lip, which Zoë needs must understand,</line>
      <line>And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,</line>
      <line>Because her mistress would not let her break</line>
      <line>That sleep which seemed as it would ne’er awake.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek</line>
      <line>A purple hectic played like dying day</line>
      <line>On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak</line>
      <line>Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,</line>
      <line>Where the blue veins looked shadowy, shrunk and weak;</line>
      <line>And his black curls were dewy with the spray</line>
      <line> Which weighed upon them yet, all damp and salt,</line>
      <line>Mixed with the stony vapours of the vault.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And she bent o’er him, and he lay beneath</line>
      <line>Hushed as the babe upon its mother’s breast,</line>
      <line>Drooped as the willow when no winds can breathe,</line>
      <line>Lulled like the depth of ocean when at rest,</line>
      <line>Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,</line>
      <line>Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest –</line>
      <line>In short, he was a very pretty fellow,</line>
      <line>Although his woes had turned him rather yellow!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,</line>
      <line>But the fair face which met his eyes forbade</line>
      <line>Those eyes to close (though weariness and pain</line>
      <line>Had further sleep a further pleasure made),</line>
      <line>For woman’s face was never formed in vain</line>
      <line>For Juan, so that even when he prayed</line>
      <line>He turned from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,</line>
      <line>To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus upon his elbow he arose</line>
      <line>And looked upon the lady, in whose cheek</line>
      <line> The pale contended with the purple rose,</line>
      <line>As with an effort she began to speak –</line>
      <line>Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,</line>
      <line>Although she told him, in good modern Greek,</line>
      <line>With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,</line>
      <line>That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And every day by daybreak – rather early</line>
      <line>For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest –</line>
      <line>She came into the cave, but it was merely</line>
      <line>To see her bird reposing in his nest;</line>
      <line>And she would softly stir his locks so curly,</line>
      <line>Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,</line>
      <line>Breathing all gently o’er his cheek and mouth,</line>
      <line>As o’er a bed of roses the sweet south.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And every morn his colour freshlier came,</line>
      <line>And every day helped on his convalescence.</line>
      <line>’Twas well, because health in the human frame</line>
      <line>Is pleasant, besides being true love’s essence,</line>
      <line>For health and idleness to passion’s flame</line>
      <line>Are oil and gunpowder – and some good lessons</line>
      <line>Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,</line>
      <line>Without whom Venus will not long attack us.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While Venus fills the heart (without heart really</line>
      <line>Love, though good always, is not quite so good)</line>
      <line> Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli –</line>
      <line>For love must be sustained like flesh and blood –</line>
      <line>While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:</line>
      <line>Eggs, oysters too, are amatory food;</line>
      <line>But who is their purveyor from above</line>
      <line>Heaven knows – it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When Juan woke he found some good things ready:</line>
      <line>A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes</line>
      <line>That ever made a youthful heart less steady –</line>
      <line>Besides her maid’s, as pretty for their size –</line>
      <line> But I have spoken of all this already</line>
      <line>(And repetition’s tiresome and unwise),</line>
      <line>Well – Juan, after bathing in the sea,</line>
      <line>Came always back to coffee and Haidee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Both were so young, and one so innocent,</line>
      <line>That bathing passed for nothing: Juan seemed</line>
      <line>To her (as ’twere) the kind of being sent,</line>
      <line>Of whom these two years she had nightly dreamed,</line>
      <line>A something to be loved, a creature meant</line>
      <line>To be her happiness, and whom she deemed</line>
      <line> To render happy. All who joy would win,</line>
      <line>Must share it – happiness was born a twin!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was such pleasure to behold him, such</line>
      <line>Enlargement of existence to partake</line>
      <line>Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,</line>
      <line>To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake.</line>
      <line>To live with him for ever were too much;</line>
      <line>But then the thought of parting made her quake!</line>
      <line>He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast</line>
      <line>Like a rich wreck – her first love, and her last.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And thus a moon rolled on, and fair Haidee</line>
      <line>Paid daily visits to her boy, and took</line>
      <line>Such plentiful precautions, that still he</line>
      <line>Remained unknown within his craggy nook;</line>
      <line>At last her father’s prows put out to sea,</line>
      <line>For certain merchantmen upon the look,</line>
      <line>Not as of yore to carry off an Io,</line>
      <line>But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.</line>

      <line>Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,</line>
      <line>So that, her father being at sea, she was</line>
      <line> Free as a married woman, or such other</line>
      <line>Female, as where she likes may freely pass,</line>
      <line>Without even the incumbrance of a brother –</line>
      <line>The freest she that ever gazed on glass</line>

      <line>Now she prolonged her visits and her talk</line>
      <line>(For they must talk), and he had learnt to say</line>
      <line>So much as to propose to take a walk –</line>
      <line>For little had he wandered since the day</line>
      <line>On which, like a young flower snapped from the stalk,</line>
      <line>Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay –</line>
      <line>And thus they walked out in the afternoon,</line>
      <line>And saw the sun set opposite the moon…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They looked up to the sky, whose floating glow</line>
      <line>Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;</line>
      <line> They gazed upon the glittering sea below,</line>
      <line>Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;</line>
      <line>They heard the wave’s splash, and the wind so low,</line>
      <line>And saw each other’s dark eyes darting light</line>
      <line>Into each other, and, beholding this,</line>
      <line>Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth and love</line>
      <line>And beauty, all concentrating like rays</line>
      <line>Into one focus, kindled from above –</line>
      <line>Such kisses as belong to early days,</line>
      <line> Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,</line>
      <line>And the blood’s lava, and the pulse a blaze,</line>
      <line>Each kiss a heart-quake (for a kiss’s strength,</line>
      <line>I think, it must be reckoned by its length).</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By length I mean duration; theirs endured</line>
      <line>Heaven knows how long – no doubt they never reckoned;</line>
      <line>And if they had, they could not have secured</line>
      <line>The sum of their sensations to a second.</line>
      <line>They had not spoken; but they felt allured,</line>
      <line>As if their souls and lips each other beckoned,</line>
      <line> Which, being joined, like swarming bees they clung –</line>
      <line>Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They were alone, but not alone as they</line>
      <line>Who shut in chambers think it loneliness:</line>
      <line>The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,</line>
      <line>The twilight glow, which momently grew less,</line>
      <line>The voiceless sands, and dropping caves, that lay</line>
      <line>Around them, made them to each other press,</line>
      <line>As if there were no life beneath the sky</line>
      <line>Save theirs, and that their life could never die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They feared no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,</line>
      <line>They felt no terrors from the night, they were</line>
      <line>All in all to each other: though their speech</line>
      <line>Was broken words, they thought a language there –</line>
      <line>And all the burning tongues the passions teach</line>
      <line>Found in one sigh the best interpreter</line>
      <line>Of Nature’s oracle – first love – that all</line>
      <line>Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Haidee spoke not of scruples, asked no vows,</line>
      <line>Nor offered any; she had never heard</line>
      <line> Of plight and promises to be a spouse,</line>
      <line>Or perils by a loving maid incurred;</line>
      <line>She was all which pure ignorance allows,</line>
      <line>And flew to her young mate like a young bird –</line>
      <line>And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she</line>
      <line>Had not one word to say of constancy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She loved, and was beloved – she adored,</line>
      <line>And she was worshipped; after Nature’s fashion</line>
      <line>Their intense souls, into each other poured,</line>
      <line>If souls could die, had perished in that passion;</line>
      <line> But by degrees their senses were restored,</line>
      <line>Again to be o’ercome, again to dash on –</line>
      <line>And, beating ’gainst his bosom, Haidee’s heart</line>
      <line>Felt as if never more to beat apart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,</line>
      <line>So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour</line>
      <line>Was that in which the heart is always full,</line>
      <line>And, having o’er itself no further power,</line>
      <line>Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,</line>
      <line>But pays off moments in an endless shower</line>
      <line> Of hell-fire – all prepared for people giving</line>
      <line>Pleasure or pain to one another living.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were</line>
      <line>So loving and so lovely – till then never,</line>
      <line>Excepting our first parents, such a pair</line>
      <line>Had run the risk of being damned for ever;</line>
      <line>And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,</line>
      <line>Had, doubtless heard about the Stygian river,</line>
      <line>And Hell and Purgatory – but forgot</line>
      <line>Just in the very crisis she should not.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> They look upon each other, and their eyes</line>
      <line>Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps</line>
      <line>Round Juan’s head, and his around hers lies</line>
      <line>Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;</line>
      <line>She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,</line>
      <line>He hers, until they end in broken gasps;</line>
      <line>And thus they form a group that’s quite antique,</line>
      <line>Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when those deep and burning moments passed,</line>
      <line>And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,</line>
      <line> She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,</line>
      <line>Sustained his head upon her bosom’s charms;</line>
      <line>And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,</line>
      <line>And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,</line>
      <line>Pillowed on her o’erflowing heart, which pants</line>
      <line>With all it granted, and with all it grants…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Haidee and Juan were not married, but</line>
      <line>The fault was theirs, not mine. It is not fair,</line>
      <line>Chaste reader, then, in any way to put</line>
      <line>The blame on me, unless you wish they were –</line>
      <line>Then, if you’d have them wedded, please to shut</line>
      <line>The book which treats of this erroneous pair,</line>
      <line> Before the consequences grow too awful!</line>
      <line>’Tis dangerous to read of loves unlawful.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet they were happy, happy in the illicit</line>
      <line>Indulgence of their innocent desires;</line>
      <line>But more imprudent grown with every visit,</line>
      <line>Haidee forgot the island was her sire’s</line>
      <line>(When we have what we like, ’tis hard to miss it,</line>
      <line>At least in the beginning, ere one tires),</line>
      <line>Thus she came often, not a moment losing,</line>
      <line>Whilst her piratical papa was cruising…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now pillowed cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,</line>
      <line>Haidee and Juan their siesta took,</line>
      <line>A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,</line>
      <line>For ever and anon a something shook</line>
      <line>Juan, and shuddering o’er his frame would creep;</line>
      <line>And Haidee’s sweet lips murmured like a brook</line>
      <line>A wordless music, and her face so fair</line>
      <line>Stirred with her dream as rose-leaves with the air;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or as the stirring of a deep clear stream</line>
      <line>Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind</line>
      <line> Walks o’er it, was she shaken by the dream,</line>
      <line>The mystical usurper of the mind –</line>
      <line>O’erpowering us to be whate’er may seem</line>
      <line>Good to the soul which we no more can bind.</line>
      <line>Strange state of being (for ’tis still to be),</line>
      <line>Senseless to feel, and with sealed eyes to see!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She dreamed of being alone on the sea-shore,</line>
      <line>Chained to a rock; she knew not how, but stir</line>
      <line>She could not from the spot, and the loud roar</line>
      <line>Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;</line>
      <line> And o’er her upper lip they seemed to pour</line>
      <line>Until she sobbed for breath, and soon they were</line>
      <line>Foaming o’er her lone head, so fierce and high</line>
      <line>Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Anon she was released, and then she strayed</line>
      <line>O’er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,</line>
      <line>And stumbled almost every step she made;</line>
      <line>And something rolled before her in a sheet,</line>
      <line>Which she must still pursue howe’er afraid –</line>
      <line>’Twas white and indistinct, nor stopped to meet</line>
      <line> Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed and grasped</line>
      <line>And ran, but it escaped her as she clasped.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The dream changed: in a cave she stood, its walls</line>
      <line>Were hung with marble icicles (the work</line>
      <line>Of ages on its water-fretted halls,</line>
      <line>Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk),</line>
      <line>Her hair was dripping, and the very balls</line>
      <line>Of her black eyes seemed turned to tears, and murk</line>
      <line>The sharp rocks looked below each drop they caught,</line>
      <line>Which froze to marble as it fell, she thought.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,</line>
      <line>Pale as the foam that frothed on his dead brow,</line>
      <line>Which she essayed in vain to clear (how sweet</line>
      <line>Were once her cares, how idle seemed they now!)</line>
      <line>Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat</line>
      <line>Of his quenched heart; and the sea dirges low</line>
      <line>Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid’s song –</line>
      <line>And that brief dream appeared a life too long.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And gazing on the dead, she thought his face</line>
      <line>Faded, or altered into something new,</line>
      <line> Like to her father’s features, till each trace</line>
      <line>More like and like to Lambro’s aspect grew,</line>
      <line>With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace –</line>
      <line>And starting, she awoke. And what to view?</line>
      <line>Oh, Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?</line>
      <line>’Tis – ’tis her father’s – fixed upon the pair!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then shrieking she arose, and shrieking fell,</line>
      <line>With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see</line>
      <line>Him whom she deemed a habitant where dwell</line>
      <line>The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be</line>
      <line> Perchance the death of one she loved too well:</line>
      <line>Dear as her father had been to Haidee,</line>
      <line>It was a moment of that awful kind –</line>
      <line>I have seen such, but must not call to mind!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Up Juan sprung to Haidee’s bitter shriek,</line>
      <line>And caught her falling, and from off the wall</line>
      <line>Snatched down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak</line>
      <line>Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:</line>
      <line>Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,</line>
      <line>Smiled scornfully, and said, ‘Within my call,</line>
      <line> A thousand scimitars await the word –</line>
      <line>Put up, young man, put up your silly sword!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Haidee clung around him: ‘Juan, ’tis –</line>
      <line>’Tis Lambro – ’tis my father! Kneel with me –</line>
      <line>He will forgive us – yes – it must be – yes!</line>
      <line>Oh dearest father! in this agony</line>
      <line>Of pleasure and of pain – even while I kiss</line>
      <line>Thy garment’s hem with transport, can it be</line>
      <line>That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?</line>
      <line>Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>High and inscrutable the old man stood,</line>
      <line>Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye</line>
      <line>(Not always signs with him of calmest mood);</line>
      <line>He looked upon her, but gave no reply,</line>
      <line>Then turned to Juan, in whose cheek the blood</line>
      <line>Oft came and went, as there resolved to die –</line>
      <line>In arms at least he stood, in act to spring</line>
      <line>On the first foe whom Lambro’s call might bring.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Young man, your sword!’ so Lambro once more said:</line>
      <line>Juan replied, ‘Not while this arm is free!’</line>
      <line> The old man’s cheek grew pale, but not with dread,</line>
      <line>And drawing from his belt a pistol, he</line>
      <line>Replied, ‘Your blood be then on your own head!’</line>
      <line>Then looked close at the flint, as if to see</line>
      <line>’Twas fresh (for he had lately used the lock),</line>
      <line>And next proceeded quietly to cock.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,</line>
      <line>That cocking of a pistol, when you know</line>
      <line>A moment more will bring the sight to bear</line>
      <line>Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so</line>
      <line> (A gentlemanly distance, not too near,</line>
      <line>If you have got a former friend for foe),</line>
      <line>But after being fired at once or twice,</line>
      <line>The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lambro presented, and one instant more</line>
      <line>Had stopped this Canto, and Don Juan’s breath,</line>
      <line>When Haidee threw herself her boy before;</line>
      <line>Stern as her sire, ‘On me’, she cried, ‘let death</line>
      <line>Descend! The fault is mine. This fatal shore</line>
      <line>He found – but sought not. I have pledged my faith;</line>
      <line> I love him – I will die with him. I knew</line>
      <line>Your nature’s firmness – know your daughter’s too!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A minute past, and she had been all tears,</line>
      <line>And tenderness, and infancy; but now</line>
      <line>She stood as one who championed human fears –</line>
      <line>Pale, statue-like, and stern, she wooed the blow;</line>
      <line>And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,</line>
      <line>She drew up to her height, as if to show</line>
      <line>A fairer mark, and with a fixed eye scanned</line>
      <line>Her father’s face – but never stopped his hand!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He gazed on her, and she on him – ’twas strange</line>
      <line>How like they looked! The expression was the same:</line>
      <line>Serenely savage, with a little change</line>
      <line>In the large dark eye’s mutual-darted flame;</line>
      <line>For she too was as one who could avenge,</line>
      <line>If cause should be – a lioness, though tame!</line>
      <line>Her father’s blood before her father’s face</line>
      <line>Boiled up, and proved her truly of his race.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I said they were alike, their features and</line>
      <line>Their stature differing but in sex and years;</line>
      <line> Even to the delicacy of their hand</line>
      <line>There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;</line>
      <line>And now to see them, thus divided, stand</line>
      <line>In fixed ferocity (when joyous tears,</line>
      <line>And sweet sensations, should have welcomed both)</line>
      <line>Shows what the passions are in their full growth!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The father paused a moment, then withdrew</line>
      <line>His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,</line>
      <line>And looking on her, as to look her through,</line>
      <line>‘Not I’, he said, ‘have sought this stranger’s ill –</line>
      <line> Not I have made this desolation. Few</line>
      <line>Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill –</line>
      <line>But I must do my duty. How thou hast</line>
      <line>Done thine, the present vouches for the past!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Let him disarm; or, by my father’s head,</line>
      <line>His own shall roll before you like a ball!’</line>
      <line>He raised his whistle, as the word he said,</line>
      <line>And blew; another answered to the call,</line>
      <line>And, rushing in, disorderly, though led</line>
      <line>(And armed from boot to turban, one and all),</line>
      <line> Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank.</line>
      <line>He gave the word, ‘Arrest or slay the Frank!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew</line>
      <line>His daughter; while compressed within his clasp,</line>
      <line>’Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew –</line>
      <line>In vain she struggled in her father’s grasp,</line>
      <line>His arms were like a serpent’s coil! Then flew</line>
      <line>Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,</line>
      <line>The file of pirates – save the foremost, who</line>
      <line>Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The second had his cheek laid open; but</line>
      <line>The third (a wary, cool old sworder) took</line>
      <line>The blows upon his cutlass, and then put</line>
      <line>His own well in – so well, ere you could look,</line>
      <line>His man was floored, and helpless at his foot,</line>
      <line>With the blood running like a little brook</line>
      <line>From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red,</line>
      <line>One on the arm, the other on the head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then they bound him where he fell, and bore</line>
      <line>Juan from the apartment: with a sign</line>
      <line> Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,</line>
      <line>Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.</line>
      <line>They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar</line>
      <line>Until they reached some galliots, placed in line;</line>
      <line>On board of one of these, and under hatches,</line>
      <line>They stowed him, with strict orders to the watches.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The world is full of strange vicissitudes,</line>
      <line>And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:</line>
      <line>A gentleman, so rich in the world’s goods,</line>
      <line>Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,</line>
      <line>Just at the very time when he least broods</line>
      <line>On such a thing, is suddenly to sea sent,</line>
      <line>Wounded and chained, so that he cannot move –</line>
      <line>And all because a lady fell in love!…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The last sight which she saw was Juan’s gore,</line>
      <line>And he himself o’ermastered and cut down</line>
      <line>(His blood was running on the very floor</line>
      <line>Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own) –</line>
      <line>Thus much she viewed an instant and no more –</line>
      <line>Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan.</line>
      <line>On her sire’s arm, which until now scarce held</line>
      <line>Her writhing, fell she like a cedar felled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A vein had burst, and her sweet lips’ pure dyes</line>
      <line>Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o’er;</line>
      <line>And her head drooped as when the lily lies</line>
      <line>O’ercharged with rain. Her summoned handmaids bore</line>
      <line>Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;</line>
      <line>Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,</line>
      <line>But she defied all means they could employ,</line>
      <line>Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Days lay she in that state unchanged (though chill,</line>
      <line>With nothing livid – still her lips were red);</line>
      <line> She had no pulse, but death seemed absent still.</line>
      <line>No hideous sign proclaimed her surely dead –</line>
      <line>Corruption came not, in each mind to kill</line>
      <line>All hope – to look upon her sweet face bred</line>
      <line>New thoughts of life, for it seemed full of soul:</line>
      <line>She had so much, earth could not claim the whole…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Twelve days and nights she withered thus. At last,</line>
      <line>Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show</line>
      <line>A parting pang, the spirit from her past;</line>
      <line>And they who watched her nearest could not know</line>
      <line>The very instant, till the change that cast</line>
      <line>Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,</line>
      <line>Glazed o’er her eyes – the beautiful, the black –</line>
      <line>Oh, to possess such lustre – and then lack!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She died, but not alone: she held within</line>
      <line>A second principle of life, which might</line>
      <line> Have dawned a fair and sinless child of sin,</line>
      <line>But closed its little being without light,</line>
      <line>And went down to the grave unborn, wherein</line>
      <line>Blossom and bough lie withered with one blight;</line>
      <line>In vain the dews of heaven descend above</line>
      <line>The bleeding flower, and blasted fruit, of love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus lived, thus died, she. Never more on her</line>
      <line>Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made</line>
      <line>Through years, or moons, the inner weight to bear</line>
      <line>Which colder hearts endure till they are laid</line>
      <line> By age in earth; her days and pleasures were</line>
      <line>Brief, but delightful – such as had not stayed</line>
      <line>Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well</line>
      <line>By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That isle is now all desolate and bare,</line>
      <line>Its dwellings down, its tenants past away.</line>
      <line>None but her own and father’s grave is there,</line>
      <line>And nothing outward tells of human clay:</line>
      <line>Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair –</line>
      <line>No stone is there to show, no tongue to say,</line>
      <line> What was – no dirge, except the hollow sea’s,</line>
      <line>Mourns o’er the Beauty of the Cyclades.</line>

    <title>The Indian Bride</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>She has lighted her lamp, and crowned it with flowers,</line>
      <line>The sweetest that breathed of the summer hours,</line>
      <line>Red and white roses linked in a band</line>
      <line>Like a maiden’s blush, or a maiden’s hand;</line>
      <line> Jasmines – some like silver spray,</line>
      <line>Some like gold in the morning ray –</line>
      <line>Fragrant stars, and favourites they,</line>
      <line>When Indian girls on a festival-day</line>
      <line>Braid their dark tresses, and all over weaves</line>
      <line>The rosy-bower of lotus leaves –</line>
      <line>Canopy suiting the lamp-lighted bark,</line>
      <line>Love’s own flowers, and Love’s own ark.</line>
      <line>She watched the sky, the sunset grew dim;</line>
      <line>She raised to Camdeo her evening hymn.</line>
      <line> The scent of the night-flowers came on the air;</line>
      <line>And then, like a bird escaped from the snare,</line>
      <line>She flew to the river (no moon was bright,</line>
      <line>But the stars and the fire-flies gave her their light);</line>
      <line>She stood beneath the mangos’ shade,</line>
      <line>Half delighted and half afraid;</line>
      <line>She trimmed her lamp, and breathed on each bloom</line>
      <line>(Oh, that breath was sweeter than all their perfume!)</line>
      <line>Threw spices and oil on the spire of flame,</line>
      <line>Called thrice on her absent lover’s name –</line>
      <line> And every pulse throbbed as she gave</line>
      <line>Her little boat to the Ganges’ wave…</line>
      <line>Zaide watched her flower-built vessel glide,</line>
      <line>Mirrored beneath on the deep-blue tide;</line>
      <line> Lovely and lonely, scented and bright,</line>
      <line>Like Hope’s own bark, all bloom and light.</line>
      <line>There’s not one breath of wind on the air,</line>
      <line>The heavens are cloudless, the waters are fair,</line>
      <line>No dew is falling, yet woe to that shade –</line>
      <line>The maiden is weeping, her lamp has decayed!</line>
      <line>Hark to the ring of the scimitar –</line>
      <line>It tells that the soldier returns from afar.</line>
      <line>Down from the mountains the warriors come:</line>
      <line>Hark to the thunder-roll of the drum!</line>
      <line> To the startling voice of the trumpet’s call!</line>
      <line>To the cymbal’s clash – to the atabal!</line>
      <line>The banners of crimson float in the sun;</line>
      <line>The warfare is ended, the battle is won.</line>
      <line>The mother hath taken the child from her breast</line>
      <line>And raised it to look on its father’s crest.</line>
      <line>The pathway is lined, as the bands pass along,</line>
      <line>With maidens, who meet them with flowers and song.</line>
      <line>And Zaide hath forgotten in Azim’s arms</line>
      <line>All her so false lamp’s falser alarms.</line>
      <line> This looks not a bridal – the singers are mute,</line>
      <line>Still is the mandore, and breathless the lute;</line>
      <line>Yet there the bride sits. Her dark hair is bound,</line>
      <line>And the robe of her marriage floats white on the ground.</line>
      <line>Oh, where is her lover, the bridegroom – oh, where?</line>
      <line>Look under yon black pall – the bridegroom is there!</line>
      <line>Yet the guests are all bidden, the feast is the same,</line>
      <line>The bride plights her troth amid smoke and mid flame!</line>
      <line>They have raised the death-pyre of sweet scented wood,</line>
      <line>And sprinkled it o’er with the sacred flood</line>
      <line> Of the Ganges. The priests are assembled – their song</line>
      <line>Sinks deep on the ear as they bear her along,</line>
      <line>The bride of the dead. Aye, is this not love –</line>
      <line>That one pure, wild feeling all others above,</line>
      <line>Vowed to the living, and kept to the tomb –</line>
      <line>The same in its blight as it was in its bloom!</line>
      <line>With no tear in her eye, and no change in her smile,</line>
      <line>Young Zaide had come nigh to the funeral pile.</line>
      <line>The bells of the dancing ceased from their sound;</line>
      <line>Silent they stood by that holiest mound.</line>
      <line> From a crowd like the sea-waves there came not a breath,</line>
      <line>When the maiden stood by the place of death!</line>
      <line>One moment was given, the last she might spare,</line>
      <line>To the mother who stood in her weeping there.</line>
      <line>She took the jewels that shone on her hand;</line>
      <line>She took from her dark hair its flowery band,</line>
      <line>And scattered them round. At once they raise</line>
      <line>The hymn of rejoicing and love in her praise.</line>
      <line>A prayer is muttered, a blessing said,</line>
      <line>Her torch is raised – she is by the dead.</line>
      <line> She has fired the pile! At once there came</line>
      <line>A mingled rush of smoke and flame,</line>
      <line>Though the wind swept it off. They saw the bride –</line>
      <line>Laid by her Azim, side by side.</line>
      <line>The breeze had spread the long curls of her hair:</line>
      <line>Like a banner of fire they played on the air.</line>
      <line>The smoke and the flame gathered round as before,</line>
      <line>Then cleared – but the bride was seen no more!</line>

    <title>Arabella Stuart</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas but a dream! – I saw the stag leap free</line>
      <line>Under the boughs where early birds were singing,</line>
      <line>I stood o’ershadowed by the greenwood-tree,</line>
      <line>And heard, it seemed, a sudden bugle ringing</line>
      <line> Far through a royal forest: then the fawn</line>
      <line>Shot, like a gleam of light, from grassy lawn</line>
      <line>To secret covert; and the smooth turf shook</line>
      <line>And lilies quivered by the glade’s lone brook,</line>
      <line>And young leaves trembled, as, in fleet career,</line>
      <line>A princely band, with horn, and hound, and spear,</line>
      <line>Like a rich masque swept forth. I saw the dance</line>
      <line>Of their white plumes, that bore a silvery glance</line>
      <line>Into the deep wood’s heart; and all passed by,</line>
      <line>Save one – I met the smile of one clear eye,</line>
      <line> Flashing out joy to mine. Yes, thou wert there.</line>
      <line>Seymour, a soft wind blew the clustering hair</line>
      <line>Back from thy gallant brow, as thou didst rein</line>
      <line>Thy courser, turning from that gorgeous train,</line>
      <line>And fling, methought, thy hunting-spear away,</line>
      <line>And, lightly graceful in thy green array,</line>
      <line>Bound to my side; and we, that met and parted,</line>
      <line>Ever in dread of some dark watchful power,</line>
      <line>Won back to childhood’s trust, and fearless-hearted,</line>
      <line>Blent the glad fullness of our thoughts that hour,</line>
      <line> Even like the mingling of sweet streams, beneath</line>
      <line>Dim woven leaves, and midst the floating breath</line>
      <line>Of hidden forest-flowers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis past! – I wake,</line>
      <line>A captive, and alone, and far from thee,</line>
      <line>My love and friend – yet fostering for thy sake</line>
      <line>A quenchless hope of happiness to be,</line>
      <line>And feeling still my woman-spirit strong,</line>
      <line>In the deep faith which lifts from earthly wrong</line>
      <line>A Heavenward glance. I know, I know our love</line>
      <line>Shall yet call gentle angels from above,</line>
      <line> By its undying fervour, and prevail –</line>
      <line>Sending a breath, as of the spring’s first gale,</line>
      <line>Through hearts now cold; and, raising its bright face</line>
      <line>With a free gush of sunny tears, erase</line>
      <line>The characters of anguish. In this trust</line>
      <line>I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust,</line>
      <line>That I may bring thee back no faded form,</line>
      <line>No bosom chilled and blighted by the storm,</line>
      <line>But all my youth’s first treasures, when we meet,</line>
      <line>Making past sorrow, by communion, sweet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thou too art in bonds! – yet droop thou not,</line>
      <line>Oh my beloved – there is one hopeless lot,</line>
      <line>But one, and that not ours. Beside the dead</line>
      <line>There sits the grief that mantles up its head,</line>
      <line>Loathing the laughter and proud pomp of light,</line>
      <line>When darkness, from the vainly doting sight</line>
      <line>Covers its beautiful! If thou wert gone</line>
      <line>To the grave’s bosom, with thy radiant brow;</line>
      <line>If thy deep-thrilling voice, with that low tone</line>
      <line>Of earnest tenderness, which now, even now</line>
      <line>Seems floating through my soul, were music taken</line>
      <line>For ever from this world – oh! thus forsaken,</line>
      <line>Could I bear on? Thou livest, thou livest, thou’rt mine!</line>
      <line>With this glad thought I make my heart a shrine,</line>
      <line>And by the lamp which quenchless there shall burn,</line>
      <line>Sit a lone watcher for the day’s return.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And lo, the joy that cometh with the morning,</line>
      <line>Brightly victorious o’er the hours of care!</line>
      <line>I have not watched in vain, serenely scorning</line>
      <line>The wild and busy whispers of despair!</line>
      <line>Thou hast sent tidings, as of Heaven – I wait</line>
      <line>The hour, the sign, for blesséd flight to thee.</line>
      <line>Oh for the skylark’s wing that seeks its mate</line>
      <line>As a star shoots! – but on the breezy sea</line>
      <line>We shall meet soon. To think of such an hour!</line>
      <line>Will not my heart, o’erburdened by its bliss,</line>
      <line>Faint and give way within me, as a flower</line>
      <line>Borne down and perishing by noontide’s kiss?</line>
      <line>Yet shall I fear that lot – the perfect rest,</line>
      <line>The full deep joy of dying on thy breast,</line>
      <line> After long suffering won? So rich a close</line>
      <line>Too seldom crowns with peace affection’s woes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sunset! – I tell each moment – from the skies</line>
      <line>The last red splendour floats along my wall,</line>
      <line>Like a king’s banner! Now it melts, it dies!</line>
      <line>I see one star – I hear – ’twas not the call,</line>
      <line>The expected voice; my quick heart throbbed too soon.</line>
      <line>I must keep vigil till yon rising moon</line>
      <line>Shower down less golden light. Beneath her beam</line>
      <line>Through my lone lattice poured, I sit and dream</line>
      <line> Of summer-lands afar, where holy love,</line>
      <line>Under the vine or in the citron grove,</line>
      <line>May breathe from terror.</line>
      <line>Now the night grows deep,</line>
      <line>And silent as its clouds, and full of sleep.</line>
      <line>I hear my veins beat. Hark! a bell’s slow chime!</line>
      <line>My heart strikes with it. Yet again – ’tis time!</line>
      <line>A step! – a voice! – or but a rising breeze?</line>
      <line>Hark! – haste! – I come, to meet thee on the seas.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now never more, oh! never, in the worth</line>
      <line>Of its pure cause, let sorrowing love on earth</line>
      <line> Trust fondly – never more! The hope is crushed</line>
      <line>That lit my life, the voice within me hushed</line>
      <line>That spoke sweet oracles; and I return</line>
      <line>To lay my youth, as in a burial urn,</line>
      <line>Where sunshine may not find it. All is lost!</line>
      <line>No tempest met our barks – no billow tossed –</line>
      <line>Yet were they severed, even as we must be,</line>
      <line>That so have loved, so striven our hearts to free</line>
      <line>From their close-coiling fate! In vain – in vain!</line>
      <line>The dark links meet, and clasp themselves again,</line>
      <line>And press out life. Upon the deck I stood,</line>
      <line>And a white sail came gliding o’er the flood,</line>
      <line>Like some proud bird of ocean; then mine eye</line>
      <line>Strained out, one moment earlier to descry</line>
      <line>The form it ached for, and the bark’s career</line>
      <line>Seemed slow to that fond yearning. It drew near,</line>
      <line>Fraught with our foes! What boots it to recall</line>
      <line>The strife, the tears? Once more a prison-wall</line>
      <line>Shuts the green hills and woodlands from my sight,</line>
      <line>And joyous glance of waters to the light,</line>
      <line> And thee, my Seymour, thee!</line>
      <line>I will not sink!</line>
      <line>Thou, thou hast rent the heavy chain that bound thee!</line>
      <line>And this shall be my strength – the joy to think</line>
      <line>That thou mayst wander with heaven’s breath around thee,</line>
      <line>And all the laughing sky! This thought shall yet</line>
      <line>Shine o’er my heart a radiant amulet,</line>
      <line>Guarding it from despair. Thy bonds are broken,</line>
      <line>And unto me, I know, thy true love’s token</line>
      <line>Shall one day be deliverance, though the years</line>
      <line>Lie dim between, o’erhung with mists of tears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> My friend! my friend! where art thou? Day by day,</line>
      <line>Gliding like some dark mournful stream away,</line>
      <line>My silent youth flows from me. Spring, the while,</line>
      <line>Comes and rains beauty on the kindling boughs</line>
      <line>Round hall and hamlet; Summer with her smile,</line>
      <line>Fills the green forest; young hearts breathe their vows;</line>
      <line>Brothers long parted meet; fair children rise</line>
      <line>Round the glad board; Hope laughs from loving eyes –</line>
      <line>All this is in the world! These joys lie sown,</line>
      <line>The dew of every path. On one alone</line>
      <line> Their freshness may not fall – the stricken deer</line>
      <line>Dying of thirst with all the waters near.</line>

      <line>Ye are (from dingle and fresh glade) ye flowers</line>
      <line>By some kind hand to cheer my dungeon sent;</line>
      <line>O’er you the oak shed down the summer showers,</line>
      <line>And the lark’s nest was where your bright cups bent,</line>
      <line>Quivering to breeze and raindrop, like the sheen</line>
      <line>Of twilight stars. On you heaven’s eye hath been,</line>
      <line>Through the leaves, pouring its dark sultry blue</line>
      <line>Into your glowing hearts; the bee to you</line>
      <line> Hath murmured, and the rill. My soul grows faint</line>
      <line>With passionate yearning, as its quick dreams paint</line>
      <line>Your haunts by dell and stream – the green, the free,</line>
      <line>The full of all sweet sound – the shut from me!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There went a swift bird singing past my cell –</line>
      <line>Oh love and freedom, ye are lovely things!</line>
      <line>With you the peasant on the hills may dwell,</line>
      <line>And by the streams; but I – the blood of kings,</line>
      <line>A proud unmingling river, through my veins</line>
      <line>Flows in lone brightness, and its gifts are chains!</line>
      <line> Kings! – I had silent visions of deep bliss,</line>
      <line>Leaving their thrones far distant, and for this</line>
      <line>I am cast under their triumphal car,</line>
      <line>An insect to be crushed! Oh! Heaven is far –</line>
      <line>Earth pitiless!</line>

      <line>Dost thou forget me, Seymour? I am proved</line>
      <line>So long, so sternly! Seymour, my beloved!</line>
      <line>There are such tales of holy marvels done</line>
      <line>By strong affection, of deliverance won</line>
      <line>Through its prevailing power! Are these things told</line>
      <line> Till the young weep with rapture, and the old</line>
      <line>Wonder, yet dare not doubt; and thou! oh, thou!</line>
      <line>Dost thou forget me in my hope’s decay? –</line>
      <line>Thou canst not! – through the silent night, even now,</line>
      <line>I, that need prayer so much, awake and pray</line>
      <line>Still first for thee. Oh gentle, gentle friend!</line>
      <line>How shall I bear this anguish to the end?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Aid! – comes there yet no aid? The voice of blood</line>
      <line>Passes Heaven’s gate, even ere the crimson flood</line>
      <line>Sinks through the greensward! Is there not a cry</line>
      <line> From the wrung heart, of power, through agony,</line>
      <line>To pierce the clouds? Hear, Mercy! – hear me! None</line>
      <line>That bleed and weep beneath the smiling sun</line>
      <line>Have heavier cause! – yet hear! – my soul grows dark –</line>
      <line>Who hears the last shriek from the sinking bark</line>
      <line>On the mid-seas, and with the storm alone,</line>
      <line>And bearing to the abyss, unseen, unknown,</line>
      <line>Its freight of human hearts? The o’ermastering wave –</line>
      <line>Who shall tell how it rushed – and none to save?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thou hast forsaken me! I feel, I know,</line>
      <line> There would be rescue if this were not so.</line>
      <line>Thou’rt at the chase, thou’rt at the festive board,</line>
      <line>Thou’rt where the red wine free and high is poured,</line>
      <line>Thou’rt where the dancers meet! – a magic glass</line>
      <line>Is set within my soul, and proud shapes pass,</line>
      <line>Flushing it o’er with pomp from bower and hall;</line>
      <line>I see one shadow, stateliest there of all –</line>
      <line>Thine! What dost thou amidst the bright and fair,</line>
      <line>Whispering light words, and mocking my despair?</line>
      <line>It is not well of thee! My love was more</line>
      <line> Than fiery song may breathe, deep thought explore –</line>
      <line>And there thou smilest, while my heart is dying,</line>
      <line>With all its blighted hopes around it lying;</line>
      <line>Even thou, on whom they hung their last green leaf.</line>
      <line>Yet smile, smile on! Too bright art thou for grief.</line>

      <line>Death – what? Is death a locked and treasured thing,</line>
      <line>Guarded by swords of fire – a hidden spring,</line>
      <line>A fabled fruit – that I should thus endure,</line>
      <line>As if the world within me held no cure?</line>
      <line>Wherefore not spread free wings? Heaven, Heaven control</line>
      <line>These thoughts – they rush – I look into my soul</line>
      <line>As down a gulf, and tremble at the array</line>
      <line>Of fierce forms crowding it! Give strength to pray,</line>

      <line>The heart’s great deep, with floods of anguish filled,</line>
      <line>For human line too fearfully profound.</line>
      <line>Therefore forgive, my Father! if thy child,</line>
      <line>Rocked on its heaving darkness, hath grown wild</line>
      <line>And sinned in her despair! It well may be,</line>
      <line> That thou wouldst lead my spirit back to thee –</line>
      <line>By the crushed hope too long on this world poured,</line>
      <line>The stricken love which hath perchance adored</line>
      <line>A mortal in thy place! Now let me strive</line>
      <line>With thy strong arm no more! Forgive, forgive!</line>
      <line>Take me to peace!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And peace at last is nigh.</line>
      <line>A sign is on my brow, a token sent</line>
      <line>The o’erwearied dust from home; no breeze flits by</line>
      <line>But calls me with a strange sweet whisper, blent</line>
      <line>Of many mysteries.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hark! the warning tone</line>
      <line> Deepens – its word is Death! Alone, alone,</line>
      <line>And sad in youth, but chastened, I depart,</line>
      <line>Bowing to Heaven. Yet, yet my woman’s heart</line>
      <line>Shall wake a spirit and a power to bless,</line>
      <line>Even in this hour’s o’ershadowing fearfulness,</line>
      <line>Thee, its first love! Oh! tender still, and true –</line>
      <line>Be it forgotten if mine anguish threw</line>
      <line>Drops from its bitter fountain on thy name,</line>
      <line>Though but a moment.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, with fainting frame,</line>
      <line>With soul just lingering on the flight begun,</line>
      <line> To bind for thee its last dim thoughts in one,</line>
      <line>I bless thee! Peace be on thy noble head,</line>
      <line>Years of bright fame, when I am with the dead!</line>
      <line>I bid this prayer survive me, and retain</line>
      <line>Its might, again to bless thee, and again!</line>
      <line>Thou hast been gathered into my dark fate</line>
      <line>Too much; too long, for my sake, desolate</line>
      <line>Hath been thine exiled youth; but now take back,</line>
      <line>From dying hands, thy freedom, and retrack</line>
      <line>(After a few kind tears for her whose days</line>
      <line> Went out in dreams of thee) the sunny ways</line>
      <line>Of hope, and find thou happiness! Yet send,</line>
      <line>Even then, in silent hours, a thought, dear friend!</line>
      <line>Down to my voiceless chamber; for thy love</line>
      <line>Hath been to me all gifts of earth above,</line>
      <line>Though bought with burning tears! It is the sting</line>
      <line>Of death to leave that vainly-precious thing</line>
      <line>In this cold world! What were it then, if thou,</line>
      <line>With thy fond eyes, wert gazing on me now?</line>
      <line>Too keen a pang! Farewell! and yet once more,</line>
      <line> Farewell! – the passion of long years I pour</line>
      <line>Into that word. Thou hearest not, but the woe</line>
      <line>And fervour of its tones may one day flow</line>
      <line>To thy heart’s holy place – there let them dwell.</line>
      <line>We shall o’ersweep the grave to meet – Farewell!</line>

    <title>The Faithless Knight</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The lady she sat in her bower alone,</line>
      <line>And she gazed from the lattice-window high</line>
      <line>Where a white steed’s hoofs were ringing on,</line>
      <line>With a beating heart, and a smothered sigh.</line>
      <line> Why doth she gaze through the sunset-rays?</line>
      <line>Why doth she watch that white steed’s track,</line>
      <line>While a quivering smile on her red lip plays?</line>
      <line>’Tis her own dear knight – will he not look back?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The steed flew fast, and the rider passed –</line>
      <line>Nor paused he to gaze at the lady’s bower –</line>
      <line>The smile from her lip is gone at last!</line>
      <line>There are tears on her cheek, like the dew on a flower!</line>
      <line>And ‘Plague on these foolish tears’, she said,</line>
      <line>‘Which have dimmed the view of my young love’s track!</line>
      <line> For oh, I am sure, while I bent my head,</line>
      <line>It was then – it was then – that my knight looked back!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On flew that steed with an arrow’s speed –</line>
      <line>He is gone, and the green boughs wave between –</line>
      <line>And she sighs, as the sweet breeze sighs through a reed,</line>
      <line>As she watches the spot where he last has been.</line>
      <line>Oh, many a sun shall rise and set,</line>
      <line>And many an hour may she watch in vain,</line>
      <line>And many a tear shall that soft cheek wet,</line>
      <line>Ere that steed and its rider return again!</line>

    <title>Crazy Kate (Task)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There often wanders one, whom better days</line>
      <line> Saw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed</line>
      <line>With lace, and hat with splendid ribband bound.</line>
      <line>A serving-maid was she, and fell in love</line>
      <line>With one who left her, went to sea and died.</line>
      <line>Her fancy followed him through foaming waves</line>
      <line>To distant shores, and she would sit and weep</line>
      <line>At what a sailor suffers; fancy too,</line>
      <line>Delusive most where warmest wishes are,</line>
      <line>Would oft anticipate his glad return,</line>
      <line>And dream of transports she was not to know.</line>
      <line> She heard the doleful tidings of his death,</line>
      <line>And never smiled again. And now she roams</line>
      <line>The dreary waste – there spends the livelong day,</line>
      <line>And there (unless when charity forbids)</line>
      <line>The livelong night. A tattered apron hides,</line>
      <line>Worn as a cloak – and hardly hides – a gown</line>
      <line>More tattered still! And both but ill conceal</line>
      <line>A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.</line>
      <line>She begs an idle pin of all she meets,</line>
      <line>And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,</line>
      <line> Though pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,</line>
      <line>Though pinched with cold, asks never – Kate is crazed.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>All shrouded in the winter snow</line>
      <line>The maiden held her way;</line>
      <line>Nor chilly winds that roughly blow,</line>
      <line>Nor dark night could her stay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> O’er hill and dale, through bush and briar,</line>
      <line>She on her journey kept;</line>
      <line>Save often, when she gan to tire,</line>
      <line>She stopped awhile and wept.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wild creatures left their caverns drear,</line>
      <line>To raise their nightly yell;</line>
      <line>But little does the bosom fear</line>
      <line>Where inward troubles dwell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No watch-light from the distant spire</line>
      <line>To cheer the gloom so deep,</line>
      <line> Nor twinkling star, nor cottage fire,</line>
      <line>Did through the darkness peep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet heedless still she held her way,</line>
      <line>Nor feared she crag, nor dell,</line>
      <line>Like ghost that through the gloom to stray</line>
      <line>Wakes with the midnight bell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now night through her dark watches ran,</line>
      <line>Which lock the peaceful mind,</line>
      <line>And through the neighbouring hamlets ’gan</line>
      <line>To wake the yawning hind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Yet bark of dog, nor village cock,</line>
      <line>That spoke the morning near,</line>
      <line>Nor gray light trembling on the rock,</line>
      <line>Her ’nighted mind could cheer.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The whirling flail, and clacking mill,</line>
      <line>Wake early with the day;</line>
      <line>And careless children, loud and shrill,</line>
      <line>With new-made snowballs play,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And as she passed each cottage-door</line>
      <line>They did their gambols cease;</line>
      <line> And old men shook their locks so hoar</line>
      <line>And wished her spirit peace.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For sometimes slow, and sometimes fast,</line>
      <line>She held her wavering pace,</line>
      <line>Like early spring’s inconstant blast</line>
      <line>That ruffles evening’s face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length with weary feet she came</line>
      <line>Where in a sheltering wood,</line>
      <line>Whose master bore no humble name,</line>
      <line>A stately castle stood.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The open gate and smoking fires,</line>
      <line>Which cloud the air so thin,</line>
      <line>And shrill bell tinkling from the spires,</line>
      <line>Bespoke a feast within.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With busy looks, and hasty tread,</line>
      <line>The servants cross the hall,</line>
      <line>And many a page in buskins red</line>
      <line>Await the master’s call.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fair streaming bows of bridal white</line>
      <line>On every shoulder played,</line>
      <line> And clean, in lily kerchief dight,</line>
      <line>Tripped every household maid.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She asked for neither lord nor dame,</line>
      <line>Nor who the mansion owned,</line>
      <line>But straight into the hall she came</line>
      <line>And sat her on the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The busy crew all crowded nigh,</line>
      <line>And round the stranger stared;</line>
      <line>But still she rolled her wandering eye,</line>
      <line>Nor for their questions cared.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘What dost thou want, thou storm-beat maid,</line>

      <line>Thou art no bidden guest.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh chide not’, said a gentle page,</line>
      <line>And wiped his tear-wet cheek,</line>
      <line>‘Who would not shun the winter’s rage? –</line>
      <line>The wind is cold and bleak!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her robe is stiff with drizzly snow,</line>
      <line>And rent her mantle grey –</line>
      <line> None ever bade the wretched go</line>
      <line>Upon his wedding-day!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then to his lord he hied him straight,</line>
      <line>(Where round on silken seat</line>
      <line>Sat many a courteous dame and knight</line>
      <line>And made obeisance meet:</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘There is a stranger in your hall</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A fairer dame in hall or bower</line>
      <line>Mine eyes did ne’er behold;</line>
      <line>Though sheltered in no father’s tower,</line>
      <line>And turned out to the cold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her face is like an early morn,</line>
      <line>Dimmed with the nightly dew;</line>
      <line>Her skin is like the sheeted thorn,</line>
      <line>Her eyes are watery blue.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And tall and slender is her form,</line>
      <line>Like willow o’er the brook;</line>
      <line> But on her brow there broods a storm,</line>
      <line>And restless is her look.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And well her troubled motions show</line>
      <line>The tempest of her mind,</line>
      <line>Like the unsheltered sapling-bough</line>
      <line>Vexed with the wintry wind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her head droops on her ungirt breast,</line>
      <line>And scattered is her hair;</line>
      <line>Yet lady braced in courtly vest</line>
      <line>Was never half so fair!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Reverse, and cold, the turning blood</line>
      <line>The bridegroom’s cheek forsook:</line>
      <line>He shook and staggered as he stood,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘So soft and fair I know a maid,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Deep frowning turned the bride’s dark eye,</line>
      <line>For bridal morn unmeet:</line>
      <line> With trembling steps her lord did hie</line>
      <line>The stranger fair to greet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Though loose in scattered weeds arrayed,</line>
      <line>And ruffled by the storm,</line>
      <line>Like lambkin from its fellows strayed</line>
      <line>He knew her graceful form.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when he spied her sunken eye,</line>
      <line>And features sharp and wan,</line>
      <line>He heaved a deep and heavy sigh</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Quick from her eye the keen glance came,</line>

      <line>And wist not it was he.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Full hard against his writhing brows</line>
      <line>His clenchéd hands he prest;</line>
      <line> Full high his labouring bosom rose,</line>
      <line>And rent its silken vest.</line>

      <line>November’s chill blast on the rough beach is howling,</line>
      <line>The surge breaks afar, and then foams to the shore,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Beneath that chalk rock, a fair stranger reclining,</line>
      <line>Has found on damp sea-weed a cold lonely seat;</line>
      <line>Her eyes filled with tears, and her heart with repining,</line>
      <line>She starts at the billows that burst at her feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There, day after day, with an anxious heart heaving,</line>

      <line>Loose stream to wild winds those fair flowing tresses,</line>
      <line>Once woven with garlands of gay summer flowers;</line>

      <line>And beauty is blighted by grief’s heavy hours.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her innocent children, unconscious of sorrow,</line>
      <line>To seek the glossed shell, or the crimson weed stray;</line>
      <line>Amused with the present, they heed not tomorrow,</line>
      <line>Nor think of the storm that is gathering today.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> To fair fortune born, she beholds them with anguish,</line>

      <line>Perhaps doomed for life in chill penury to languish,</line>
      <line>Or abject dependence, or soul-crushing toil.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the sea-boat, her hopes and her terrors renewing,</line>
      <line>O’er the dim grey horizon now faintly appears;</line>
      <line>She flies to the quay, dreading tidings of ruin,</line>
      <line>All breathless with haste, half expiring with fears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor mourner – I would that my fortune had left me</line>
      <line>The means to alleviate the woes I deplore;</line>
      <line> But like thine my hard fate has of affluence bereft me,</line>
      <line>I can warm the cold heart of the wretched no more.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I loved Theotormon</line>
      <line>And I was not ashamed,</line>
      <line>I trembled in my virgin fears</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> I plucked Leutha’s flower,</line>

      <line>My virgin mantle in twain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Enslaved, the Daughters of Albion weep – a trembling lamentation</line>
      <line>Upon their mountains, in their valleys sighs toward America.</line>
      <line>For the soft soul of America, Oothoon, wandered in woe</line>
      <line>Along the vales of Leutha, seeking flowers to comfort her,</line>
      <line> And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha’s vale:</line>
      <line>‘Art thou a flower? Art thou a nymph? I see thee now a flower,</line>
      <line>Now a nymph! I dare not pluck thee from thy dewy bed.’</line>
      <line>The golden nymph replied: ‘Pluck thou my flower, Oothoon the mild.</line>
      <line>Another flower shall spring, because the soul of sweet delight</line>
      <line>Can never pass away.’ She ceased and closed her golden shrine.</line>
      <line>Then Oothoon plucked the flower saying, ‘I pluck thee from thy bed,</line>
      <line>Sweet flower, and put thee here to glow between my breasts,</line>
      <line>And thus I turn my face to where my whole soul seeks.’</line>
      <line>Over the waves she went in winged exulting swift delight,</line>
      <line> And over Theotormon’s reign, took her impetuous course.</line>
      <line>Bromion rent her with his thunders. On his stormy bed</line>
      <line>Lay the faint maid, and soon her woes appalled his thunders hoarse.</line>
      <line>Bromion spoke: ‘Behold this harlot here on Bromion’s bed,</line>
      <line>And let the jealous dolphins sport around the lovely maid!</line>
      <line>Thy soft American plains are mine, and mine thy north and south.</line>
      <line>Stamped with my signet are the swarthy children of the sun –</line>
      <line>They are obedient, they resist not, they obey the scourge,</line>
      <line>Their daughters worship terrors and obey the violent!</line>
      <line>Now thou mayst marry Bromion’s harlot and protect the child</line>
      <line> Of Bromion’s rage that Oothoon shall put forth in nine moons time.’</line>
      <line>Then storms rent Theotormon’s limbs; he rolled his waves around</line>
      <line>And folded his black jealous waters round the adulterate pair.</line>
      <line>Bound back to back in Bromion’s caves, terror and meekness dwell;</line>
      <line>At entrance Theotormon sits, wearing the threshold hard</line>
      <line>With secret tears. Beneath him sound like waves on a desert-shore</line>
      <line>The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money</line>
      <line>That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires</line>
      <line>Of lust that belch incessant, from the summits of the earth.</line>
      <line>Oothoon weeps not. She cannot weep – her tears are locked up –</line>
      <line> But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs</line>
      <line>And calling Theotormon’s eagles to prey upon her flesh:</line>
      <line>‘I call with holy voice, kings of the sounding air!</line>
      <line>Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect</line>
      <line>The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.’</line>
      <line>The eagles at her call descend and rend their bleeding prey;</line>
      <line>Theotormon severely smiles. Her soul reflects the smile,</line>
      <line>As the clear spring, muddied with feet of beasts, grows pure and smiles.</line>
      <line>The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, and echo back her sighs.</line>
      <line>‘Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold</line>
      <line> And Oothoon hovers by his side, persuading him in vain?</line>
      <line>I cry “arise”, oh Theotormon, for the village dog</line>
      <line>Barks at the breaking day, the nightingale has done lamenting,</line>
      <line>The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the eagle returns</line>
      <line>From nightly prey and lifts his golden beak to the pure east,</line>
      <line>Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake</line>
      <line>The sun that sleeps too long. Arise, my Theotormon, I am pure –</line>
      <line>Because the night is gone that closed me in its deadly black.</line>
      <line>They told me that the night and day were all that I could see,</line>
      <line>They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up,</line>
      <line> And they inclosed my infinite brain into a narrow circle</line>
      <line>And sunk my heart into the abyss, a red round globe hot burning –</line>
      <line>Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.</line>
      <line>Instead of morn arises a bright shadow like an eye</line>
      <line>In the eastern cloud, instead of night a sickly charnel-house,</line>
      <line>That Theotormon hears me not! To him the night and morn</line>
      <line>Are both alike – a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears –</line>
      <line>And none but Bromion can hear my lamentations.</line>
      <line>With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?</line>
      <line>With what sense does the tame pigeon measure out the expanse?</line>
      <line>With what sense does the bee form cells? Have not the mouse and frog</line>
      <line>Eyes and ears and sense of touch – yet are their habitations</line>
      <line>And their pursuits as different as their forms and as their joys?</line>
      <line>Ask the wild ass why he refuses burdens, and the meek camel</line>
      <line>Why he loves man. Is it because of eye, ear, mouth, or skin,</line>
      <line>Or breathing nostrils? No, for these the wolf and tiger have.</line>
      <line>Ask the blind worm the secrets of the grave, and why her spires</line>
      <line>Love to curl round the bones of death, and ask the ravenous snake</line>
      <line>Where she gets poison, and the winged eagle why he loves the sun –</line>
      <line>And then tell me the thoughts of man, that have been hid of old.</line>
      <line> Silent I hover all the night, and all day could be silent</line>
      <line>If Theotormon once would turn his loved eyes upon me.</line>
      <line>How can I be defiled when I reflect thy image pure?</line>
      <line>Sweetest the fruit that the worm feeds on, and the soul preyed on by woe,</line>
      <line>The new-washed lamb tinged with the village smoke, and the bright swan</line>
      <line>By the red earth of our immortal river. I bathe my wings,</line>
      <line>And I am white and pure to hover round Theotormon’s breast.’</line>
      <line>Then Theotormon broke his silence, and he answered:</line>
      <line>‘Tell me what is the night or day to one o’erflowed with woe!</line>
      <line>Tell me what is a thought, and of what substance is it made!</line>
      <line> Tell me what is a joy, and in what gardens do joys grow!</line>
      <line>And in what rivers swim the sorrows, and upon what mountains</line>
      <line>Wave shadows of discontent, and in what houses dwell the wretched</line>
      <line>Drunken with woe, forgotten and shut up from cold despair?</line>
      <line>Tell me where dwell the thoughts forgotten till thou call them forth!</line>
      <line>Tell me where dwell the joys of old, and where the ancient loves,</line>
      <line>And when will they renew again, and the night of oblivion past –</line>
      <line>That I might traverse times and spaces far remote and bring</line>
      <line>Comforts into a present sorrow, and a night of pain.</line>
      <line>Where goest thou, oh thought, to what remote land is thy flight?</line>
      <line> If thou returnest to the present moment of affliction</line>
      <line>Wilt thou bring comforts on thy wings, and dews and honey and balm,</line>
      <line>Or poison from the desert wilds, from the eyes of the envier?’</line>
      <line>Then Bromion said, and shook the cavern with his lamentation:</line>
      <line>‘Thou knowest that the ancient trees seen by thine eyes have fruit,</line>
      <line>But knowest thou that trees and fruits flourish upon the earth</line>
      <line>To gratify senses unknown – trees, beasts and birds, unknown –</line>
      <line>Unknown not unperceived, spread in the infinite microscope</line>
      <line>In places yet unvisited by the voyager, and in worlds</line>
      <line>Over another kind of seas, and in atmospheres unknown?</line>
      <line>Ah, are there other wars beside the wars of sword and fire?</line>
      <line>And are there other sorrows beside the sorrows of poverty?</line>
      <line>And are there other joys beside the joys of riches and ease?</line>
      <line>And is there not one law for both the lion and the ox?</line>
      <line>And is there not eternal fire, and eternal chains,</line>
      <line>To bind the phantoms of existence from eternal life?’</line>
      <line>Then Oothoon waited silent all the day and all the night,</line>
      <line>But when the morn arose, her lamentation renewed.</line>
      <line>The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, and echo back her sighs.</line>
      <line>‘Oh Urizen, creator of men, mistaken demon of Heaven,</line>
      <line> Thy joys are tears, thy labour vain to form men to thine image!</line>
      <line>How can one joy absorb another? Are not different joys</line>
      <line>Holy, eternal, infinite? – and each joy is a love.</line>
      <line>Does not the great mouth laugh at a gift, and the narrow eyelids mock</line>
      <line>At the labour that is above payment – and wilt thou take the ape</line>
      <line>For thy councilor, or the dog for a schoolmaster to thy children?</line>
      <line>Does he who condemns poverty, and he who turns with abhorrence</line>
      <line>From usury, feel the same passion, or are they moved alike?</line>
      <line>How can the giver of gifts experience the delights of the merchant,</line>
      <line>How the industrious citizen the pains of the husbandman?</line>
      <line> How different far the fat-fed hireling with hollow drum,</line>
      <line>Who buys whole cornfields into wastes, and sings upon the heath –</line>
      <line>How different their eye and ear, how different the world to them!</line>
      <line>With what sense does the parson claim the labour of the farmer?</line>
      <line>What are his nets and gins and traps, and how does he surround him</line>
      <line>With cold floods of abstraction and with forests of solitude,</line>
      <line>To build him castles and high spires where kings and priests may dwell,</line>
      <line>Till she who burns with youth and knows no fixed lot is bound</line>
      <line>In spells of law to one she loathes? And must she drag the chain</line>
      <line>Of life in weary lust? Must chilling murderous thoughts obscure</line>
      <line> The clear heaven of her eternal spring – to bear the wintry rage</line>
      <line>Of a harsh terror, driven to madness, bound to hold a rod</line>
      <line>Over her shrinking shoulders all the day, and all the night</line>
      <line>To turn the wheel of false desire, and longings that wake her womb</line>
      <line>To the abhorréd birth of cherubs in the human form</line>
      <line>That live a pestilence, and die a meteor, and are no more –</line>
      <line>Till the child dwell with one he hates, and do the deed he loathes,</line>
      <line>And the impure scourge force his seed into its unripe birth</line>
      <line>E’er yet his eyelids can behold the arrows of the day.</line>
      <line>Does the whale worship at thy footsteps as the hungry dog,</line>
      <line> Or does he scent the mountain prey because his nostrils wide</line>
      <line>Draw in the ocean? Does his eye discern the flying cloud</line>
      <line>As the raven’s eye, or does he measure the expanse like the vulture?</line>
      <line>Does the still spider view the cliffs where eagles hide their young,</line>
      <line>Or does the fly rejoice because the harvest is brought in?</line>
      <line>Does not the eagle scorn the earth and despise the treasures beneath –</line>
      <line>But the mole knoweth what is there, and the worm shall tell it thee.</line>
      <line>Does not the worm erect a pillar in the mouldering churchyard,</line>
      <line>And a place of eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave?</line>
      <line>Over his porch these words are written: “Take thy bliss oh man,</line>
      <line> And sweet shall be thy taste and sweet thy infant joys renew.”</line>
      <line>Infancy, fearless, lustful, happy, nestling for delight</line>
      <line>In laps of pleasure! Innocence, honest, open, seeking</line>
      <line>The vigorous joys of morning-light, open to virgin bliss!</line>
      <line>Who taught thee modesty, subtle modesty, child of night and sleep?</line>
      <line>When thou awakest wilt thou dissemble all thy secret joys,</line>
      <line>Or wert thou not awake when all this mystery was disclosed?</line>
      <line>Then comest thou forth a modest virgin, knowing to dissemble,</line>
      <line>With nets found under thy night-pillow to catch virgin joy,</line>
      <line>And brand it with the name of whore and sell it in the night</line>
      <line> In silence, even without a whisper, and in seeming sleep.</line>
      <line>Religious dreams and holy vespers light thy smoky fires:</line>
      <line>Once were thy fires lighted by the eyes of honest morn.</line>
      <line>And does my Theotormon seek this hypocrite modesty –</line>
      <line>This knowing, artful, secret, fearful, cautious, trembling hypocrite?</line>
      <line>Then is Oothoon a whore indeed, and all the virgin joys</line>
      <line>Of life are harlots, and Theotormon is a sick man’s dream,</line>
      <line>And Oothoon is the crafty slave of selfish holiness!</line>
      <line>But Oothoon is not so – a virgin filled with virgin fancies</line>
      <line>Open to joy and to delight wherever beauty appears!</line>
      <line> If in the morning sun I find it, there my eyes are fixed</line>
      <line>In happy copulation; if in evening mild, wearied with work,</line>
      <line>Sit on a bank and draw the pleasures of this free-born joy.</line>
      <line>The moment of desire! The moment of desire! The virgin</line>
      <line>That pines for man shall awaken her womb to enormous joys</line>
      <line>In the secret shadows of her chamber. The youth shut up from</line>
      <line>The lustful joy shall forget to generate, and create an amorous image</line>
      <line>In the shadows of his curtains, and in the folds of his silent pillow.</line>
      <line>Are not these the places of religion, the rewards of continence,</line>
      <line>The self-enjoyings of self-denial? Why dost thou seek religion?</line>
      <line> Is it because acts are not lovely that thou seekest solitude,</line>
      <line>Where the horrible darkness is impressed with reflections of desire?</line>
      <line>Father of Jealousy, be thou accurséd from the earth!</line>
      <line>Why hast thou taught my Theotormon this accurséd thing?</line>
      <line>Till beauty fades from off my shoulders, darkened and cast out,</line>
      <line>A solitary shadow wailing on the margin of non-entity.</line>
      <line>I cry, love! love! love! Happy, happy love, free as the mountain wind!</line>
      <line>Can that be love that drinks another as a sponge drinks water –</line>
      <line>That clouds with jealousy his nights, with weepings all the day,</line>
      <line>To spin a web of age around him, grey and hoary, dark,</line>
      <line> Till his eyes sicken at the fruit that hangs before his sight?</line>
      <line>Such is self-love that envies all, a creeping skeleton</line>
      <line>With lamplike eyes watching around the frozen marriage-bed.</line>
      <line>But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread,</line>
      <line>And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold!</line>
      <line>I’ll lie beside thee on a bank and view their wanton play</line>
      <line>In lovely copulation, bliss on bliss with Theotormon.</line>
      <line>Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first-born beam,</line>
      <line>Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e’er with jealous cloud</line>
      <line>Come in the heaven of generous love, nor selfish blightings bring.</line>
      <line>Does the sun walk in glorious raiment on the secret floor</line>
      <line>Where the cold miser spreads his gold? Or does the bright cloud drop</line>
      <line>On his stone threshold? Does his eye behold the beam that brings</line>
      <line>Expansion to the eye of pity? Or will he bind himself</line>
      <line>Beside the ox to thy hard furrow? Does not that mild beam blot</line>
      <line>The bat, the owl, the glowing tiger, and the king of night?</line>
      <line>The sea-fowl takes the wintry blast for a covering to her limbs,</line>
      <line>And the wild snake the pestilence to adorn him with gems and gold –</line>
      <line>And trees and birds and beasts and men behold their eternal joy.</line>
      <line>Arise you little glancing wings, and sing your infant joy!</line>
      <line> Arise and drink your bliss, for every thing that lives is holy!’</line>
      <line>Thus every morning wails Oothoon. But Theotormon sits</line>
      <line>Upon the margined ocean conversing with shadows dire.</line>
      <line>The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, and echo back her sighs.</line>

    <title>Mary the Maid of the Inn</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who is she, the poor maniac, whose wildly-fixed eyes</line>
      <line>Seem a heart overcharged to express?</line>
      <line>She weeps not, yet often and deeply she sighs;</line>
      <line>She never complains, but her silence implies</line>
      <line> The composure of settled distress.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No aid, no compassion, the maniac will seek –</line>
      <line>Cold and hunger awake not her care.</line>
      <line>Through her rags do the winds of the winter blow bleak</line>
      <line>On her poor withered bosom, half bare, and her cheek</line>
      <line>Hath the deathy pale hue of despair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet cheerful and happy – nor distant the day –</line>
      <line>Poor Mary the Maniac has been:</line>
      <line>The traveller remembers, who journeyed this way,</line>
      <line>No damsel so lovely, no damsel so gay,</line>
      <line> As Mary the Maid of the Inn!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her cheerful address filled the guests with delight</line>
      <line>As she welcomed them in with a smile;</line>
      <line>Her heart was a stranger to childish affright,</line>
      <line>And Mary would walk by the Abbey at night</line>
      <line>When the wind whistled down the dark aisle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She loved – and young Richard had settled the day,</line>
      <line>And she hoped to be happy for life –</line>
      <line>But Richard was idle, and worthless, and they</line>
      <line>Who knew him would pity poor Mary, and say</line>
      <line> That she was too good for his wife.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas in autumn, and stormy and dark was the night,</line>
      <line>And fast were the windows and door;</line>
      <line>Two guests sat enjoying the fire that burnt bright,</line>
      <line>And, smoking in silence with tranquil delight,</line>
      <line>They listened to hear the wind roar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘’Tis pleasant’, cried one, ‘seated by the fireside,</line>
      <line>To hear the wind whistle without.’</line>
      <line>‘A fine night for the Abbey!’ his comrade replied,</line>
      <line>‘Methinks a man’s courage would now be well tried</line>
      <line> Who should wander the ruins about.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I myself, like a schoolboy, should tremble to hear</line>
      <line>The hoarse ivy shake over my head,</line>
      <line>And could fancy I saw, half persuaded by fear,</line>
      <line>Some ugly old Abbot’s white spirit appear –</line>
      <line>For this wind might awaken the dead!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘I’ll wager a dinner’, the other one cried,</line>
      <line>‘That Mary would venture there now!’</line>
      <line>‘Then wager, and lose!’ with a sneer he replied,</line>
      <line>‘I’ll warrant she’d fancy a ghost by her side,</line>
      <line> And faint if she saw a white cow!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Will Mary this charge on her courage allow?’</line>
      <line>His companion exclaimed with a smile –</line>
      <line>‘I shall win, for I know she will venture there now,</line>
      <line>And earn a new bonnet by bringing a bough</line>
      <line>From the elder that grows in the aisle.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With fearless good humour did Mary comply,</line>
      <line>And her way to the Abbey she bent;</line>
      <line>The night was dark, and the wind was high,</line>
      <line>And as hollowly howling it swept through the sky</line>
      <line> She shivered with cold as she went,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O’er the path so well-known still proceeded the Maid</line>
      <line>Where the Abbey rose dim on the sight;</line>
      <line>Through the gateway she entered – she felt not afraid,</line>
      <line>Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade</line>
      <line>Seemed to deepen the gloom of the night.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All around her was silent, save when the rude blast</line>
      <line>Howled dismally round the old pile;</line>
      <line>Over weed-covered fragments still fearless she passed,</line>
      <line>And arrived in the innermost ruin at last</line>
      <line> Where the elder-tree grew in the aisle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well pleased did she reach it, and quickly drew near,</line>
      <line>And hastily gathered the bough –</line>
      <line>When the sound of a voice seemed to rise on her ear;</line>
      <line>She paused, and she listened, all eager to hear,</line>
      <line>And her heart panted painfully now.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head;</line>
      <line>She listened – nought else could she hear!</line>
      <line>The wind ceased – her heart sunk in her bosom with dread,</line>
      <line>For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread</line>
      <line> Of footsteps approaching her near.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Behind a wide column, half breathless with fear</line>
      <line>She crept to conceal herself there;</line>
      <line>That instant the moon o’er a dark cloud shone clear,</line>
      <line>And she saw in the moonlight two ruffians appear,</line>
      <line>And between them a corpse did they bear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then Mary could feel her heart-blood curdle cold;</line>
      <line>Again the rough wind hurried by:</line>
      <line>It blew off the hat of the one – and behold</line>
      <line>Even close to the feet of poor Mary it rolled!</line>
      <line> She felt, and expected to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Curse the hat!’ he exclaims. ‘Nay, come on and first hide</line>
      <line>The dead body’, his comrade replies.</line>
      <line>She beheld them in safety pass on by her side,</line>
      <line>She seizes the hat – fear her courage supplied –</line>
      <line>And fast through the Abbey she flies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She ran with wild speed, she rushed in at the door,</line>
      <line>She gazed horribly eager around;</line>
      <line>Then her limbs could support their faint burden no more,</line>
      <line>And exhausted and breathless she sunk on the floor,</line>
      <line> Unable to utter a sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ere yet her pale lips could the story impart,</line>
      <line>For a moment the hat met her view;</line>
      <line>Her eyes from that object convulsively start,</line>
      <line>For – oh God – what cold horror then thrilled through her heart</line>
      <line>When the name of her Richard she knew!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where the old Abbey stands, on the common hard by,</line>
      <line>His gibbet is now to be seen –</line>
      <line>Not far from the road it engages the eye –</line>
      <line>The traveller beholds it, and thinks with a sigh</line>
      <line>Of poor Mary, the Maid of the Inn.</line>

    <title>Old Man Travelling</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The little hedgerow-birds</line>
      <line>That peck along the road, regard him not;</line>
      <line>He travels on, and in his face, his step,</line>
      <line>His gait, is one expression. Every limb,</line>
      <line> His look and bending figure, all bespeak</line>
      <line>A man who does not move with pain, but moves</line>
      <line>With thought. He is insensibly subdued</line>
      <line>To settled quiet, he is one by whom</line>
      <line>All effort seems forgotten – one to whom</line>
      <line>O Long patience hath such mild composure given</line>
      <line>That patience now doth seem a thing of which</line>
      <line>He hath no need. He is by Nature led</line>
      <line>To peace so perfect that the young behold</line>
      <line>With envy what the old man hardly feels.</line>

    <title>The Discharged Soldier</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I love to walk</line>
      <line>Along the public way when, for the night</line>
      <line>Deserted in its silence, it assumes</line>
      <line>A character of deeper quietness</line>
      <line> Than pathless solitudes. At such a time</line>
      <line>I slowly mounted up a steep ascent</line>
      <line>Where the road’s watery surface to the ridge</line>
      <line>Of that sharp rising glittered in the moon,</line>
      <line>And seemed before my eyes another stream</line>
      <line>Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook</line>
      <line>That murmured in the valley. On I passed</line>
      <line>Tranquil, receiving in my own despite</line>
      <line>Amusement, as I slowly passed along,</line>
      <line>From such near objects as from time to time</line>
      <line> Perforce disturbed the slumber of the sense</line>
      <line>Quiescent and disposed to sympathy –</line>
      <line>With an exhausted mind worn out by toil</line>
      <line>And all unworthy of the deeper joy</line>
      <line>Which waits on distant prospect, cliff or sea,</line>
      <line>The dark blue vault, and universe of stars.</line>
      <line>Thus did I steal along that silent road,</line>
      <line>My body from the stillness drinking in</line>
      <line>A restoration like the calm of sleep</line>
      <line>But sweeter far. Above, before, behind,</line>
      <line> Around me, all was peace and solitude:</line>
      <line>I looked not round, nor did the solitude</line>
      <line>Speak to my eye, but it was heard and felt.</line>
      <line>Oh happy state – what beauteous pictures now</line>
      <line>Rose in harmonious imagery! They rose</line>
      <line>As from some distant region of my soul</line>
      <line>And came along like dreams – yet such as left</line>
      <line>Obscurely mingled with their passing forms</line>
      <line>A consciousness of animal delight,</line>
      <line>A self-possession felt in every pause</line>
      <line> And every gentle movement of my frame.</line>
      <line>While thus I wandered, step by step led on,</line>
      <line>It chanced a sudden turning of the road</line>
      <line>Presented to my view an uncouth shape</line>
      <line>So near that, stepping back into the shade</line>
      <line>Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,</line>
      <line>Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,</line>
      <line>A foot above man’s common measure tall,</line>
      <line>And lank, and upright. There was in his form</line>
      <line>A meagre stiffness – you might almost think</line>
      <line> That his bones wounded him. His legs were long,</line>
      <line>So long and shapeless that I looked at them</line>
      <line>Forgetful of the body they sustained.</line>
      <line>His arms were long and lean; his hands were bare;</line>
      <line>His visage, wasted though it seemed, was large</line>
      <line>In feature; his cheeks sunken; and his mouth</line>
      <line>Showed ghastly in the moonlight. From behind,</line>
      <line>A milestone propped him, and his figure seemed</line>
      <line>Half-sitting and half-standing. I could mark</line>
      <line>That he was clad in military garb,</line>
      <line> Though faded yet entire. His face was turned</line>
      <line>Towards the road, yet not as if he sought</line>
      <line>For any living thing. He appeared</line>
      <line>Forlorn and desolate, a man cut off</line>
      <line>From all his kind, and more than half-detached</line>
      <line>From his own nature.</line>
      <line>He was alone,</line>
      <line>Had no attendant, neither dog, nor staff,</line>
      <line>Nor knapsack – in his very dress appeared</line>
      <line>A desolation, a simplicity,</line>
      <line>That appertained to solitude: I think</line>
      <line> If but a glove had dangled in his hand</line>
      <line>It would have made him more akin to man.</line>
      <line>Long time I scanned him, with a mingled sense</line>
      <line>Of fear and sorrow. From his lips meanwhile</line>
      <line>There issued murmuring sounds as if of pain</line>
      <line>Or of uneasy thought; yet still his form</line>
      <line>Kept the same fearful steadiness. His shadow</line>
      <line>Lay at his feet and moved not.</line>
      <line>In a glen</line>
      <line>Hard by, a village stood, whose silent doors</line>
      <line>Were visible among the scattered trees,</line>
      <line> Scarce distant from the spot an arrow’s flight.</line>
      <line>I wished to see him move, but he remained</line>
      <line>Fixed to his place, and still from time to time</line>
      <line>Sent forth a murmuring voice of dead complaint,</line>
      <line>A groan scarce audible. Yet all the while</line>
      <line>The chained mastiff in his wooden house</line>
      <line>Was vexed, and from among the village trees</line>
      <line>Howled never ceasing. Not without reproach</line>
      <line>Had I prolonged my watch, and now confirmed,</line>
      <line>And my heart’s specious cowardice subdued,</line>
      <line> I left the shady nook where I had stood</line>
      <line>And hailed the stranger.</line>
      <line>From his resting-place</line>
      <line>He rose, and, with his lean and wasted arm</line>
      <line>In measured gesture lifted to his head,</line>
      <line>Returned my salutation. A short while</line>
      <line>I held discourse on things indifferent</line>
      <line>And casual matter. He meanwhile had ceased</line>
      <line>From all complaint – his station had resumed,</line>
      <line>Propped by the milestone as before. And when erelong</line>
      <line>I asked his history, he in reply</line>
      <line> Was neither slow nor eager, but unmoved,</line>
      <line>And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,</line>
      <line>A stately air of mild indifference,</line>
      <line>He told a simple fact: that he had been</line>
      <line>A soldier, to the Tropic Isles had gone,</line>
      <line>Whence he had landed now some ten days past;</line>
      <line>That on his landing he had been dismissed,</line>
      <line>And with the little strength he yet had left</line>
      <line>Was travelling to regain his native home.</line>
      <line>At this I turned, and through the trees looked down</line>
      <line>Into the village – all were gone to rest:</line>
      <line>Nor smoke nor any taper-light appeared,</line>
      <line>But every silent window to the moon</line>
      <line>Shone with a yellow glitter. ‘No one there’,</line>
      <line>Said I, ‘is waking; we must measure back</line>
      <line>The way which we have come. Behind yon wood</line>
      <line>A labourer dwells, an honest man and kind;</line>
      <line>He will not murmur should we break his rest,</line>
      <line>And he will give you food if food you need,</line>
      <line>And lodging for the night.’ At this he stooped,</line>
      <line> And from the ground took up an oaken staff</line>
      <line>By me yet unobserved, a traveller’s staff,</line>
      <line>Which I suppose from his slack hand had dropped,</line>
      <line>And (such the languor of the weary man)</line>
      <line>Had lain till now neglected in the grass,</line>
      <line>But not forgotten.</line>
      <line>Back we turned and shaped</line>
      <line>Our course toward the cottage. He appeared</line>
      <line>To travel without pain, and I beheld</line>
      <line>With ill-suppressed astonishment his tall</line>
      <line>And ghostly figure moving at my side.</line>
      <line> As we advanced I asked him for what cause</line>
      <line>He tarried there, nor had demanded rest</line>
      <line>At inn or cottage. He replied, ‘In truth</line>
      <line>My weakness made me loath to move, and here</line>
      <line>I felt myself at ease and much relieved –</line>
      <line>But that the village mastiff fretted me,</line>
      <line>And every second moment rang a peal</line>
      <line>Felt at my very heart. There was no noise,</line>
      <line>Nor any foot abroad; I do not know</line>
      <line>What ailed him, but it seemed as if the dog</line>
      <line> Were howling to the murmur of the stream.’</line>
      <line>While thus we travelled on I did not fail</line>
      <line>To question him of what he had endured</line>
      <line>From war and battle and the pestilence.</line>
      <line>He all the while was in demeanour calm,</line>
      <line>Concise in answer: solemn and sublime</line>
      <line>He might have seemed, but that in all he said</line>
      <line>There was a strange half-absence and a tone</line>
      <line>Of weakness and indifference, as of one</line>
      <line>Remembering the importance of his theme,</line>
      <line> But feeling it no longer. We advanced</line>
      <line>Slowly, and ere we to the wood were come</line>
      <line>Discourse had ceased. Together on we passed</line>
      <line>In silence through the shades gloomy and dark,</line>
      <line>Then turning up along an open field</line>
      <line>We gained the cottage.</line>
      <line>At the door I knocked,</line>
      <line>And called aloud, ‘My friend, here is a man</line>
      <line>By sickness overcome; beneath your roof</line>
      <line>This night let him find rest, and give him food –</line>
      <line>The service if need be I will requite.’</line>
      <line> Assured that now my comrade would repose</line>
      <line>In comfort, I entreated that henceforth</line>
      <line>He would not linger in the public ways</line>
      <line>But at the door of cottage or of inn</line>
      <line>Demand the succour which his state required,</line>
      <line>And told him, feeble as he was, ’twere fit</line>
      <line>He asked relief or alms. At this reproof,</line>
      <line>With the same ghastly mildness in his look,</line>
      <line>He said, ‘My trust is in the God of Heaven,</line>
      <line>And in the eye of him that passes me.’</line>
      <line> By this the labourer had unlocked the door,</line>
      <line>And now my comrade touched his hat again</line>
      <line>With his lean hand, and, in a voice that seemed</line>
      <line>To speak with a reviving interest</line>
      <line>Till then unfelt, he thanked me. I returned</line>
      <line>The blessing of the poor unhappy man,</line>
      <line>And so we parted.</line>

    <title>The Mad Mother</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her eyes are wild, her head is bare,</line>
      <line>The sun has burnt her coal-black hair,</line>
      <line>Her eyebrows have a rusty stain,</line>
      <line>And she came far from over the main.</line>
      <line> She has a baby on her arm,</line>
      <line>Or else she were alone;</line>
      <line>And underneath the haystack warm,</line>
      <line>And on the greenwood stone,</line>
      <line>She talked and sung the woods among,</line>
      <line>And it was in the English tongue.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Sweet babe, they say that I am mad,</line>
      <line>But nay, my heart is far too glad,</line>
      <line>And I am happy when I sing</line>
      <line>Full many a sad and doleful thing!</line>
      <line> Then, lovely baby, do not fear –</line>
      <line>I pray thee have no fear of me –</line>
      <line>But, safe as in a cradle, here,</line>
      <line>My lovely baby, thou shalt be.</line>
      <line>To thee I know too much I owe;</line>
      <line>I cannot work thee any woe.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A fire was once within my brain,</line>
      <line>And in my head a dull dull pain,</line>
      <line>And fiendish faces one, two, three,</line>
      <line>Hung at my breasts, and pulled at me.</line>
      <line> But then there came a sight of joy</line>
      <line>(It came at once to do me good),</line>
      <line>I waked and saw my little boy,</line>
      <line>My little boy of flesh and blood –</line>
      <line>Oh joy for me that sight to see</line>
      <line>For he was here, and only he!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Suck, little babe, oh suck again –</line>
      <line>It cools my blood, it cools my brain!</line>
      <line>Thy lips I feel them, baby, they</line>
      <line>Draw from my heart the pain away.</line>
      <line> Oh press me with thy little hand,</line>
      <line>It loosens something at my chest –</line>
      <line>About that tight and deadly band</line>
      <line>I feel thy little fingers pressed.</line>
      <line>The breeze I see is in the tree;</line>
      <line>It comes to cool my babe and me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh love me, love me, little boy,</line>
      <line>Thou art thy mother’s only joy,</line>
      <line>And do not dread the waves below,</line>
      <line>When o’er the sea-rock’s edge we go.</line>
      <line> The high crag cannot work me harm,</line>
      <line>Nor leaping torrents when they howl:</line>
      <line>The babe I carry on my arm,</line>
      <line>He saves for me my precious soul!</line>
      <line>Then happy lie, for blest am I –</line>
      <line>Without me my sweet babe would die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then do not fear, my boy, for thee</line>
      <line>Bold as a lion I will be;</line>
      <line>And I will always be thy guide,</line>
      <line>Through hollow snows and rivers wide.</line>
      <line> I’ll build an Indian bower, I know</line>
      <line>The leaves that make the softest bed;</line>
      <line>And if from me thou wilt not go,</line>
      <line>But still be true till I am dead,</line>
      <line>My pretty thing, then thou shalt sing,</line>
      <line>As merry as the birds in spring.</line>

      <line>Thy father cares not for my breast –</line>
      <line>’Tis thine, sweet baby, there to rest,</line>
      <line>’Tis all thy own, and if its hue</line>
      <line>Be changed, that was so fair to view,</line>
      <line> ’Tis fair enough for thee, my dove!</line>
      <line>My beauty, little child, is flown,</line>
      <line>But thou wilt live with me in love –</line>
      <line>And what if my poor cheek be brown?</line>
      <line>’Tis well for me: thou canst not see</line>
      <line>How pale and wan it else would be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dread not their taunts, my little life,</line>
      <line>I am thy father’s wedded wife,</line>
      <line>And underneath the spreading tree</line>
      <line>We two will live in honesty.</line>
      <line> If his sweet boy he could forsake,</line>
      <line>With me he never would have stayed.</line>
      <line>From him no harm my babe can take;</line>
      <line>But he, poor man, is wretched made,</line>
      <line>And every day we two will pray</line>
      <line>For him that’s gone and far away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ll teach my boy the sweetest things;</line>
      <line>I’ll teach him how the owlet sings.</line>
      <line>My little babe, thy lips are still,</line>
      <line>And thou hast almost sucked thy fill –</line>
      <line> Where art thou gone, my own dear child?</line>
      <line>What wicked looks are those I see?</line>
      <line>Alas, alas, that look so wild,</line>
      <line>It never, never came from me!</line>
      <line>If thou art mad, my pretty lad,</line>
      <line>Then I must be for ever sad.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh smile on me, my little lamb,</line>
      <line>For I thy own dear mother am!</line>
      <line>My love for thee has well been tried –</line>
      <line>I’ve sought thy father far and wide.</line>
      <line> I know the poisons of the shade,</line>
      <line>I know the earth-nuts fit for food;</line>
      <line>Then, pretty dear, be not afraid;</line>
      <line>We’ll find thy father in the wood.</line>
      <line>Now laugh and be gay, to the woods away,</line>
      <line>And there, my babe, we’ll live for aye!’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Before I see another day,</line>
      <line>Oh let my body die away!</line>
      <line>In sleep I heard the northern gleams,</line>
      <line>The stars they were among my dreams;</line>
      <line> In sleep did I behold the skies –</line>
      <line>I saw the crackling flashes drive,</line>
      <line>And yet they are upon my eyes,</line>
      <line>And yet I am alive.</line>
      <line>Before I see another day,</line>
      <line>Oh let my body die away!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My fire is dead – it knew no pain;</line>
      <line>Yet is it dead, and I remain.</line>
      <line>All stiff with ice the ashes lie;</line>
      <line>And they are dead, and I will die.</line>
      <line> When I was well I wished to live,</line>
      <line>For clothes, for warmth, for food, and fire;</line>
      <line>But they to me no joy can give,</line>
      <line>No pleasure now, and no desire.</line>
      <line>Then here contented will I lie –</line>
      <line>Alone I cannot fear to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas, you might have dragged me on</line>
      <line>Another day, a single one!</line>
      <line>Too soon despair o’er me prevailed,</line>
      <line>Too soon my heartless spirit failed;</line>
      <line> When you were gone my limbs were stronger,</line>
      <line>And oh how grievously I rue</line>
      <line>That afterwards, a little longer,</line>
      <line>My friends, I did not follow you!</line>
      <line>For strong and without pain I lay,</line>
      <line>My friends, when you were gone away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My child, they gave thee to another,</line>
      <line>A woman who was not thy mother!</line>
      <line>When from my arms my babe they took,</line>
      <line>On me how strangely did he look:</line>
      <line> Through his whole body something ran,</line>
      <line>A most strange something did I see,</line>
      <line>As if he strove to be a man</line>
      <line>That he might pull the sledge for me!</line>
      <line>And then he stretched his arms, how wild –</line>
      <line>Oh mercy, like a little child!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My little joy! my little pride!</line>
      <line>In two days more I must have died –</line>
      <line>Then do not weep and grieve for me,</line>
      <line>I feel I must have died with thee!</line>
      <line> Oh wind that o’er my head art flying</line>
      <line>The way my friends their course did bend,</line>
      <line>I should not feel the pain of dying</line>
      <line>Could I with thee a message send.</line>
      <line>Too soon, my friends, you went away,</line>
      <line>For I had many things to say.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ll follow you across the snow –</line>
      <line>You travel heavily and slow –</line>
      <line>In spite of all my weary pain,</line>
      <line>I’ll look upon your tents again!</line>
      <line> My fire is dead, and snowy white</line>
      <line>The water which beside it stood;</line>
      <line>The wolf has come to me tonight,</line>
      <line>And he has stolen away my food –</line>
      <line>For ever left alone am I,</line>
      <line>Then wherefore should I fear to die?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My journey will be shortly run,</line>
      <line>I shall not see another sun –</line>
      <line>I cannot lift my limbs to know</line>
      <line>If they have any life or no.</line>
      <line> My poor forsaken child, if I</line>
      <line>For once could have thee close to me,</line>
      <line>With happy heart I then would die,</line>
      <line>And my last thoughts would happy be!</line>
      <line>I feel my body die away,</line>
      <line>I shall not see another day.</line>

    <title>Michael (lines 217-490)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>While this good household thus were living on</line>
      <line>From day to day, to Michael’s ear there came</line>
      <line>Distressful tidings. Long before the time</line>
      <line>Of which I speak, the shepherd had been bound</line>
      <line>In surety for his brother’s son, a man</line>
      <line>Of an industrious life and ample means,</line>
      <line>But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly</line>
      <line>Had pressed upon him, and old Michael now</line>
      <line> Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture –</line>
      <line>A grievous penalty, but little less</line>
      <line>Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,</line>
      <line>At the first hearing, for a moment took</line>
      <line>More hope out of his life than he supposed</line>
      <line>That any old man ever could have lost.</line>
      <line>As soon as he had gathered so much strength</line>
      <line>That he could look his trouble in the face,</line>
      <line>It seemed that his sole refuge was to sell</line>
      <line>A portion of his patrimonial fields.</line>
      <line> Such was his first resolve; he thought again,</line>
      <line>And his heart failed him.</line>
      <line>‘Isabel’, said he,</line>
      <line>Two evenings after he had heard the news,</line>
      <line>‘I have been toiling more than seventy years,</line>
      <line>And in the open sunshine of God’s love</line>
      <line>Have we all lived, yet if these fields of ours</line>
      <line>Should pass into a stranger’s hands, I think</line>
      <line>That I could not lie quiet in my grave.</line>
      <line>Our lot is a hard lot; the sun itself</line>
      <line>Has scarcely been more diligent than I,</line>
      <line> And I have lived to be a fool at last</line>
      <line>To my own family. An evil man</line>
      <line>That was, and made an evil choice, if he</line>
      <line>Were false to us; and if he were not false,</line>
      <line>There are ten thousand to whom loss like this</line>
      <line>Had been no sorrow. I forgive him – but</line>
      <line>’Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus!</line>
      <line>When I began, my purpose was to speak</line>
      <line>Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.</line>
      <line>Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land</line>
      <line> Shall not go from us, and it shall be free –</line>
      <line>He shall possess it, free as is the wind</line>
      <line>That passes over it. We have, thou knowest,</line>
      <line>Another kinsman; he will be our friend</line>
      <line>In this distress. He is a prosperous man,</line>
      <line>Thriving in trade, and Luke to him shall go</line>
      <line>And with his kinsman’s help and his own thrift</line>
      <line>He quickly will repair this loss, and then</line>
      <line>May come again to us. If here he stay,</line>
      <line>What can be gained?’</line>
      <line>At this the old man paused,</line>
      <line> And Isabel sat silent, for her mind</line>
      <line>Was busy looking back into past times:</line>
      <line>‘There’s Richard Bateman’, thought she to herself,</line>
      <line>‘He was a parish-boy – at the church-door</line>
      <line>They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence</line>
      <line>And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought</line>
      <line>A basket, which they filled with pedlar’s wares,</line>
      <line>And with this basket on his arm the lad</line>
      <line>Went up to London, found a master there,</line>
      <line>Who out of many chose the trusty boy</line>
      <line> To go and overlook his merchandise</line>
      <line>Beyond the seas, where he grew wondrous rich</line>
      <line>And left estates and moneys to the poor,</line>
      <line>And at his birthplace built a chapel, floored</line>
      <line>With marble which he sent from foreign lands.’</line>
      <line>These thoughts, and many others of like sort,</line>
      <line>Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,</line>
      <line>And her face brightened. The old man was glad,</line>
      <line>And thus resumed: ‘Well, Isabel, this scheme</line>
      <line>These two days has been meat and drink to me:</line>
      <line> Far more than we have lost is left us yet.</line>
      <line>We have enough – I wish indeed that I</line>
      <line>Were younger, but this hope is a good hope.</line>
      <line>Make ready Luke’s best garments; of the best</line>
      <line>Buy for him more, and let us send him forth</line>
      <line>Tomorrow, or the next day, or tonight –</line>
      <line>If he could go, the boy should go tonight!’</line>
      <line>Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth</line>
      <line>With a light heart. The housewife for five days</line>
      <line>Was restless morn and night, and all day long</line>
      <line> Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare</line>
      <line>Things needful for the journey of her son.</line>
      <line>But Isabel was glad when Sunday came</line>
      <line>To stop her in her work; for when she lay</line>
      <line>By Michael’s side, she for the two last nights</line>
      <line>Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep;</line>
      <line>And when they rose at morning she could see</line>
      <line>That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon</line>
      <line>She said to Luke, while they two by themselves</line>
      <line>Were sitting at the door: ‘Thou must not go,</line>
      <line>We have no other child but thee to lose,</line>
      <line>None to remember – do not go away,</line>
      <line>For if thou leave thy father he will die.’</line>
      <line>The lad made answer with a jocund voice,</line>
      <line>And Isabel, when she had told her fears,</line>
      <line>Recovered heart. That evening her best fare</line>
      <line>Did she bring forth, and all together sat</line>
      <line>Like happy people round a Christmas fire.</line>
      <line>Next morning Isabel resumed her work,</line>
      <line>And all the ensuing week the house appeared</line>
      <line> As cheerful as a grove in spring. At length</line>
      <line>The expected letter from their kinsman came,</line>
      <line>With kind assurances that he would do</line>
      <line>His utmost for the welfare of the boy –</line>
      <line>To which requests were added that forthwith</line>
      <line>He might be sent to him. Ten times or more</line>
      <line>The letter was read over; Isabel</line>
      <line>Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;</line>
      <line>Nor was there at that time on English land</line>
      <line>A prouder heart than Luke’s. When Isabel</line>
      <line> Had to her house returned the old man said,</line>
      <line>‘He shall depart tomorrow.’ To this word</line>
      <line>The housewife answered, talking much of things</line>
      <line>Which, if at such short notice he should go,</line>
      <line>Would surely be forgotten – but at length</line>
      <line>She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.</line>
      <line>Near the tumultuous brook of Greenhead Gill</line>
      <line>In that deep valley, Michael had designed</line>
      <line>To build a sheepfold, and before he heard</line>
      <line>The tidings of his melancholy loss</line>
      <line> For this same purpose he had gathered up</line>
      <line>A heap of stones, which close to the brook-side</line>
      <line>Lay thrown together, ready for the work.</line>
      <line>With Luke that evening thitherward he walked,</line>
      <line>And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,</line>
      <line>And thus the old man spake to him: ‘My son,</line>
      <line>Tomorrow thou wilt leave me. With full heart</line>
      <line>I look upon thee, for thou art the same</line>
      <line>That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,</line>
      <line>And all thy life hast been my daily joy.</line>
      <line> I will relate to thee some little part</line>
      <line>Of our two histories – ’twill do thee good</line>
      <line>When thou art from me, even if I should speak</line>
      <line>Of things thou canst not know of.</line>
      <line>After thou</line>
      <line>First camest into the world, as it befalls</line>
      <line>To newborn infants, thou didst sleep away</line>
      <line>Two days, and blessings from thy father’s tongue</line>
      <line>Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,</line>
      <line>And still I loved thee with increasing love.</line>
      <line>Never to living ear came sweeter sounds</line>
      <line> Than when I heard thee by our own fireside</line>
      <line>First uttering without words a natural tune –</line>
      <line>When thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy</line>
      <line>Sing at thy mother’s breast. Month followed month,</line>
      <line>And in the open fields my life was passed,</line>
      <line>And in the mountains, else I think that thou</line>
      <line>Hadst been brought up upon thy father’s knees!</line>
      <line>But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,</line>
      <line>As well thou knowest, in us the old and young</line>
      <line>Have played together! – nor with me didst thou</line>
      <line> Lack any pleasure which a boy can know.’</line>
      <line>Luke had a manly heart; but at these words</line>
      <line>He sobbed aloud. The old man grasped his hand,</line>
      <line>And said, ‘Nay, do not take it so – I see</line>
      <line>That these are things of which I need not speak.</line>
      <line>Even to the utmost have I been to thee</line>
      <line>A kind and a good father; and herein</line>
      <line>I but repay a gift which I myself</line>
      <line>Received at others’ hands, for though now old</line>
      <line>Beyond the common life of man I still</line>
      <line> Remember them who loved me in my youth.</line>
      <line>Both of them sleep together – here they lived</line>
      <line>As all their forefathers had done; and when</line>
      <line>At length their time was come, they were not loath</line>
      <line>To give their bodies to the family mould.</line>
      <line>I wished that thou shouldst live the life they lived;</line>
      <line>But ’tis a long time to look back, my son,</line>
      <line>And see so little gain from sixty years.</line>
      <line>These fields were burdened when they came to me:</line>
      <line>Till I was forty years of age, not more</line>
      <line> Than half of my inheritance was mine.</line>
      <line>I toiled and toiled – God blest me in my work,</line>
      <line>And till these three weeks past the land was free.</line>
      <line>It looks as if it never could endure</line>
      <line>Another master! Heaven forgive me, Luke,</line>
      <line>If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good</line>
      <line>That thou shouldst go.’</line>
      <line>At this the old man paused,</line>
      <line>Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,</line>
      <line>Thus after a short silence he resumed:</line>
      <line>‘This was a work for us, and now, my son,</line>
      <line> It is a work for me! But, lay one stone –</line>
      <line>Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands –</line>
      <line>I for the purpose brought thee to this place.</line>
      <line>Nay, boy, be of good hope, we both may live</line>
      <line>To see a better day! At eighty-four</line>
      <line>I still am strong and stout: do thou thy part,</line>
      <line>I will do mine. I will begin again</line>
      <line>With many tasks that were resigned to thee:</line>
      <line>Up to the heights, and in among the storms,</line>
      <line>Will I without thee go again, and do</line>
      <line>All works which I was wont to do alone</line>
      <line>Before I knew thy face.</line>
      <line>Heaven bless thee,</line>
      <line>Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast</line>
      <line>With many hopes. It should be so – yes, yes –</line>
      <line>I knew that thou couldst never have a wish</line>
      <line>To leave me, Luke. Thou hast been bound to me</line>
      <line>Only by links of love! When thou art gone</line>
      <line>What will be left to us? – but I forget</line>
      <line>My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone</line>
      <line>As I requested, and hereafter, Luke,</line>
      <line> When thou art gone away, should evil men</line>
      <line>Be thy companions, let this sheepfold be</line>
      <line>Thy anchor and thy shield. Amid all fear,</line>
      <line>And all temptation, let it be to thee</line>
      <line>An emblem of the life thy fathers lived,</line>
      <line>Who, being innocent, did for that cause</line>
      <line>Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well.</line>
      <line>When thou returnst, thou in this place wilt see</line>
      <line>A work which is not here. A covenant</line>
      <line>’Twill be between us – but whatever fate</line>
      <line> Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last,</line>
      <line>And bear thy memory with me to the grave.’</line>
      <line>The shepherd ended here, and Luke stooped down</line>
      <line>And, as his father had requested, laid</line>
      <line>The first stone of the sheepfold. At the sight</line>
      <line>The old man’s grief broke from him. To his heart</line>
      <line>He pressed his son; he kissed him and he wept,</line>
      <line>And to the house together they returned.</line>
      <line>Next morning, as had been resolved, the boy</line>
      <line>Began his journey; and when he had reached</line>
      <line> The public way he put on a bold face,</line>
      <line>And all the neighbours as he passed their doors</line>
      <line>Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers</line>
      <line>That followed him till he was out of sight.</line>
      <line>A good report did from their kinsman come</line>
      <line>Of Luke and his well-doing; and the boy</line>
      <line>Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,</line>
      <line>Which, as the housewife phrased it, were throughout</line>
      <line>The prettiest letters that were ever seen!</line>
      <line>Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.</line>
      <line> So many months passed on, and once again</line>
      <line>The shepherd went about his daily work</line>
      <line>With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now</line>
      <line>Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour</line>
      <line>He to that valley took his way, and there</line>
      <line>Wrought at the sheepfold. Meantime Luke began</line>
      <line>To slacken in his duty, and at length</line>
      <line>He in the dissolute city gave himself</line>
      <line>To evil courses. Ignominy and shame</line>
      <line>Fell on him, so that he was driven at last</line>
      <line> To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.</line>
      <line>There is a comfort in the strength of love,</line>
      <line>’Twill make a thing endurable which else</line>
      <line>Would break the heart – old Michael found it so.</line>
      <line>I have conversed with more than one who well</line>
      <line>Remember the old man, and what he was</line>
      <line>Years after he had heard this heavy news.</line>
      <line>His bodily frame had been from youth to age</line>
      <line>Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks</line>
      <line>He went, and still looked up upon the sun</line>
      <line> And listened to the wind, and, as before,</line>
      <line>Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep</line>
      <line>And for the land, his small inheritance.</line>
      <line>And to that hollow dell from time to time</line>
      <line>Did he repair, to build the fold of which</line>
      <line>His flock had need. ’Tis not forgotten yet</line>
      <line>The pity which was then in every heart</line>
      <line>For the old man, and ’tis believed by all</line>
      <line>That many and many a day he thither went,</line>
      <line>And never lifted up a single stone.</line>
      <line> There by the sheepfold sometimes was he seen</line>
      <line>Sitting alone, with that his faithful dog</line>
      <line>(Then old) beside him, lying at his feet.</line>
      <line>The length of full seven years from time to time</line>
      <line>He at the building of this sheepfold wrought,</line>
      <line>And left the work unfinished when he died.</line>
      <line>Three years, or little more, did Isabel</line>
      <line>Survive her husband; at her death the estate</line>
      <line>Was sold, and went into a stranger’s hand.</line>
      <line>The cottage which was named the Evening Star</line>
      <line> Is gone; the ploughshare has been through the ground</line>
      <line>On which it stood. Great changes have been wrought</line>
      <line>In all the neighbourhood; yet the oak is left</line>
      <line>That grew beside their door, and the remains</line>
      <line>Of the unfinished sheepfold may be seen</line>
      <line>Beside the boisterous brook of Greenhead Gill.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was a roaring in the wind all night,</line>
      <line>The rain came heavily and fell in floods,</line>
      <line>But now the sun is rising calm and bright,</line>
      <line>The birds are singing in the distant woods,</line>
      <line> Over his own sweet voice the stock-dove broods,</line>
      <line>The jay makes answer as the magpie chatters,</line>
      <line>And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All things that love the sun are out of doors,</line>
      <line>The sky rejoices in the morning’s birth,</line>
      <line>The grass is bright with raindrops; on the moors</line>
      <line>The hare is running races in her mirth,</line>
      <line>And with her feet she from the plashy earth</line>
      <line>Raises a mist which, glittering in the sun,</line>
      <line>Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I was a traveller then upon the moor:</line>
      <line>I saw the hare that raced about with joy,</line>
      <line>I heard the woods and distant waters roar –</line>
      <line>Or heard them not – as happy as a boy;</line>
      <line>The pleasant season did my heart employ;</line>
      <line>My old remembrances went from me wholly,</line>
      <line>And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, as it sometimes chanceth – from the might</line>
      <line>Of joy in minds that can no farther go –</line>
      <line>As high as we have mounted in delight</line>
      <line> In our dejection do we sink as low.</line>
      <line>To me that morning did it happen so,</line>
      <line>And fears and fancies thick upon me came:</line>
      <line>Dim sadness, and blind thoughts I knew not, nor could name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I heard the skylark singing in the sky</line>
      <line>And I bethought me of the playful hare:</line>
      <line>‘Even such a happy child of earth am I –</line>
      <line>Even as these blissful creatures do I fare!</line>
      <line>Far from the world I walk, and from all care;</line>
      <line>But there may come another day to me</line>
      <line> Solitude, pain of heart, distress and poverty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My whole life have I lived in pleasant thought</line>
      <line>As if life’s business were a summer mood,</line>
      <line>As if all needful things would come unsought</line>
      <line>To genial faith, still rich in genial good –</line>
      <line>But how can he expect that others should</line>
      <line>Build for him, sow for him, and at his call</line>
      <line>Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I thought of Chatterton – the marvellous boy,</line>
      <line>The sleepless soul that perished in its pride –</line>
      <line> Of him who walked in glory and in joy</line>
      <line>Behind his plough upon the mountain’s side.</line>
      <line>By our own spirits are we deified!</line>
      <line>We poets in our youth begin in gladness,</line>
      <line>But thereof comes in the end despondency and madness.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, whether it were by peculiar grace</line>
      <line>(A leading from above, a something given),</line>
      <line>Yet it befell that in this lonely place</line>
      <line>When up and down my fancy thus was driven,</line>
      <line>And I with these untoward thoughts had striven,</line>
      <line> I saw a man before me unawares;</line>
      <line>The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My course I stopped as soon as I espied</line>
      <line>The old man in that naked wilderness;</line>
      <line>Close by a pond – upon the further side –</line>
      <line>He stood alone a minute’s space, I guess.</line>
      <line>I watched him, he continuing motionless;</line>
      <line>To the pool’s further margin then I drew,</line>
      <line>He being all the while before me full in view.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie</line>
      <line> Couched on the bald top of an eminence</line>
      <line>(Wonder to all who do the same espy</line>
      <line>By what means it could thither come, and whence)</line>
      <line>So that it seems a thing endued with sense,</line>
      <line>Like a sea-beast crawled forth, which on a shelf</line>
      <line>Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself–</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such seemed this man, not all alive nor dead,</line>
      <line>Nor all asleep, in his extreme old age.</line>
      <line>His body was bent double, feet and head</line>
      <line>Coming together in their pilgrimage</line>
      <line> As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage</line>
      <line>Of sickness, felt by him in times long past,</line>
      <line>A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Himself he propped – his body, limbs, and face –</line>
      <line>Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood;</line>
      <line>And still, as I drew near with gentle pace,</line>
      <line>Beside the little pond or moorish flood</line>
      <line>Motionless as a cloud the old man stood,</line>
      <line>That heareth not the loud winds when they call,</line>
      <line>And moveth altogether, if it move at all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> At length – himself unsettling – he the pond</line>
      <line>Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look</line>
      <line>Upon the muddy water which he conned</line>
      <line>As if he had been reading in a book;</line>
      <line>And now such freedom as I could I took</line>
      <line>And, drawing to his side, to him did say,</line>
      <line>‘This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A gentle answer did the old man make</line>
      <line>In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew,</line>
      <line>And him with further words I thus bespake:</line>
      <line> ‘What kind of work is that which you pursue? –</line>
      <line>This is a lonesome place for one like you.’</line>
      <line>He answered me with pleasure and surprise,</line>
      <line>And there was, while he spake, a fire about his eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His words came feebly from a feeble chest,</line>
      <line>Yet each in solemn order followed each</line>
      <line>With something of a lofty utterance dressed –</line>
      <line>Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach</line>
      <line>Of ordinary men – a stately speech</line>
      <line>Such as grave livers do in Scotland use,</line>
      <line>Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He told me that he to this pond had come</line>
      <line>To gather leeches, being old and poor</line>
      <line>(Employment hazardous and wearisome!)</line>
      <line>And he had many hardships to endure.</line>
      <line>From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor,</line>
      <line>Housing, with God’s good help, by choice or chance;</line>
      <line>And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The old man still stood talking at my side,</line>
      <line>But now his voice to me was like a stream</line>
      <line> Scarce heard – nor word from word could I divide –</line>
      <line>And the whole body of the man did seem</line>
      <line>Like one whom I had met with in a dream,</line>
      <line>Or like a man from some far region sent</line>
      <line>To give me human strength, and strong admonishment.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills,</line>
      <line>The hope that is unwilling to be fed –</line>
      <line>Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills,</line>
      <line>And mighty poets in their misery dead.</line>
      <line>And now, not knowing what the old man had said,</line>
      <line> My question eagerly did I renew:</line>
      <line>‘How is it that you live, and what is it you do?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He with a smile did then his words repeat,</line>
      <line>And said that, gathering leeches far and wide</line>
      <line>He travelled, stirring thus about his feet</line>
      <line>The waters of the ponds where they abide:</line>
      <line>‘Once I could meet with them on every side,</line>
      <line>But they have dwindled long by slow decay;</line>
      <line>Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While he was talking thus, the lonely place,</line>
      <line> The old man’s shape and speech, all troubled me;</line>
      <line>In my mind’s eye I seemed to see him pace</line>
      <line>About the weary moors continually,</line>
      <line>Wandering about alone and silently.</line>
      <line>While I these thoughts within myself pursued,</line>
      <line>He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And soon with this he other matter blended –</line>
      <line>Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,</line>
      <line>But stately in the main – and when he ended</line>
      <line>I could have laughed myself to scorn to find</line>
      <line> In that decrepit man so firm a mind.</line>
      <line>‘God’, said I, ‘be my help and stay secure,</line>
      <line>I’ll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!’</line>

    <title>The London Beggar</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>How often in the overflowing streets</line>
      <line> Have I gone forwards with the crowd, and said</line>
      <line>Unto myself ‘The face of everyone</line>
      <line>That passes by me is a mystery!’</line>
      <line>Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed</line>
      <line>By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,</line>
      <line>Until the shapes before my eyes became</line>
      <line>A second-sight procession such as glides</line>
      <line>Over still mountains, or appears in dreams,</line>
      <line>And all the ballast of familiar life</line>
      <line>(The present and the past, hope, fear, all stays –</line>
      <line>All laws – of acting, thinking, speaking man)</line>
      <line>Went from me, neither knowing me, nor known.</line>
      <line>And once, far travelled in such mood, beyond</line>
      <line>The reach of common indications, lost</line>
      <line>Amid the moving pageant, ’twas my chance</line>
      <line>Abruptly to be smitten with the view</line>
      <line>Of a blind beggar, who, with upright face,</line>
      <line>Stood propped against a wall, upon his chest</line>
      <line>Wearing a written paper to explain</line>
      <line>The story of the man, and who he was.</line>
      <line> My mind did at this spectacle turn round</line>
      <line>As with the might of waters, and it seemed</line>
      <line>To me that in this label was a type</line>
      <line>Or emblem of the utmost that we know</line>
      <line>Both of ourselves and of the universe.</line>
      <line>And on the shape of this unmoving man,</line>
      <line>His fixéd face and sightless eyes, I looked</line>
      <line>As if admonished from another world.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>It is an ancyent Marinere,</line>
      <line>And he stoppeth one of three:</line>

      <line>Now wherefore stoppest me?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The Bridegroom’s doors are opened wide</line>

      <line>May’st hear the merry din.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But still he holds the wedding-guest –</line>
      <line>'There was a Ship’, quoth he –</line>

      <line>Marinere! come with me.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He holds him with his skinny hand,</line>
      <line>Quoth he, ‘There was a Ship’ –</line>
      <line> ‘Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!</line>
      <line>Or my Staff shall make thee skip.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He holds him with his glittering eye –</line>
      <line>The wedding guest stood still</line>
      <line>And listens like a three year’s child;</line>
      <line>The Marinere hath his will.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wedding-guest sate on a stone,</line>
      <line>He cannot chuse but hear –</line>

      <line>The bright-eyed Marinere:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘The Ship was cheered, the Harbour cleared –</line>
      <line>Merrily did we drop</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The Sun came up upon the left,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Higher and higher every day,</line>
      <line>Till over the mast at noon’ –</line>
      <line> The wedding-guest here beat his breast,</line>
      <line>For he heard the loud bassoon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Bride hath paced into the Hall,</line>
      <line>Red as a rose is she;</line>

      <line>The merry Minstralsy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wedding-guest he beat his breast,</line>
      <line>Yet he cannot chuse but hear –</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,</line>
      <line>And it grew wondrous cauld:</line>

      <line>As green as Emerauld.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And through the drifts the snowy clifts</line>
      <line>Did send a dismal sheen;</line>
      <line> Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken –</line>
      <line>The Ice was all between.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Ice was here, the Ice was there,</line>
      <line>The Ice was all around:</line>
      <line>It cracked and growled, and roared and howled –</line>
      <line>Like noises of a swound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length did cross an Albatross,</line>
      <line>Thorough the Fog it came;</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,</line>

      <line>Ne dim ne red, like God’s own head,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The breezes blew, the white foam flew,</line>

      <line>Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>All in a hot and copper sky</line>
      <line>The bloody sun at noon,</line>
      <line>Right up above the mast did stand,</line>

      <line>Day after day, day after day,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The very deeps did rot: O Christ!</line>

      <line>“Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look”,</line>
      <line>The Pilot made reply,</line>

      <line>Said the Hermit cheerily.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> The Boat came closer to the Ship,</line>
      <line>But I ne spake ne stirred!</line>
      <line>The Boat came close beneath the Ship,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Under the water it rumbled on,</line>
      <line>Still louder and more dread:</line>
      <line>It reached the Ship, it split the bay;</line>
      <line>The Ship went down like lead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,</line>
      <line>Which sky and ocean smote,</line>
      <line> Like one that hath been seven days drowned</line>
      <line>My body lay afloat,</line>
      <line>But, swift as dreams, myself I found</line>
      <line>Within the Pilot’s boat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,</line>
      <line>The boat spun round and round;</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I moved my lips; the Pilot shrieked</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I took the oars – the Pilot’s boy,</line>
      <line>Who now doth crazy go,</line>
      <line>Laughed loud and long, and all the while</line>
      <line>His eyes went to and fro:</line>

      <line>“O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!”</line>
      <line>The Hermit crossed his brow –</line>

      <line>What manner of man art thou?”</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched</line>

    <title>Pains of Sleep</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ere on my bed my limbs I lay,</line>
      <line>It hath not been my use to pray</line>
      <line>With moving lips or bended knees;</line>
      <line>But silently, by slow degrees,</line>
      <line> My spirit I to love compose,</line>
      <line>In humble trust mine eyelids close</line>
      <line>With reverential resignation,</line>
      <line>No wish conceived, no thought expressed,</line>
      <line>Only a sense of supplication –</line>
      <line>A sense o’er all my soul impressed</line>
      <line>That I am weak, yet not unblest,</line>
      <line>Since in me, round me, everywhere</line>
      <line>Eternal Strength and Wisdom are.</line>
      <line>But yester-night I prayed aloud</line>
      <line> In anguish and in agony,</line>
      <line>Upstarting from the fiendish crowd</line>
      <line>Of shapes and thoughts that tortured me:</line>
      <line>A lurid light, a trampling throng,</line>
      <line>Sense of intolerable wrong,</line>
      <line>And whom I scorned, those only strong –</line>
      <line>Thirst of revenge, the powerless will</line>
      <line>Still baffled, and yet burning still!</line>
      <line>Desire with loathing strangely mixed</line>
      <line>On wild or hateful objects fixed!</line>
      <line> Fantastic passions! maddening brawl!</line>
      <line>And shame and terror over all!</line>
      <line>Deeds to be hid which were not hid,</line>
      <line>Which all confused I could not know</line>
      <line>Whether I suffered, or I did;</line>
      <line>For all seemed guilt, remorse or woe –</line>
      <line>My own or others’ – still the same</line>
      <line>Life-stifling fear, soul-stifling shame!</line>
      <line>So two nights passed. The night’s dismay</line>
      <line>Saddened and stunned the coming day:</line>
      <line> Sleep, the wide blessing, seemed to me</line>
      <line>Distemper’s worst calamity.</line>
      <line>The third night, when my own loud scream</line>
      <line>Had waked me from the fiendish dream,</line>
      <line>O’ercome with sufferings strange and wild</line>
      <line>I wept as I had been a child;</line>
      <line>And having thus by tears subdued</line>
      <line>My anguish to a milder mood,</line>
      <line>Such punishments, I said, were due</line>
      <line>To natures deepliest stained with sin</line>
      <line> (For aye entempesting anew</line>
      <line>The unfathomable Hell within),</line>
      <line>The horror of their deeds to view,</line>
      <line>To know and loathe, yet wish and do!</line>
      <line>Such griefs with such men well agree,</line>
      <line>But wherefore, wherefore fall on me?</line>
      <line>To be beloved is all I need,</line>
      <line>And whom I love, I love indeed.</line>

      <line>Three days we’ve fled together,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> For sore dismayed, through storm and shade,</line>
      <line>His child he did discover:</line>

    <title>The Visit</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘Here’, said my guide,</line>
      <line>‘The poor crazed inmates of yon mansion stray;</line>
      <line>Their keepers watch their moody wanderings,</line>
      <line>Yet oft in these wild heights unseen they lurk</line>
      <line>Eluding all research.’ I trembled at the tale –</line>
      <line>Oh frightful haunts! – lest a strange form,</line>
      <line>With sudden rage and demon strength possessed,</line>
      <line>Swift from yon jutting crag with fell intent</line>
      <line>And horrid yell might rush, and hurl me down</line>
      <line>The immense below. Urged by these terrors, soon</line>
      <line> We gained the sullen dwelling – drear retreat!</line>
      <line>The massy doors, the iron-grated lights,</line>
      <line>Appalled with very strength – I trembled there</line>
      <line>E’en in the terrible security.</line>
      <line>Then fearful wrecks of storms I ill endured</line>
      <line>Unmeet to greet a sympathizing guest:</line>
      <line>The shriek, the long loud laugh, the desperate din</line>
      <line>I scarce forbore to join. I clasped my dewy brows</line>
      <line>Insensate of the pressure, chilling cold.</line>
      <line>I thought, ‘Or death, or madness, soon will seize</line>
      <line> My trembling frame, and I shall never more</line>
      <line>Behold aught fair, or good, or blest, or dear.’</line>
      <line>Instant I clasped them all! Oh, what a change</line>
      <line>To love, and hope, and joy, one tender look –</line>
      <line>One precious word of recognition – gave!</line>
      <line>Now, all her own sweet self in loveliness</line>
      <line>(Restored by kindest care, and medicinal aid),</line>
      <line>I saw my gentle friend – mutual surprise</line>
      <line>Of unexpected bliss! Enquiry o’er,</line>
      <line>And calmed the sudden joy, ‘’Tis years’, she said,</line>
      <line> ‘Dark years, since we have met – dark years of grief –</line>
      <line>And dark the future too – but these will pass,</line>
      <line>These too will pass, and so we’ll meet in Heaven.</line>
      <line>Nay, here we’ll meet if, kind, my soon return</line>
      <line>Thou’lt wait amongst our native bowers – shelters</line>
      <line>From many a storm, when, rambling far, we saw</line>
      <line>The gathering clouds with fear – fond maids! – nor shunned</line>
      <line>The darker storms that early whelmed us o’er.</line>
      <line>One more request, and we will say farewell</line>
      <line>Lest night o’ertake thee.</line>
      <line>Dost thou remember,</line>
      <line> Six years ago (past a few warmer suns</line>
      <line>To give the summer ripeness) one evening</line>
      <line>We lingered in the copse, plucking wild flowers</line>
      <line>To weave us wreathes beseeming more, we said,</line>
      <line>The brows of simple maids, than garden flowers</line>
      <line>Flaunting so proud in artificial hues.</line>
      <line>Capricious idlers! so we moralized,</line>
      <line>‘And this, for one afar!’ you cried, bending</line>
      <line>A pliant branch, on whose high top you hung</line>
      <line>A varied garland. Withdrawn the gentle force,</line>
      <line> Upsprung in air it waved its modest tints</line>
      <line>So prettily, we, smiling, marked the while</line>
      <line>’Till, roused by distant sounds threatening and rude,</line>
      <line>We turned, and, through the mazy thicket</line>
      <line>(Every repelling branch or bent, or torn),</line>
      <line>Heedless of hurt, a tattered creature, wild,</line>
      <line>Haggard and wan, pressed on to where we stood</line>
      <line>Silent and still with fear – nor time for flight!</line>
      <line>In wrathful mood mad Kattern hailed us loud,</line>
      <line>Then you, with feigned composure, forward stepped:</line>
      <line>“This to Kate – sweet flowers for her! Does any</line>
      <line>Harm poor Kate – aught ail her?” Relenting, pleased,</line>
      <line>She took the fragrant gift, muttered and passed.</line>
      <line>Poor Kate, rude boys had worried her to rage –</line>
      <line>Harmless else, and sometimes happy too, for</line>
      <line>Kate had long forgotten him who wronged her.</line>
      <line>Blest forgetfulness! Oh falsest man,</line>
      <line>Forgetting thee!’</line>
      <line>Then in those softest eyes</line>
      <line>Gleamed wandering fires – fires not their own – but soon</line>
      <line>To tears they changed. ‘How much’, she said, ‘in fond</line>
      <line> And idle talk I, wandering, lose myself,</line>
      <line>Detaining thee. Tomorrow at this hour</line>
      <line>Cross that low copse, and climb the ascent beyond,</line>
      <line>So gay with yellow broom and purple heath;</line>
      <line>I to yon sullen heights will bend my way,</line>
      <line>And, if the day is fair, I have a glass</line>
      <line>Will show thee there – thy white kerchief waving.</line>
      <line>Though indistinct thy form I see, this sign</line>
      <line>Will mark it thine – sweet consciousness! Again</line>
      <line>Each day, return – the dearest hour I’ll know</line>
      <line> Till that I meet thee there! Farewell, farewell!’</line>
      <line>‘Each word of thine is treasured – oh, farewell!’</line>

    <title>The Prisoner of Chillon</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>My hair is grey, but not with years –</line>
      <line>Nor grew it white</line>
      <line>In a single night,</line>
      <line>As men’s have grown from sudden fears;</line>
      <line> My limbs are bowed, though not with toil</line>
      <line>But rusted with a vile repose,</line>
      <line>For they have been a dungeon’s spoil,</line>
      <line>And mine has been the fate of those</line>
      <line>To whom the goodly earth and air</line>
      <line>Are banned, and barred – forbidden fare!</line>
      <line>But this was for my father’s faith</line>
      <line>I suffered chains and courted death –</line>
      <line>That father perished at the stake</line>
      <line>For tenets he would not forsake,</line>
      <line> And for the same his lineal race</line>
      <line>In darkness found a dwelling place!</line>
      <line>We were seven, who now are one:</line>
      <line>Six in youth, and one in age,</line>
      <line>Finished as they had begun,</line>
      <line>Proud of Persecution’s rage.</line>
      <line>One in fire, and two in field,</line>
      <line>Their belief with blood have sealed,</line>
      <line>Dying as their father died,</line>
      <line>For the God their foes denied;</line>
      <line> Three were in a dungeon cast,</line>
      <line>Of whom this wreck is left the last!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There are seven pillars of gothic mould</line>
      <line>In Chillon’s dungeons deep and old,</line>
      <line>There are seven columns, massy and grey,</line>
      <line>Dim with a dull imprisoned ray</line>
      <line>(A sunbeam which hath lost its way,</line>
      <line>And through the crevice and the cleft</line>
      <line>Of the thick wall is fallen and left,</line>
      <line>Creeping o’er the floor so damp,</line>
      <line> Like a marsh’s meteor lamp),</line>
      <line>And in each pillar there is a ring,</line>
      <line>And in each ring there is a chain –</line>
      <line>That iron is a cankering thing,</line>
      <line>For in these limbs its teeth remain,</line>
      <line>With marks that will not wear away,</line>
      <line>Till I have done with this new day,</line>
      <line>Which now is painful to these eyes</line>
      <line>Which have not seen the sun so rise</line>
      <line>For years – I cannot count them o’er,</line>
      <line> I lost their long and heavy score</line>
      <line>When my last brother drooped and died,</line>
      <line>And I lay living by his side.</line>
      <line>They chained us each to a column-stone,</line>
      <line>And we were three – yet, each alone!</line>
      <line>We could not move a single pace,</line>
      <line>We could not see each other’s face</line>
      <line>But with that pale and livid light</line>
      <line>That made us strangers in our sight:</line>
      <line>And thus together – yet apart –</line>
      <line> Fettered in hand but joined in heart,</line>
      <line>’Twas still some solace in the dearth</line>
      <line>Of the pure elements of earth,</line>
      <line>To hearken to each other’s speech,</line>
      <line>And each turn comforter to each</line>
      <line>With some new hope, or legend old,</line>
      <line>Or song heroically bold –</line>
      <line>But even these at length grew cold.</line>
      <line>Our voices took a dreary tone,</line>
      <line>An echo of the dungeon-stone,</line>
      <line> A grating sound, not full and free</line>
      <line>As they of yore were wont to be –</line>
      <line>It might be fancy, but to me</line>
      <line>They never sounded like our own!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I was the eldest of the three,</line>
      <line>And to uphold and cheer the rest</line>
      <line>I ought to do – and did my best –</line>
      <line>And each did well in his degree.</line>
      <line>The youngest, whom my father loved,</line>
      <line>Because our mother’s brow was given</line>
      <line> To him, with eyes as blue as heaven –</line>
      <line>For him my soul was sorely moved.</line>
      <line>And truly might it be distressed</line>
      <line>To see such bird in such a nest;</line>
      <line>For he was beautiful as day –</line>
      <line>When day was beautiful to me</line>
      <line>As to young eagles, being free –</line>
      <line>A polar day, which will not see</line>
      <line>A sunset till its summer’s gone,</line>
      <line>Its sleepless summer of long light,</line>
      <line> The snow-clad offspring of the sun!</line>
      <line>And thus he was as pure and bright,</line>
      <line>And in his natural spirit gay,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With tears for nought but others’ ills –</line>
      <line>And then they flowed like mountain-rills,</line>
      <line>Unless he could assuage the woe</line>
      <line>Which he abhorred to view below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The other was as pure of mind,</line>
      <line>But formed to combat with his kind:</line>
      <line>Strong in his frame, and of a mood</line>
      <line> Which ’gainst the world in war had stood,</line>
      <line>And perished in the foremost rank</line>
      <line>With joy – but not in chains to pine!</line>
      <line>His spirit withered with their clank,</line>
      <line>I saw it silently decline</line>
      <line>(And so perchance in sooth did mine,</line>
      <line>But yet I forced it on to cheer</line>
      <line>Those relics of a home so dear).</line>
      <line>He was a hunter of the hills,</line>
      <line>Had followed there the deer and wolf;</line>
      <line>To him this dungeon was a gulf,</line>
      <line>And fettered feet the worst of ills.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lake Leman lies by Chillon’s walls:</line>
      <line>A thousand feet in depth below</line>
      <line>Its massy waters meet and flow –</line>
      <line>Thus much the fathom-line was sent</line>
      <line>From Chillon’s snow-white battlement,</line>
      <line>Which round about the wave enthralls!</line>
      <line>A double dungeon wall and wave</line>
      <line>Have made – and like a living grave.</line>
      <line> Below the surface of the lake</line>
      <line>The dark vault lies wherein we lay –</line>
      <line>We heard it ripple night and day –</line>
      <line>Sounding o’er our heads it knocked,</line>
      <line>And I have felt the winter’s spray</line>
      <line>Wash through the bars when winds were high</line>
      <line>And wanton in the happy sky;</line>
      <line>And then the very rock hath rocked,</line>
      <line>And I have felt it shake, unshocked,</line>
      <line>Because I could have smiled to see</line>
      <line> The death that would have set me free.</line>
      <line>I said my nearer brother pined,</line>
      <line>I said his mighty heart declined,</line>
      <line>He loathed and put away his food –</line>
      <line>It was not that ’twas coarse and rude,</line>
      <line>For we were used to hunter’s fare</line>
      <line>And for the like had little care:</line>
      <line>The milk drawn from the mountain-goat</line>
      <line>Was changed for water from the moat,</line>
      <line>Our bread was such as captives’ tears</line>
      <line> Have moistened many a thousand years</line>
      <line>Since man first pent his fellow men</line>
      <line>Like brutes within an iron den –</line>
      <line>But what were these to us or him?</line>
      <line>These wasted not his heart or limb!</line>
      <line>My brother’s soul was of that mould</line>
      <line>Which in a palace had grown cold</line>
      <line>Had his free breathing been denied</line>
      <line>The range of the steep mountain’s side –</line>
      <line>But why delay the truth? He died.</line>
      <line> I saw, and could not hold his head,</line>
      <line>Nor reach his dying hand – nor dead,</line>
      <line>Though hard I strove (but strove in vain)</line>
      <line>To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.</line>
      <line>He died – and they unlocked his chain</line>
      <line>And scooped for him a shallow grave</line>
      <line>Even from the cold earth of our cave.</line>
      <line>I begged them, as a boon, to lay</line>
      <line>His corse in dust whereon the day</line>
      <line>Might shine – it was a foolish thought,</line>
      <line> But then within my brain it wrought</line>
      <line>That even in death his freeborn breast</line>
      <line>In such a dungeon could not rest.</line>
      <line>I might have spared my idle prayer –</line>
      <line>They coldly laughed, and laid him there:</line>
      <line>The flat and turfless earth above</line>
      <line>The being we so much did love.</line>
      <line>His empty chain above it leant –</line>
      <line>Such murder’s fitting monument!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But he, the favourite and the flower,</line>
      <line> Most cherished since his natal hour,</line>
      <line>His mother’s image in fair face,</line>
      <line>The infant love of all his race,</line>
      <line>His martyred father’s dearest thought,</line>
      <line>My latest care (for whom I sought</line>
      <line>To hoard my life, that his might be</line>
      <line>Less wretched now, and one day free) –</line>
      <line>He, too, who yet had held untired</line>
      <line>A spirit natural or inspired –</line>
      <line>He, too, was struck, and day by day</line>
      <line> Was withered on the stalk away.</line>
      <line>Oh, God! it is a fearful thing</line>
      <line>To see the human soul take wing</line>
      <line>In any shape, in any mood:</line>
      <line>I’ve seen it rushing forth in blood,</line>
      <line>I’ve seen it on the breaking ocean</line>
      <line>Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,</line>
      <line>I’ve seen the sick and ghastly bed</line>
      <line>Of sin, delirious with its dread.</line>
      <line>But these were horrors – this was woe</line>
      <line> Unmixed with such – but sure and slow.</line>
      <line>He faded, and so calm and meek,</line>
      <line>So softly worn, so sweetly weak,</line>
      <line>So tearless, yet so tender – kind,</line>
      <line>And grieved for those he left behind;</line>
      <line>With all the while a cheek whose bloom</line>
      <line>Was as a mockery of the tomb,</line>
      <line>Whose tints as gently sunk away</line>
      <line>As a departing rainbow’s ray;</line>
      <line>An eye of most transparent light,</line>
      <line> That almost made the dungeon bright;</line>
      <line>And not a word of murmur, not</line>
      <line>A groan o’er his untimely lot –</line>
      <line>A little talk of better days,</line>
      <line>A little hope my own to raise,</line>
      <line>For I was sunk in silence, lost</line>
      <line>In this last loss, of all the most.</line>
      <line>And then the sighs he would suppress</line>
      <line>Of fainting Nature’s feebleness,</line>
      <line>More slowly drawn, grew less and less:</line>
      <line>I listened, but I could not hear;</line>
      <line>I called, for I was wild with fear;</line>
      <line>I knew ’twas hopeless, but my dread</line>
      <line>Would not be thus admonishéd.</line>
      <line>I called, and thought I heard a sound –</line>
      <line>I burst my chain with one strong bound,</line>
      <line>And rushed to him! I found him not!</line>
      <line>I only stirred in this black spot,</line>
      <line>I only lived, I only drew</line>
      <line>The accurséd breath of dungeon-dew –</line>
      <line> The last, the sole, the dearest link</line>
      <line>Between me and the eternal brink,</line>
      <line>Which bound me to my failing race,</line>
      <line>Was broken in this fatal place.</line>
      <line>One on the earth, and one beneath –</line>
      <line>My brothers – both had ceased to breathe.</line>
      <line>I took that hand which lay so still</line>
      <line>(Alas, my own was full as chill),</line>
      <line>I had not strength to stir, or strive,</line>
      <line>But felt that I was still alive –</line>
      <line> A frantic feeling, when we know</line>
      <line>That what we love shall ne’er be so.</line>
      <line>I know not why</line>
      <line>I could not die;</line>
      <line>I had no earthly hope – but faith,</line>
      <line>And that forbade a selfish death.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What next befell me then and there</line>
      <line>I know not well – I never knew –</line>
      <line>First came the loss of light, and air,</line>
      <line>And then of darkness too!</line>
      <line> I had no thought, no feeling – none –</line>
      <line>Among the stones I stood a stone,</line>
      <line>And was (scarce conscious what I wist)</line>
      <line>As shrubless crags within the mist.</line>
      <line>For all was blank, and bleak, and grey:</line>
      <line>It was not night – it was not day,</line>
      <line>It was not even the dungeon-light,</line>
      <line>So hateful to my heavy sight,</line>
      <line>But vacancy absorbing space,</line>
      <line>And fixédness, without a place!</line>
      <line> There were no stars, no earth, no time,</line>
      <line>No check, no change, no good, no crime –</line>
      <line>But silence, and a stirless breath</line>
      <line>Which neither was of life nor death:</line>
      <line>A sea of stagnant idleness,</line>
      <line>Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!</line>
      <line>A light broke in upon my brain,</line>
      <line>It was the carol of a bird –</line>
      <line>It ceased, and then it came again,</line>
      <line>The sweetest song ear ever heard,</line>
      <line> And mine was thankful till my eyes</line>
      <line>Ran over with the glad surprise,</line>
      <line>And they that moment could not see</line>
      <line>I was the mate of misery!</line>
      <line>But then by dull degrees came back</line>
      <line>My senses to their wonted track;</line>
      <line>I saw the dungeon-walls and floor</line>
      <line>Close slowly round me as before;</line>
      <line>I saw the glimmer of the sun</line>
      <line>Creeping as it before had done,</line>
      <line> But through the crevice where it came</line>
      <line>That bird was perched, as fond and tame,</line>
      <line>And tamer than upon the tree –</line>
      <line>A lovely bird, with azure wings</line>
      <line>And song that said a thousand things,</line>
      <line>And seemed to say them all for me!</line>
      <line>I never saw its like before,</line>
      <line>I ne’er shall see its likeness more:</line>
      <line>It seemed like me to want a mate,</line>
      <line>But was not half so desolate,</line>
      <line> And it was come to love me when</line>
      <line>None lived to love me so again,</line>
      <line>And cheering from my dungeon’s brink,</line>
      <line>Had brought me back to feel and think.</line>
      <line>I know not if it late were free,</line>
      <line>Or broke its cage to perch on mine,</line>
      <line>But knowing well captivity,</line>
      <line>Sweet bird, I could not wish for thine!</line>
      <line>Or if it were, in wingéd guise,</line>
      <line>A visitant from Paradise;</line>
      <line> For (Heaven forgive that thought, the while</line>
      <line>Which made me both to weep and smile)</line>
      <line>I sometimes deemed that it might be</line>
      <line>My brother’s soul come down to me!</line>
      <line>But then at last away it flew,</line>
      <line>And then ’twas mortal well I knew,</line>
      <line>For he would never thus have flown</line>
      <line>And left me twice so doubly lone –</line>
      <line>Lone as the corse within its shroud,</line>
      <line>Lone as a solitary cloud,</line>
      <line> A single cloud on a sunny day,</line>
      <line>While all the rest of heaven is clear,</line>
      <line>A frown upon the atmosphere</line>
      <line>That hath no business to appear</line>
      <line>When skies are blue, and earth is gay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A kind of change came in my fate,</line>
      <line>My keepers grew compassionate;</line>
      <line>I know not what had made them so</line>
      <line>(They were inured to sights of woe),</line>
      <line>But so it was – my broken chain</line>
      <line>With links unfastened did remain,</line>
      <line>And it was liberty to stride</line>
      <line>Along my cell from side to side,</line>
      <line>And up and down, and then athwart,</line>
      <line>And tread it over every part;</line>
      <line>And round the pillars one by one,</line>
      <line>Returning where my walk begun,</line>
      <line>Avoiding only, as I trod,</line>
      <line>My brothers’ graves without a sod;</line>
      <line>For if I thought with heedless tread</line>
      <line> My step profaned their lowly bed,</line>
      <line>My breath came gaspingly and thick,</line>
      <line>And my crushed heart felt blind and sick.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I made a footing in the wall –</line>
      <line>It was not therefrom to escape,</line>
      <line>For I had buried one and all</line>
      <line>Who loved me in a human shape,</line>
      <line>And the whole earth would henceforth be</line>
      <line>A wider prison unto me!</line>
      <line>No child, no sire, no kin had I,</line>
      <line> No partner in my misery;</line>
      <line>I thought of this, and I was glad,</line>
      <line>For thought of them had made me mad;</line>
      <line>But I was curious to ascend</line>
      <line>To my barred windows, and to bend</line>
      <line>Once more, upon the mountains high,</line>
      <line>The quiet of a loving eye.</line>
      <line>I saw them – and they were the same,</line>
      <line>They were not changed like me in frame;</line>
      <line>I saw their thousand years of snow</line>
      <line> On high – their wide long lake below,</line>
      <line>And the blue Rhone in fullest flow!</line>
      <line>I heard the torrents leap and gush</line>
      <line>O’er channelled rock and broken bush;</line>
      <line>I saw the white-walled distant town,</line>
      <line>And whiter sails go skimming down;</line>
      <line>And then there was a little isle,</line>
      <line>Which in my very face did smile,</line>
      <line>The only one in view –</line>
      <line>A small green isle, it seemed no more,</line>
      <line> Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,</line>
      <line>But in it there were three tall trees,</line>
      <line>And o’er it blew the mountain-breeze,</line>
      <line>And by it there were waters flowing,</line>
      <line>And on it there were young flowers growing,</line>
      <line>Of gentle breath and hue.</line>
      <line>The fish swam by the castle wall,</line>
      <line>And they seemed joyous each and all;</line>
      <line>The eagle rode the rising blast,</line>
      <line>Methought he never flew so fast</line>
      <line> As then to me he seemed to fly!</line>
      <line>And then new tears came in my eye,</line>
      <line>And I felt troubled – and would fain</line>
      <line>I had not left my recent chain;</line>
      <line>And when I did descend again,</line>
      <line>The darkness of my dim abode</line>
      <line>Fell on me as a heavy load.</line>
      <line>It was as is a new-dug grave,</line>
      <line>Closing o’er one we sought to save –</line>
      <line>And yet my glance, too much opprest,</line>
      <line> Had almost need of such a rest.</line>
      <line>It might be months, or years, or days</line>
      <line>(I kept no count, I took no note,</line>
      <line>I had no hope my eyes to raise,</line>
      <line>And clear them of their dreary mote),</line>
      <line>At last men came to set me free.</line>
      <line>I asked not why, and recked not where;</line>
      <line>It was at length the same to me,</line>
      <line>Fettered or fetterless to be –</line>
      <line>I learned to love despair!</line>
      <line> And thus when they appeared at last,</line>
      <line>And all my bonds aside were cast,</line>
      <line>These heavy walls to me had grown</line>
      <line>A hermitage – and all my own!</line>
      <line>And half I felt as they were come</line>
      <line>To tear me from a second home:</line>
      <line>With spiders I had friendship made,</line>
      <line>And watched them in their sullen trade,</line>
      <line>Had seen the mice by moonlight play,</line>
      <line>And why should I feel less than they?</line>
      <line> We were all inmates of one place,</line>
      <line>And I, the monarch of each race,</line>
      <line>Had power to kill – yet, strange to tell</line>
      <line>In quiet we had learned to dwell.</line>
      <line>My very chains and I grew friends,</line>
      <line>So much a long communion tends</line>
      <line>To make us what we are – even, I</line>
      <line>Regained my freedom with a sigh.</line>

    <date>1818</date>
    <title>from Isabella, or The Pot of Basil</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In the mid-days of autumn, on their eves,</line>
      <line>The breath of Winter comes from far away,</line>
      <line>And the sick west continually bereaves</line>
      <line>Of some bold tinge, and plays a roundelay</line>
      <line>Of death among the bushes and the leaves,</line>
      <line>To make all bare before he dares to stray</line>
      <line> From his north cavern. So sweet Isabel</line>
      <line>By gradual decay from beauty fell,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Because Lorenzo came not. Oftentimes</line>
      <line>She asked her brothers, with an eye all pale,</line>
      <line>Striving to be itself, what dungeon-climes</line>
      <line>Could keep him off so long? They spake a tale</line>
      <line>Time after time, to quiet her. Their crimes</line>
      <line>Came on them, like a smoke from Hinnom’s vale;</line>
      <line>And every night in dreams they groaned aloud,</line>
      <line>To see their sister in her snowy shroud.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And she had died in drowsy ignorance,</line>
      <line>But for a thing more deadly dark than all –</line>
      <line>It came like a fierce potion, drunk by chance,</line>
      <line>Which saves a sick man from the feathered pall</line>
      <line>For some few gasping moments – like a lance,</line>
      <line>Waking an Indian from his cloudy hall</line>
      <line>With cruel pierce, and bringing him again</line>
      <line>Sense of the gnawing fire at heart and brain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was a vision: in the drowsy gloom,</line>
      <line>The dull of midnight, at her couch’s foot</line>
      <line> Lorenzo stood, and wept. The forest tomb</line>
      <line>Had marred his glossy hair which once could shoot</line>
      <line>Lustre into the sun, and put cold doom</line>
      <line>Upon his lips, and taken the soft lute</line>
      <line>From his lorn voice, and past his loaméd ears</line>
      <line>Had made a miry channel for his tears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Strange sound it was when the pale shadow spake,</line>
      <line>For there was striving in its piteous tongue</line>
      <line>To speak as when on earth it was awake –</line>
      <line>And Isabella on its music hung.</line>
      <line> Languor there was in it, and tremulous shake,</line>
      <line>As in a palsied Druid’s harp unstrung;</line>
      <line>And through it moaned a ghostly under-song,</line>
      <line>Like hoarse night-gusts sepulchral briars among.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Its eyes, though wild, were still all dewy bright</line>
      <line>With love, and kept all phantom fear aloof</line>
      <line>From the poor girl by magic of their light,</line>
      <line>The while it did unthread the horrid woof</line>
      <line>Of the late darkened time – the murderous spite</line>
      <line>Of pride and avarice – the dark pine roof</line>
      <line> In the forest – and the sodden turféd-dell,</line>
      <line>Where, without any word, from stabs he fell –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Saying moreover, ‘Isabel, my sweet!</line>
      <line>Red whortle-berries droop above my head,</line>
      <line>And a large flint-stone weighs upon my feet;</line>
      <line>Around me beeches and high chestnuts shed</line>
      <line>Their leaves and prickly nuts; a sheepfold-bleat</line>
      <line>Comes from beyond the river to my bed –</line>
      <line>Go, shed one tear upon my heather-bloom,</line>
      <line>And it shall comfort me within the tomb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I am a shadow now, alas! alas!</line>
      <line>Upon the skirts of human-nature dwelling</line>
      <line>Alone. I chant alone the holy mass,</line>
      <line>While little sounds of life are round me knelling,</line>
      <line>And glossy bees at noon do fieldward pass,</line>
      <line>And many a chapel-bell the hour is telling,</line>
      <line>Paining me through! Those sounds grow strange to me,</line>
      <line>And thou art distant in humanity.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I know what was, I feel full well what is –</line>
      <line>And I should rage, if spirits could go mad!</line>
      <line> Though I forget the taste of earthly bliss,</line>
      <line>That paleness warms my grave, as though I had</line>
      <line>A seraph chosen from the bright abyss</line>
      <line>To be my spouse. Thy paleness makes me glad;</line>
      <line>Thy beauty grows upon me, and I feel</line>
      <line>A greater love through all my essence steal.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The spirit mourned ‘Adieu’, dissolved, and left</line>
      <line>The atom-darkness in a slow turmoil –</line>
      <line>As when, of healthful midnight-sleep bereft,</line>
      <line>Thinking on ruggéd hours and fruitless toil,</line>
      <line> We put our eyes into a pillowy cleft,</line>
      <line>And see the spangly gloom froth up and boil!</line>
      <line>It made sad Isabella’s eyelids ache,</line>
      <line>And in the dawn she started up awake –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Ha! ha!’ said she, ‘I knew not this hard life,</line>
      <line>I thought the worst was simple misery;</line>
      <line>I thought some fate with pleasure or with strife</line>
      <line>Portioned us – happy days, or else to die.</line>
      <line>But there is crime: a brother’s bloody knife!</line>
      <line>Sweet spirit, thou hast schooled my infancy:</line>
      <line> I’ll visit thee for this, and kiss thine eyes,</line>
      <line>And greet thee morn and even in the skies.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When the full morning came, she had devised</line>
      <line>How she might secret to the forest hie;</line>
      <line>How she might find the clay, so dearly prized,</line>
      <line>And sing to it one latest lullaby;</line>
      <line>How her short absence might be unsurmised,</line>
      <line>While she the inmost of the dream would try.</line>
      <line>Resolved, she took with her an agéd nurse,</line>
      <line>And went into that dismal forest-hearse.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> See, as they creep along the river-side,</line>
      <line>How she doth whisper to that agéd dame,</line>
      <line>And, after looking round the champaign wide,</line>
      <line>Shows her a knife. ‘What feverous hectic flame</line>
      <line>Burns in thee, child? What good can thee betide,</line>
      <line>That thou shouldst smile again?’ The evening came,</line>
      <line>And they had found Lorenzo’s earthy bed:</line>
      <line>The flint was there, the berries at his head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who hath not loitered in a green churchyard,</line>
      <line>And let his spirit, like a demon-mole,</line>
      <line> Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,</line>
      <line>To see skull, coffined bones, and funeral-stole;</line>
      <line>Pitying each form that hungry Death hath marred,</line>
      <line>And filling it once more with human soul?</line>
      <line>Ah, this is holiday to what was felt</line>
      <line>When Isabella by Lorenzo knelt!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She gazed into the fresh-thrown mould, as though</line>
      <line>One glance did fully all its secrets tell.</line>
      <line>Clearly she saw, as other eyes would know</line>
      <line>Pale limbs at bottom of a crystal well.</line>
      <line> Upon the murderous spot she seemed to grow,</line>
      <line>Like to a native lily of the dell –</line>
      <line>Then with her knife, all sudden, she began</line>
      <line>To dig more fervently than misers can.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Soon she turned up a soiléd glove, whereon</line>
      <line>Her silk had played in purple fantasies –</line>
      <line>She kissed it with a lip more chill than stone,</line>
      <line>And put it in her bosom, where it dries</line>
      <line>And freezes utterly unto the bone</line>
      <line>Those dainties made to still an infant’s cries!</line>
      <line> Then ’gan she work again – nor stayed her care,</line>
      <line>But to throw back at times her veiling hair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That old nurse stood beside her wondering,</line>
      <line>Until her heart felt pity to the core</line>
      <line>At sight of such a dismal labouring,</line>
      <line>And so she kneeléd, with her locks all hoar,</line>
      <line>And put her lean hands to the horrid thing.</line>
      <line>Three hours they laboured at this travail sore;</line>
      <line>At last they felt the kernel of the grave,</line>
      <line>And Isabella did not stamp and rave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Ah, wherefore all this wormy circumstance?</line>
      <line>Why linger at the yawning tomb so long?</line>
      <line>Oh for the gentleness of old romance,</line>
      <line>The simple plaining of a minstrel’s song!</line>
      <line>Fair reader, at the old tale take a glance,</line>
      <line>For here, in truth, it doth not well belong</line>
      <line>To speak – oh turn thee to the very tale,</line>
      <line>And taste the music of that vision pale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With duller steel than the Perséan sword</line>
      <line>They cut away no formless monster’s head,</line>
      <line> But one whose gentleness did well accord</line>
      <line>With death, as life. The ancient harps have said</line>
      <line>Love never dies, but lives, immortal Lord.</line>
      <line>If Love impersonate was ever dead,</line>
      <line>Pale Isabella kissed it, and low moaned.</line>
      <line>’Twas Love, cold – dead indeed – but not dethroned.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In anxious secrecy they took it home,</line>
      <line>And then the prize was all for Isabel!</line>
      <line>She calmed its wild hair with a golden comb,</line>
      <line>And all around each eye’s sepulchral cell</line>
      <line>Pointed each fringéd lash. The smearéd loam</line>
      <line>With tears as chilly as a dripping well</line>
      <line>She drenched away – and still she combed, and kept</line>
      <line>Sighing all day – and still she kissed, and wept.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then in a silken scarf – sweet with the dews</line>
      <line>Of precious flowers plucked in Araby,</line>
      <line>And divine liquids come with odorous ooze</line>
      <line>Through the cold serpent-pipe refreshfully –</line>
      <line>She wrapped it up, and for its tomb did choose</line>
      <line>A garden-pot, wherein she laid it by</line>
      <line> And covered it with mould, and o’er it set</line>
      <line>Sweet basil, which her tears kept ever wet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And she forgot the stars, the moon, and sun,</line>
      <line>And she forgot the blue above the trees,</line>
      <line>And she forgot the dells where waters run,</line>
      <line>And she forgot the chilly autumn breeze –</line>
      <line>She had no knowledge when the day was done,</line>
      <line>And the new morn she saw not, but in peace</line>
      <line>Hung over her sweet basil evermore,</line>
      <line>And moistened it with tears unto the core.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And so she ever fed it with thin tears,</line>
      <line>Whence thick, and green, and beautiful it grew,</line>
      <line>So that it smelt more balmy than its peers</line>
      <line>Of basil-tufts in Florence; for it drew</line>
      <line>Nurture besides, and life, from human fears –</line>
      <line>From the fast-mouldering head there shut from view –</line>
      <line>So that the jewel, safely casketed,</line>
      <line>Came forth, and in perfuméd leafits spread.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Melancholy, linger here awhile!</line>
      <line>Oh Music, Music, breathe despondingly!</line>
      <line> Oh Echo, Echo, from some sombre isle</line>
      <line>Unknown, Lethean, sigh to us, oh sigh!</line>
      <line>Spirits in grief, lift up your heads, and smile –</line>
      <line>Lift up your heads, sweet spirits, heavily,</line>
      <line>And make a pale light in your cypress-glooms,</line>
      <line>Tinting with silver wan your marble tombs.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Moan hither, all ye syllables of woe,</line>
      <line>From the deep throat of sad Melpomene!</line>
      <line>Through bronzéd lyre in tragic order go,</line>
      <line>And touch the strings into a mystery!</line>
      <line> Sound mournfully upon the winds and low,</line>
      <line>For simple Isabel is soon to be</line>
      <line>Among the dead. She withers, like a palm</line>
      <line>Cut by an Indian for its juicy balm.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh leave the palm to wither by itself,</line>
      <line>Let not quick winter chill its dying hour!</line>
      <line>It may not be – those Baälites of pelf,</line>
      <line>Her brethren, noted the continual shower</line>
      <line>From her dead eyes; and many a curious elf,</line>
      <line>Among her kindred, wondered that such dower</line>
      <line> Of youth and beauty should be thrown aside</line>
      <line>By one marked out to be a noble’s bride.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, furthermore, her brethren wondered much</line>
      <line>Why she sat drooping by the basil green,</line>
      <line>And why it flourished, as by magic touch –</line>
      <line>Greatly they wondered what the thing might mean.</line>
      <line>They could not surely give belief that such</line>
      <line>A very nothing would have power to wean</line>
      <line>Her from her own fair youth and pleasures gay –</line>
      <line>And even remembrance of her love’s delay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Therefore they watched a time when they might sift</line>
      <line>This hidden whim – and long they watched in vain,</line>
      <line>For seldom did she go to chapel-shrift,</line>
      <line>And seldom felt she any hunger-pain;</line>
      <line>And when she left, she hurried back, as swift</line>
      <line>As bird on wing to breast its eggs again,</line>
      <line>And, patient as a hen-bird, sat her there</line>
      <line>Beside her basil, weeping through her hair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet they contrived to steal the basil-pot,</line>
      <line>And to examine it in secret place.</line>
      <line> The thing was vile with green and livid spot,</line>
      <line>And yet they knew it was Lorenzo’s face –</line>
      <line>The guerdon of their murder they had got,</line>
      <line>And so left Florence in a moment’s space,</line>
      <line>Never to turn again. Away they went,</line>
      <line>With blood upon their heads, to banishment!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Melancholy, turn thine eyes away!</line>
      <line>Oh Music, Music, breathe despondingly!</line>
      <line>Oh Echo, Echo, on some other day,</line>
      <line>From isles Lethean, sigh to us, oh sigh!</line>
      <line> Spirits of grief, sing not your ‘Well-a-way!’</line>
      <line>For Isabel, sweet Isabel, will die –</line>
      <line>Will die a death too lone and incomplete,</line>
      <line>Now they have ta’en away her basil sweet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Piteous, she looked on dead and senseless things,</line>
      <line>Asking for her lost basil amorously;</line>
      <line>And with melodious chuckle in the strings</line>
      <line>Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry</line>
      <line>After the pilgrim in his wanderings</line>
      <line>To ask him where her basil was, and why</line>
      <line> ’Twas hid from her. ‘For cruel ’tis’, said she,</line>
      <line>‘To steal my basil-pot away from me!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And so she pined, and so she died forlorn,</line>
      <line>Imploring for her basil to the last.</line>
      <line>No heart was there in Florence but did mourn</line>
      <line>In pity of her love, so overcast;</line>
      <line>And a sad ditty, of this story born,</line>
      <line>From mouth to mouth through all the country passed.</line>
      <line>Still is the burden sung: ‘Oh cruelty,</line>
      <line>To steal my basil-pot away from me!’</line>

    <title>The Shipwreck (from Don Juan II)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>At half-past eight o’clock, booms, hencoops, spars,</line>
      <line>And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose</line>
      <line>That still could keep afloat the struggling tars –</line>
      <line>For yet they strove, although of no great use:</line>
      <line>There was no light in heaven but a few stars,</line>
      <line>The boats put off o’ercrowded with their crews;</line>
      <line>She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,</line>
      <line>And, going down head foremost – sunk, in short.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell,</line>
      <line>Then shrieked the timid, and stood still the brave;</line>
      <line>Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,</line>
      <line>As eager to anticipate their grave;</line>
      <line>And the sea yawned around her like a hell,</line>
      <line>And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,</line>
      <line> Like one who grapples with his enemy,</line>
      <line>And strives to strangle him before he die…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Juan got into the long-boat, and there</line>
      <line>Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place.</line>
      <line>It seemed as if they had exchanged their care,</line>
      <line>For Juan wore the magisterial face</line>
      <line> Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo’s pair</line>
      <line>Of eyes were crying for their owner’s case:</line>
      <line>Battista, though (a name called shortly ‘Tita’)</line>
      <line>Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,</line>
      <line>But the same cause, conducive to his loss,</line>
      <line>Left him so drunk, he jumped into the wave</line>
      <line>As o’er the cutter’s edge he tried to cross,</line>
      <line>And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;</line>
      <line>They could not rescue him although so close,</line>
      <line> Because the sea ran higher every minute,</line>
      <line>And for the boat – the crew kept crowding in it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A small old spaniel, which had been Don Jóse’s</line>
      <line>(His father’s), whom he loved, as ye may think,</line>
      <line>For on such things the memory reposes</line>
      <line>With tenderness, stood howling on the brink,</line>
      <line>Knowing – dogs have such intellectual noses! –</line>
      <line>No doubt, the vessel was about to sink,</line>
      <line>And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepped</line>
      <line>Off, threw him in, then after him he leapt…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis said that persons living on annuities</line>
      <line>Are longer-lived than others – God knows why,</line>
      <line> Unless to plague the grantors – yet so true it is</line>
      <line>That some, I really think, do never die!</line>
      <line>Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,</line>
      <line>And that’s their mode of furnishing supply:</line>
      <line>In my young days they lent me cash that way,</line>
      <line>Which I found very troublesome to pay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis thus with people in an open boat,</line>
      <line>They live upon the love of life, and bear</line>
      <line>More than can be believed, or even thought,</line>
      <line>And stand like rocks the tempest’s wear and tear;</line>
      <line> And hardship still has been the sailor’s lot,</line>
      <line>Since Noah’s ark went cruising here and there –</line>
      <line>She had a curious crew as well as cargo,</line>
      <line>Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But man is a carnivorous production</line>
      <line>And must have meals, at least one meal a day;</line>
      <line>He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,</line>
      <line>But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey –</line>
      <line>Although his anatomical construction</line>
      <line>Bears vegetables in a grumbling way,</line>
      <line> Your labouring-people think beyond all question,</line>
      <line>Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus it was with this our hapless crew,</line>
      <line>For on the third day there came on a calm,</line>
      <line>And though at first their strength it might renew</line>
      <line>(And lying on their weariness like balm,</line>
      <line>Lulled them like turtles sleeping on the blue</line>
      <line>Of ocean), when they woke they felt a qualm</line>
      <line>And fell all ravenously on their provision,</line>
      <line>Instead of hoarding it with due precision.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The consequence was easily foreseen –</line>
      <line>They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,</line>
      <line>In spite of all remonstrances, and then</line>
      <line>On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?</line>
      <line>They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!</line>
      <line>And carry them to shore – these hopes were fine,</line>
      <line>But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,</line>
      <line>It would have been more wise to save their victual!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,</line>
      <line>And Ocean slumbered like an unweaned child:</line>
      <line> The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there –</line>
      <line>The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild –</line>
      <line>With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)</line>
      <line>What could they do? And hunger’s rage grew wild!</line>
      <line>So Juan’s spaniel, spite of his entreating,</line>
      <line>Was killed, and portioned out for present eating.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,</line>
      <line>And Juan, who had still refused, because</line>
      <line>The creature was his father’s dog that died,</line>
      <line>Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,</line>
      <line> With some remorse received (though first denied)</line>
      <line>As a great favour one of the forepaws,</line>
      <line>Which he divided with Pedrillo, who</line>
      <line>Devoured it, longing for the other too.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The seventh day, and no wind – the burning sun</line>
      <line>Blistered and scorched, and, stagnant on the sea,</line>
      <line>They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,</line>
      <line>Save in the breeze that came not! Savagely</line>
      <line>They glared upon each other – all was done,</line>
      <line>Water, and wine, and food – and you might see</line>
      <line> The longings of the cannibal arise</line>
      <line>(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length one whispered his companion, who</line>
      <line>Whispered another, and thus it went round,</line>
      <line>And then into a hoarser murmur grew</line>
      <line>(An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound),</line>
      <line>And when his comrade’s thought each sufferer knew,</line>
      <line>’Twas but his own, suppressed till now, he found –</line>
      <line>And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,</line>
      <line>And who should die to be his fellow’s food.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But ere they came to this, they that day shared</line>
      <line>Some leathern caps, and what remained of shoes;</line>
      <line>And then they looked around them, and despaired,</line>
      <line>And none to be the sacrifice would choose:</line>
      <line>At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,</line>
      <line>But of materials that much shock the Muse –</line>
      <line>Having no paper, for the want of better,</line>
      <line>They took by force from Juan, Julia’s letter.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The lots were made, and marked, and mixed, and handed,</line>
      <line>In silent horror, and their distribution</line>
      <line> Lulled even the savage hunger which demanded,</line>
      <line>Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution.</line>
      <line>None in particular had sought or planned it,</line>
      <line>’Twas Nature gnawed them to this resolution,</line>
      <line>By which none were permitted to be neuter –</line>
      <line>And the lot fell on Juan’s luckless tutor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He but requested to be bled to death:</line>
      <line>The surgeon had his instruments, and bled</line>
      <line>Pedrillo, and so gently ebbed his breath</line>
      <line>You hardly could perceive when he was dead.</line>
      <line>He died as born, a Catholic in faith,</line>
      <line>Like most in the belief in which they’re bred,</line>
      <line>And first a little crucifix he kissed,</line>
      <line>And then held out his jugular and wrist.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The surgeon, as there was no other fee,</line>
      <line>Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;</line>
      <line>But being thirstiest at the moment, he</line>
      <line>Preferred a draught from the fast-flowing veins.</line>
      <line>Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,</line>
      <line>And such things as the entrails and the brains</line>
      <line> Regaled two sharks, who followed o’er the billow –</line>
      <line>The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sailors ate him, all save three or four</line>
      <line>Who were not quite so fond of animal food;</line>
      <line>To these was added Juan who, before,</line>
      <line>Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could</line>
      <line>Feel now his appetite increased much more –</line>
      <line>’Twas not to be expected that he should,</line>
      <line>Even in extremity of their disaster,</line>
      <line>Dine with them on his pastor and his master.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ’Twas better that he did not; for, in fact,</line>
      <line>The consequence was awful in the extreme:</line>
      <line>For they, who were most ravenous in the act,</line>
      <line>Went raging mad. Lord! how they did blaspheme,</line>
      <line>And foam and roll, with strange convulsions racked,</line>
      <line>Drinking salt-water like a mountain-stream,</line>
      <line>Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,</line>
      <line>And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Their numbers were much thinned by this infliction,</line>
      <line>And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;</line>
      <line> And some of them had lost their recollection,</line>
      <line>Happier than they who still perceived their woes;</line>
      <line>But others pondered on a new dissection,</line>
      <line>As if not warned sufficiently by those</line>
      <line>Who had already perished, suffering madly,</line>
      <line>For having used their appetites so sadly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And next they thought upon the master’s mate,</line>
      <line>As fattest; but he saved himself, because,</line>
      <line>Besides being much averse from such a fate,</line>
      <line>There were some other reasons: the first was,</line>
      <line> He had been rather indisposed of late –</line>
      <line>And that which chiefly proved his saving clause,</line>
      <line>Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,</line>
      <line>By general subscription of the ladies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Of poor Pedrillo something still remained,</line>
      <line>But was used sparingly – some were afraid,</line>
      <line>And others still their appetites constrained,</line>
      <line>Or but at times a little supper made –</line>
      <line>All except Juan, who throughout abstained,</line>
      <line>Chewing a piece of bamboo, and some lead</line>
      <line> At length they caught two boobies, and a noddy,</line>
      <line>And then they left off eating the dead body.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if Pedrillo’s fate should shocking be,</line>
      <line>Remember Ugolino condescends</line>
      <line>To eat the head of his arch-enemy</line>
      <line>The moment after he politely ends</line>
      <line>His tale; if foes be food in Hell, at sea</line>
      <line>’Tis surely fair to dine upon our friends,</line>
      <line>When shipwreck’s short allowance grows too scanty,</line>
      <line>Without being much more horrible than Dante.</line>

    <title>The Dream of Eugene Aram</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas in the prime of summer-time,</line>
      <line>An evening calm and cool,</line>
      <line>And four-and-twenty happy boys</line>
      <line>Came bounding out of school:</line>
      <line> There were some that ran, and some that leapt</line>
      <line>Like troutlets in a pool.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away they sped with gamesome minds,</line>
      <line>And souls untouched by sin –</line>
      <line>To a level mead they came, and there</line>
      <line>They drove the wickets in;</line>
      <line>Pleasantly shone the setting sun</line>
      <line>Over the town of Lynn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Like sportive deer they coursed about,</line>
      <line>And shouted as they ran –</line>
      <line> Turning to mirth all things of earth,</line>
      <line>As only boyhood can;</line>
      <line>But the Usher sat remote from all,</line>
      <line>A melancholy man.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His hat was off, his vest apart,</line>
      <line>To catch Heaven’s blesséd breeze,</line>
      <line>For a burning thought was in his brow,</line>
      <line>And his bosom ill at ease –</line>
      <line>So he leaned his head on his hands, and read</line>
      <line>The book between his knees.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Leaf after leaf he turned it o’er,</line>
      <line>Nor ever glanced aside;</line>
      <line>For the peace of his soul he read that book</line>
      <line>In the golden eventide –</line>
      <line>Much study had made him very lean,</line>
      <line>And pale, and leaden-eyed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At last he shut the ponderous tome –</line>
      <line>With a fast and fervent grasp</line>
      <line>He strained the dusky covers close,</line>
      <line>And fixed the brazen hasp:</line>
      <line> ‘Oh God, could I so close my mind,</line>
      <line>And clasp it with a clasp!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then leaping on his feet upright,</line>
      <line>Some moody turns he took –</line>
      <line>Now up the mead, then down the mead,</line>
      <line>And past a shady nook –</line>
      <line>And lo, he saw a little boy</line>
      <line>That pored upon a book.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘My gentle lad, what is’t you read –</line>
      <line>Romance or fairy-fable?</line>
      <line> Or is it some historic page</line>
      <line>Of kings and crowns unstable?’</line>
      <line>The young boy gave an upward glance:</line>
      <line>‘It is The Death of Abel.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Usher took six hasty strides,</line>
      <line>As smit with sudden pain –</line>
      <line>Six hasty strides beyond the place,</line>
      <line>Then slowly back again –</line>
      <line>And down he sat beside the lad,</line>
      <line>And talked with him of Cain,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And (long since then) of bloody men</line>
      <line>Whose deeds tradition saves:</line>
      <line>Of lonely folk cut off unseen,</line>
      <line>And hid in sudden graves;</line>
      <line>Of horrid stabs, in groves forlorn,</line>
      <line>And murders done in caves;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And how the sprites of injured men</line>
      <line>Shriek upward from the sod,</line>
      <line>Aye, how the ghostly hand will point</line>
      <line>To show the burial-clod,</line>
      <line> And unknown facts of guilty acts</line>
      <line>Are seen in dreams from God!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He told how murderers walk the earth</line>
      <line>Beneath the curse of Cain,</line>
      <line>With crimson clouds before their eyes,</line>
      <line>And flames about their brain –</line>
      <line>For blood has left upon their souls</line>
      <line>Its everlasting stain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And well’ quoth he, ‘I know, for truth,</line>
      <line>Their pangs must be extreme –</line>
      <line> Woe, woe, unutterable woe –</line>
      <line>Who spill life’s sacred stream!</line>
      <line>For why? Methought, last night, I wrought</line>
      <line>A murder in a dream:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One that had never done me wrong</line>
      <line>(A feeble man, and old),</line>
      <line>I led him to a lonely field –</line>
      <line>The moon shone clear and cold –</line>
      <line>Now here, said I, this man shall die,</line>
      <line>And I will have his gold!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Two sudden blows with a ragged stick,</line>
      <line>And one with a heavy stone,</line>
      <line>One hurried gash with a hasty knife –</line>
      <line>And then the deed was done!</line>
      <line>There was nothing lying at my foot</line>
      <line>But lifeless flesh and bone –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nothing but lifeless flesh and bone,</line>
      <line>That could not do me ill,</line>
      <line>And yet I feared him all the more</line>
      <line>For lying there so still:</line>
      <line> There was a manhood in his look</line>
      <line>That murder could not kill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And lo, the universal air</line>
      <line>Seemed lit with ghastly flame –</line>
      <line>Ten thousand, thousand dreadful eyes</line>
      <line>Were looking down in blame:</line>
      <line>I took the dead man by his hand,</line>
      <line>And called upon his name!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh God, it made me quake to see</line>
      <line>Such sense within the slain;</line>
      <line>But when I touched the lifeless clay</line>
      <line>The blood gushed out amain –</line>
      <line>For every clot, a burning spot</line>
      <line>Was scorching in my brain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My head was like an ardent coal,</line>
      <line>My heart as solid ice;</line>
      <line>My wretched, wretched soul, I knew,</line>
      <line>Was at the Devil’s price!</line>
      <line>A dozen times I groaned – the Dead</line>
      <line>Had never groaned but twice.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And now, from forth the frowning sky,</line>
      <line>From the Heaven’s topmost height,</line>
      <line>I heard a voice – the awful voice</line>
      <line>Of the blood-avenging sprite:</line>
      <line>“Thou guilty man, take up thy dead</line>
      <line>And hide it from my sight!”</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I took the dreary body up,</line>
      <line>And cast it in a stream,</line>
      <line>A sluggish water, black as ink,</line>
      <line>Its depth was so extreme –</line>
      <line> My dearest boy, remember this</line>
      <line>Is nothing but a dream!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Down went the corse with hollow plunge</line>
      <line>And vanished in the pool;</line>
      <line>Anon I cleansed my bloody hands,</line>
      <line>And washed my forehead cool –</line>
      <line>And sat among the urchins young</line>
      <line>That evening in the School!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Heaven, to think of their white souls,</line>
      <line>And mine so black and grim!</line>
      <line> I could not share in childish prayer,</line>
      <line>Nor join in evening hymn –</line>
      <line>Like a devil of the pit I seemed,</line>
      <line>Mid holy cherubim!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And peace went with them, one and all,</line>
      <line>And each calm pillow spread,</line>
      <line>But Guilt was my grim chamberlain</line>
      <line>That lighted me to bed,</line>
      <line>And drew my midnight-curtains round</line>
      <line>With fingers bloody red!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> All night I lay in agony,</line>
      <line>In anguish dark and deep;</line>
      <line>My fevered eyes I dared not close,</line>
      <line>But stared aghast at Sleep –</line>
      <line>For Sin had rendered unto her</line>
      <line>The keys of Hell to keep!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All night I lay in agony,</line>
      <line>From weary chime to chime,</line>
      <line>With one besetting horrid hint</line>
      <line>That racked me all the time –</line>
      <line> A mighty yearning, like the first</line>
      <line>Fierce impulse unto crime!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One stern tyrannic thought, that made</line>
      <line>All other thoughts its slave –</line>
      <line>Stronger and stronger every pulse</line>
      <line>Did that temptation crave,</line>
      <line>Still urging me to go and see</line>
      <line>The dead man in his grave!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Heavily I rose up, as soon</line>
      <line>As light was in the sky,</line>
      <line> And sought the black accursed pool</line>
      <line>With a wild misgiving eye –</line>
      <line>And saw the Dead in the river bed,</line>
      <line>For the faithless stream was dry!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Merrily rose the lark, and shook</line>
      <line>The dewdrop from its wing –</line>
      <line>But I never marked its morning-flight,</line>
      <line>I never heard it sing,</line>
      <line>For I was stooping once again</line>
      <line>Under the horrid thing!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> With breathless speed, like a soul in chase,</line>
      <line>I took him up and ran –</line>
      <line>There was no time to dig a grave</line>
      <line>Before the day began:</line>
      <line>In a lonesome wood, with heaps of leaves,</line>
      <line>I hid the murdered man.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And all that day I read in school,</line>
      <line>But my thought was other-where –</line>
      <line>As soon as the midday task was done,</line>
      <line>In secret I was there:</line>
      <line> And a mighty wind had swept the leaves,</line>
      <line>And still the corse was bare!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then down I cast me on my face,</line>
      <line>And first began to weep,</line>
      <line>For I knew my secret then was one</line>
      <line>The earth refused to keep –</line>
      <line>Or land or sea, though he should be</line>
      <line>Ten thousand fathoms deep!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So wills the fierce avenging sprite,</line>
      <line>Till blood for blood atones!</line>
      <line> Aye, though he’s buried in a cave,</line>
      <line>And trodden down with stones,</line>
      <line>And years have rotted off his flesh –</line>
      <line>The world shall see his bones!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh God, that horrid, horrid dream</line>
      <line>Besets me, now awake:</line>
      <line>Again, again, with dizzy brain,</line>
      <line>The human life I take –</line>
      <line>And my red right hand grows raging hot</line>
      <line>Like Cranmer’s at the stake.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And still no peace for the restless clay</line>
      <line>Will wave or mound allow;</line>
      <line>The horrid thing pursues my soul –</line>
      <line>It stands before me now!’</line>
      <line>The fearful boy looked up and saw</line>
      <line>Huge drops upon his brow.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That very night, while gentle sleep</line>
      <line>The urchin’s eyelids kissed,</line>
      <line>Two stern-faced men set out from Lynn</line>
      <line>Through the cold and heavy mist;</line>
      <line> And Eugene Aram walked between,</line>
      <line>With gyves upon his wrist.</line>

    <title>Indian Woman’s Death Song</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Down a broad river of the western wilds,</line>
      <line>Piercing thick forest-glooms, a light canoe</line>
      <line>Swept with the current. Fearful was the speed</line>
      <line>Of the frail bark, as by a tempest’s wing</line>
      <line> Borne leaf-like on to where the mist of spray</line>
      <line>Rose with the cataract’s thunder. Yet within,</line>
      <line>Proudly, and dauntlessly, and all alone,</line>
      <line>Save that a babe lay sleeping at her breast,</line>
      <line>A woman stood. Upon her Indian brow</line>
      <line>Sat a strange gladness, and her dark hair waved</line>
      <line>As if triumphantly! She pressed her child</line>
      <line>In its bright slumber to her beating heart,</line>
      <line>And lifted her sweet voice, that rose awhile</line>
      <line>Above the sound of waters, high and clear,</line>
      <line> Wafting a wild proud strain – a song of death:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Roll swiftly to the spirit’s land, thou mighty stream and free!</line>
      <line>Father of ancient waters, roll – and bear our lives with thee!</line>
      <line>The weary bird that storms have tossed would seek the sunshine’s calm,</line>
      <line>And the deer that hath the arrow’s hurt flies to the woods of balm.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Roll on! My warrior’s eye hath looked upon another’s face,</line>
      <line>And mine hath faded from his soul, as fades a moonbeam’s trace:</line>
      <line>My shadow comes not o’er his path, my whisper to his dream,</line>
      <line>He flings away the broken reed – roll swifter yet, thou stream!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The voice that spoke of other days is hushed within his breast,</line>
      <line> But mine its lonely music haunts, and will not let me rest:</line>
      <line>It sings a low and mournful song of gladness that is gone,</line>
      <line>I cannot live without that light – father of waves, roll on!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Will he not miss the bounding step that met him from the chase,</line>
      <line>The heart of love that made his home an ever-sunny place,</line>
      <line>The hand that spread the hunter’s board, and decked his couch of yore?</line>
      <line>He will not! Roll, dark foaming stream, on to the better shore!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some blesséd fount amidst the woods of that bright land must flow,</line>
      <line>Whose waters from my soul may lave the memory of this woe;</line>
      <line>Some gentle wind must whisper there, whose breath may waft away</line>
      <line> The burden of the heavy night, the sadness of the day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thou, my babe! though born like me for woman’s weary lot,</line>
      <line>Smile! To that wasting of the heart, my own! I leave thee not –</line>
      <line>Too bright a thing art thou to pine in aching love away –</line>
      <line>Thy mother bears thee far, young fawn! from sorrow and decay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She bears thee to the glorious bowers where none are heard to weep,</line>
      <line>And where the unkind one hath no power again to trouble sleep,</line>
      <line>And where the soul shall find its youth, as wakening from a dream –</line>
      <line>One moment, and that realm is ours! On, on, dark rolling stream!’</line>

      <line>She sat alone beside her hearth –</line>
      <line>For many nights alone –</line>
      <line>She slept not on the pleasant couch</line>
      <line>Where fragrant herbs were strown.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> At first she bound her raven hair</line>
      <line>With feather and with shell –</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>They saw her wandering mid the woods,</line>
      <line>Lone, with the cheerless dawn,</line>

    </stanza>

      <line>Her heart was in her large sad eyes,</line>

      <line>The red leaf far more heavily</line>

      <line>A stranger to her forest home,</line>

      <line> Alas for love that sits at home,</line>
      <line>Forsaken, and yet fond –</line>
      <line>The grief that sits beside the hearth,</line>
      <line>Life has no grief beyond!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He left her, but she followed him –</line>
      <line>She thought he could not bear,</line>
      <line>When she had left her home for him,</line>
      <line>To look on her despair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Adown the strange and mighty stream</line>
      <line>She took her lonely way:</line>
      <line> The stars at night her pilots were,</line>
      <line>As was the sun by day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet mournfully – how mournfully –</line>
      <line>The Indian looked behind</line>
      <line>When the last sound of voice or step</line>
      <line>Died on the midnight wind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet still adown the gloomy stream</line>
      <line>She plied her weary oar –</line>
      <line>Her husband, he had left their home,</line>
      <line>And it was home no more.</line>

      <line> She found him – but she found in vain –</line>

      <line>He said her brow was all too dark</line>
      <line>For her to be his bride.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She grasped his hands – her own were cold –</line>
      <line>And silent turned away,</line>
      <line>As she had not a tear to shed</line>
      <line>And not a word to say.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And pale as death she reached her boat,</line>
      <line>And guided it along;</line>
      <line> With broken voice she strove to raise</line>
      <line>A melancholy song.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>None watched the lonely Indian girl –</line>
      <line>She passed unmarked of all –</line>
      <line>Until they saw her slight canoe</line>
      <line>OApproach the mighty Fall!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upright within that slender boat</line>
      <line>They saw the pale girl stand,</line>
      <line>Her dark hair streaming far behind,</line>
      <line>Upraised her desperate hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The air is filled with shriek and shout:</line>
      <line>They call, but call in vain!</line>
      <line>The boat amid the waters dashed –</line>
      <line>’Twas never seen again.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, hear a pensive captive’s prayer,</line>
      <line>For liberty that sighs,</line>
      <line>And never let thine heart be shut</line>
      <line>Against the prisoner’s cries!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> For here forlorn and sad I sit,</line>
      <line>Within the wiry grate,</line>

      <line>A free-born mouse detain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, do not stain with guiltless blood</line>
      <line>Thy hospitable hearth,</line>
      <line> Nor triumph that thy wiles betrayed</line>
      <line>A prize so little worth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The scattered gleanings of a feast</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The cheerful light, the vital air,</line>

      <line>Let Nature’s commoners enjoy</line>
      <line>The common gifts of Heaven.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The well-taught philosophic mind</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If mind, as ancient sages taught,</line>

    <title>from A Summer’s Evening’s Meditation</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis now the hour</line>
      <line>When Contemplation from her sunless haunts</line>
      <line>(The cool damp grotto or the lonely depth</line>
      <line>Of unpierced woods), where, wrapped in solid shade,</line>
      <line>She mused away the gaudy hours of noon</line>
      <line>And fed on thoughts unripened by the sun,</line>
      <line>Moves forward, and with radiant finger points</line>
      <line>To yon blue concave swelled by breath divine,</line>
      <line> Where, one by one, the living eyes of Heaven</line>
      <line>Awake, quick-kindling o’er the face of ether</line>
      <line>One boundless blaze – ten thousand trembling fires</line>
      <line>And dancing lustres – where the unsteady eye,</line>
      <line>Restless and dazzled, wanders unconfined</line>
      <line>O’er all this field of glories! Spacious field,</line>
      <line>And worthy of the Master – he whose hand</line>
      <line>With hieroglyphics older than the Nile</line>
      <line>Inscribed the mystic tablet hung on high</line>
      <line>To public gaze, and said, ‘Adore, oh man,</line>
      <line>The finger of thy God!’</line>
      <line> From what pure wells</line>
      <line>Of milky light, what soft o’erflowing urn,</line>
      <line>Are all these lamps so filled – these friendly lamps</line>
      <line>For ever streaming o’er the azure deep</line>
      <line>To point our path and light us to our home?</line>
      <line>How soft they slide along their lucid spheres,</line>
      <line>And, silent as the foot of time, fulfil</line>
      <line>Their destined courses! Nature’s self is hushed</line>
      <line>And, but a scattered leaf which rustles through</line>
      <line>The thick-wove foliage, not a sound is heard</line>
      <line> To break the midnight air – though the raised ear,</line>
      <line>Intensely listening, drinks in every breath.</line>
      <line>How deep the silence, yet how loud the praise!</line>
      <line>But are they silent all? Or is there not</line>
      <line>A tongue in every star that talks with man</line>
      <line>And woos him to be wise – nor woos in vain?</line>
      <line>This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,</line>
      <line>And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.</line>
      <line>At this still hour the self-collected soul</line>
      <line>Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there</line>
      <line> Of high descent, and more than mortal rank:</line>
      <line>An embryo God, a spark of fire divine</line>
      <line>Which must burn on for ages, when the sun</line>
      <line>(Fair transitory creature of a day)</line>
      <line>Has closed his golden eye and, wrapped in shades,</line>
      <line>Forgets his wonted journey through the east.</line>
      <line>Ye citadels of light and seats of gods –</line>
      <line>Perhaps my future home! – from whence the soul,</line>
      <line>Revolving periods past, may oft look back</line>
      <line>With recollected tenderness on all</line>
      <line> The various busy scenes she left below</line>
      <line>(Its deep-laid projects and its strange events),</line>
      <line>As on some fond and doting tale that soothed</line>
      <line>Her infant hours. Oh be it lawful now</line>
      <line>To tread the hallowed circle of your courts,</line>
      <line>And with mute wonder and delighted awe</line>
      <line>Approach your burning confines!</line>
      <line>Seized in thought,</line>
      <line>On fancy’s wild and roving wing I sail,</line>
      <line>From the green borders of the peopled earth</line>
      <line>And the pale moon, her duteous fair attendant;</line>
      <line> From solitary Mars; from the vast orb</line>
      <line>Of Jupiter, whose huge gigantic bulk</line>
      <line>Dances in ether like the lightest leaf –</line>
      <line>To the dim verge, the suburbs of the system,</line>
      <line>Where cheerless Saturn midst her watery moons,</line>
      <line>Girt with a lucid zone, majestic sits</line>
      <line>In gloomy grandeur, like an exiled queen</line>
      <line>Amongst her weeping handmaids.</line>
      <line>Fearless thence</line>
      <line>I launch into the trackless deeps of space</line>
      <line>Where, burning round, ten thousand suns appear</line>
      <line> Of elder beam, which ask no leave to shine</line>
      <line>Of our terrestrial star, nor borrow light</line>
      <line>From the proud regent of our scanty day –</line>
      <line>Sons of the morning, first-born of Creation,</line>
      <line>And only less than Him who marks their track</line>
      <line>And guides their fiery wheels. Here must I stop,</line>
      <line>Or is there aught beyond? What hand unseen</line>
      <line>Impels me onward through the glowing orbs</line>
      <line>Of habitable Nature far remote,</line>
      <line>To the dread confines of eternal night,</line>
      <line> To solitudes of vast unpeopled space,</line>
      <line>The deserts of Creation, wide and wild,</line>
      <line>Where embryo systems and unkindled suns</line>
      <line>Sleep in the womb of chaos?</line>

    <title>The Winter Evening (Task IV)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze</line>
      <line>With lights, by clear reflection multiplied</line>
      <line>From many a mirror – in which he of Gath,</line>
      <line>Goliath, might have seen his giant bulk</line>
      <line>Whole, without stooping, towering crest and all –</line>
      <line>My pleasures, too, begin. But me perhaps,</line>
      <line>The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile</line>
      <line>With faint illumination, that uplifts</line>
      <line> The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits</line>
      <line>Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame.</line>
      <line>Not undelightful is an hour to me</line>
      <line>So spent in parlour-twilight: such a gloom</line>
      <line>Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,</line>
      <line>The mind contemplative, with some new theme</line>
      <line>Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all.</line>
      <line>Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers –</line>
      <line>That never feel a stupor, know no pause,</line>
      <line>Nor need one – I am conscious, and confess,</line>
      <line> Fearless, a soul that does not always think.</line>
      <line>Me oft has fancy, ludicrous and wild,</line>
      <line>Soothed with a waking dream of houses, towers,</line>
      <line>Trees, churches, and strange visages, expressed</line>
      <line>In the red cinders, while with poring eye</line>
      <line>I gazed, myself creating what I saw.</line>
      <line>Nor less amused have I quiescent watched</line>
      <line>The sooty films that play upon the bars,</line>
      <line>Pendulous, and foreboding, in the view</line>
      <line>Of superstition – prophesying still,</line>
      <line> Though still deceived – some stranger’s near approach.</line>
      <line>’Tis thus the understanding takes repose</line>
      <line>In indolent vacuity of thought,</line>
      <line>And sleeps and is refreshed. Meanwhile the face</line>
      <line>Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask</line>
      <line>Of deep deliberation, as the man</line>
      <line>Were tasked to his full strength, absorbed and lost.</line>
      <line>Thus oft, reclined at ease, I lose an hour</line>
      <line>At evening, till at length the freezing blast,</line>
      <line>That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home</line>
      <line>The recollected powers, and, snapping short</line>
      <line>The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves</line>
      <line>Her brittle toys, restores me to myself.</line>
      <line>How calm is my recess – and how the frost,</line>
      <line>Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear</line>
      <line>The silence and the warmth within!</line>
      <line>I saw the woods and fields, at close of day,</line>
      <line>A variegated show: the meadows green,</line>
      <line>Though faded; and the lands where lately waved</line>
      <line>The golden harvest, of a mellow brown,</line>
      <line> Upturned so lately by the forceful share.</line>
      <line>I saw far off the weedy fallows smile</line>
      <line>With verdure not unprofitable, grazed</line>
      <line>By flocks, fast feeding and selecting each</line>
      <line>His favourite herb – while all the leafless groves</line>
      <line>That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue,</line>
      <line>Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.</line>
      <line>Tomorrow brings a change, a total change!</line>
      <line>Which even now – though silently performed,</line>
      <line>And slowly, and by most unfelt – the face</line>
      <line> Of universal Nature undergoes.</line>
      <line>Fast falls a fleecy shower: the downy flakes,</line>
      <line>Descending, and with never-ceasing lapse</line>
      <line>Softly alighting upon all below,</line>
      <line>Assimilate all objects. Earth receives</line>
      <line>Gladly the thickening mantle, and the green</line>
      <line>And tender blade that feared the chilling blast</line>
      <line>Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.</line>

    <title>The Eolian Harp</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>My pensive Sara! – thy soft cheek reclined</line>
      <line>Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is</line>
      <line>To sit beside our cot, our cot o’ergrown</line>
      <line>With white-flowered jasmine and the broad-leaved myrtle</line>
      <line> (Meet emblems they of innocence and love),</line>
      <line>And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light,</line>
      <line>Slow saddening round, and mark the Star of Eve</line>
      <line>Serenely brilliant (such should wisdom be)</line>
      <line>Shine opposite. How exquisite the scents</line>
      <line>Snatched from yon bean-field – and the world so hushed!</line>
      <line>The stilly murmur of the distant sea</line>
      <line>Tells us of silence.</line>
      <line>And that simplest lute,</line>
      <line>Placed lengthways in the clasping casement – hark</line>
      <line>How, by the desultory breeze caressed</line>
      <line> Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover,</line>
      <line>It pours such sweet upbraiding as must needs</line>
      <line>Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings</line>
      <line>Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes</line>
      <line>Over delicious surges sink and rise –</line>
      <line>Such a soft floating witchery of sound</line>
      <line>As twilight elfins make, when they at eve</line>
      <line>Voyage on gentle gales from Faery Land,</line>
      <line>Where melodies round honey-dropping flowers</line>
      <line>(Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise)</line>
      <line> Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing!</line>
      <line>And thus, my love, as on the midway slope</line>
      <line>Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon,</line>
      <line>Whilst through my half-closed eyelids I behold</line>
      <line>The sunbeams dance like diamonds on the main,</line>
      <line>And tranquil muse upon tranquillity,</line>
      <line>Full many a thought uncalled and undetained,</line>
      <line>And many idle flitting fantasies,</line>
      <line>Traverse my indolent and passive brain –</line>
      <line>As wild and various as the random gales</line>
      <line> That swell and flutter on this subject lute!</line>
      <line>And what if all of animated Nature</line>
      <line>Be but organic harps, diversely framed,</line>
      <line>That tremble into thought as o’er them sweeps,</line>
      <line>Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze,</line>
      <line>At once the soul of each, and God of all?</line>
      <line>But thy more serious eye a mild reproof</line>
      <line>Darts, oh belovéd woman – nor such thoughts,</line>
      <line>Dim and unhallowed, dost thou not reject –</line>
      <line>And biddest me walk humbly with my God.</line>
      <line> Meek daughter in the family of Christ,</line>
      <line>Well hast thou said – and holily dispraised</line>
      <line>These shapings of the unregenerate mind,</line>
      <line>Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break</line>
      <line>On vain Philosophy’s aye-babbling spring!</line>
      <line>For never guiltless may I speak of him,</line>
      <line>The Incomprehensible, save when with awe</line>
      <line>I praise him, and with faith that inly feels,</line>
      <line>Who with his saving mercies healéd me,</line>
      <line>A sinful and most miserable man,</line>
      <line> Wildered and dark, and gave me to possess</line>
      <line>Peace, and this cot, and thee, heart-honoured maid!</line>

    <title>This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well, they are gone, and here must I remain,</line>
      <line>This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost</line>
      <line>Such beauties and such feelings as had been</line>
      <line>Most sweet to have remembered, even when age</line>
      <line> Had dimmed my eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile,</line>
      <line>My friends, whom I may never meet again,</line>
      <line>On springy heath along the hilltop edge</line>
      <line>Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,</line>
      <line>To that still roaring dell of which I told</line>
      <line>(The roaring dell, o’erwooded, narrow, deep,</line>
      <line>And only speckled by the mid-day sun),</line>
      <line>Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock</line>
      <line>Flings arching like a bridge – that branchless ash,</line>
      <line>Unsunned and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves</line>
      <line> Ne’er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,</line>
      <line>Fanned by the waterfall! And there my friends</line>
      <line>Behold the dark-green file of long lank weeds,</line>
      <line>That all at once – a most fantastic sight! –</line>
      <line>Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge</line>
      <line>Of the dim clay-stone.</line>
      <line>Now my friends emerge</line>
      <line>Beneath the wide wide heaven, and view again</line>
      <line>The many-steepled tract magnificent</line>
      <line>Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,</line>
      <line>With some fair bark, perhaps, which lightly touches</line>
      <line> The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two isles</line>
      <line>Of purple shadow! Yes, they wander on</line>
      <line>In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,</line>
      <line>My gentle-hearted Charles! For thou hast pined</line>
      <line>And hungered after Nature many a year</line>
      <line>In the great city pent, winning thy way</line>
      <line>With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain</line>
      <line>And strange calamity! Ah, slowly sink</line>
      <line>Behind the western ridge, thou glorious sun!</line>
      <line>Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,</line>
      <line> Ye purple heath-flowers! Richlier burn, ye clouds!</line>
      <line>Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves!</line>
      <line>And kindle, thou blue ocean! So my friend</line>
      <line>Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,</line>
      <line>Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round</line>
      <line>On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem</line>
      <line>Less gross than bodily; a living thing</line>
      <line>Which acts upon the mind – and with such hues</line>
      <line>As clothe the Almighty Spirit when he makes</line>
      <line>Spirits perceive his presence.</line>
      <line>A delight</line>
      <line> Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad</line>
      <line>As I myself were there! Nor in this bower,</line>
      <line>This little lime-tree bower, have I not marked</line>
      <line>Much that has soothed me. Pale beneath the blaze</line>
      <line>Hung the transparent foliage, and I watched</line>
      <line>Some broad and sunny leaf, and loved to see</line>
      <line>The shadow of the leaf and stem above</line>
      <line>Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree</line>
      <line>Was richly tinged, and a deep radiance lay</line>
      <line>Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps</line>
      <line> Those fronting elms – and now, with blackest mass,</line>
      <line>Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue</line>
      <line>Through the late twilight. And though now the bat</line>
      <line>Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,</line>
      <line>Yet still the solitary humble-bee</line>
      <line>Sings in the bean-flower!</line>
      <line>Henceforth I shall know</line>
      <line>That Nature ne’er deserts the wise and pure –</line>
      <line>No scene so narrow but may well employ</line>
      <line>Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart</line>
      <line>Awake to love and beauty! And sometimes</line>
      <line> ’Tis well to be bereft of promised good,</line>
      <line>That we may lift the soul, and contemplate</line>
      <line>With lively joy the joys we cannot share.</line>
      <line>My gentle-hearted Charles, when the last rook</line>
      <line>Beat its straight path along the dusky air</line>
      <line>Homewards, I blest it! – deeming its black wing</line>
      <line>(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)</line>
      <line>Had crossed the mighty orb’s dilated glory</line>
      <line>While thou stoodst gazing; or, when all was still,</line>
      <line>Flew creeking o’er thy head, and had a charm</line>
      <line> For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom</line>
      <line>No sound is dissonant which tells of life.</line>

    <title>Frost at Midnight</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The frost performs its secret ministry,</line>
      <line>Unhelped by any wind. The owlet’s cry</line>
      <line>Came loud – and hark, again – loud as before!</line>
      <line>The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,</line>
      <line> Have left me to that solitude which suits</line>
      <line>Abstruser musings – save that at my side</line>
      <line>My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.</line>
      <line>’Tis calm indeed – so calm that it disturbs</line>
      <line>And vexes meditation with its strange</line>
      <line>And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood,</line>
      <line>This populous village – sea, and hill, and wood,</line>
      <line>With all the numberless goings-on of life,</line>
      <line>Inaudible as dreams! The thin blue flame</line>
      <line>Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not.</line>
      <line> Only that film, which fluttered on the grate,</line>
      <line>Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing!</line>
      <line>Methinks, its motion in this hush of Nature</line>
      <line>Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,</line>
      <line>Making it a companionable form,</line>
      <line>With which I can hold commune. Idle thought!</line>
      <line>But still the living spirit in our frame,</line>
      <line>That loves not to behold a lifeless thing,</line>
      <line>Transfuses into all its own delights,</line>
      <line>Its own volition, sometimes with deep faith,</line>
      <line> And sometimes with fantastic playfulness.</line>
      <line>Ah me! amused by no such curious toys,</line>
      <line>How often in my early schoolboy days,</line>
      <line>With most believing superstitious wish</line>
      <line>Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars</line>
      <line>To watch the stranger there!</line>
      <line>And oft, belike,</line>
      <line>With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt</line>
      <line>Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,</line>
      <line>Whose bells, the poor man’s only music, rang</line>
      <line>From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,</line>
      <line> So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me</line>
      <line>With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear</line>
      <line>Most like articulate sounds of things to come.</line>
      <line>So gazed I, till the soothing things I dreamt</line>
      <line>Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!</line>
      <line>And so I brooded all the following morn,</line>
      <line>Awed by the stern preceptor’s face, mine eye</line>
      <line>Fixed with mock study on my swimming book;</line>
      <line>Save if the door half opened, and I snatched</line>
      <line>A hasty glance – and still my heart leapt up,</line>
      <line> For still I hoped to see the stranger’s face,</line>
      <line>Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,</line>
      <line>My play-mate when we both were clothed alike!</line>
      <line>Dear babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,</line>
      <line>Whose gentle breathings, heard in this dead calm,</line>
      <line>Fill up the interspersed vacancies</line>
      <line>And momentary pauses of the thought!</line>
      <line>My babe so beautiful, it thrills my heart</line>
      <line>With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,</line>
      <line> And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,</line>
      <line>And in far other scenes! For I was reared</line>
      <line>In the great city, pent mid cloisters dim,</line>
      <line>And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.</line>
      <line>But thou, my babe, shalt wander like a breeze</line>
      <line>By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags</line>
      <line>Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,</line>
      <line>Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores</line>
      <line>And mountain-crags. So shalt thou see and hear</line>
      <line>The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible</line>
      <line> Of that eternal language which thy God</line>
      <line>Utters, who from eternity doth teach</line>
      <line>Himself in all, and all things in himself.</line>
      <line>Great universal Teacher – he shall mould</line>
      <line>Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask!</line>
      <line>Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,</line>
      <line>Whether the summer clothe the general earth</line>
      <line>With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing</line>
      <line>Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch</line>
      <line>Of mossy apple-tree, while all the thatch</line>
      <line> Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall</line>
      <line>Heard only in the trances of the blast,</line>
      <line>Or whether the secret ministry of cold</line>
      <line>Shall hang them up in silent icicles,</line>
      <line>Quietly shining to the quiet moon –</line>
      <line>Like those, my babe, which, ere tomorrow’s warmth</line>
      <line>Have capped their sharp keen points with pendulous drops,</line>
      <line>Will catch thine eye, and with their novelty</line>
      <line>Suspend thy little soul, then make thee shout</line>
      <line>And stretch and flutter from thy mother’s arms</line>
      <line> As thou wouldst fly for very eagerness.</line>

    <title>The Nightingale</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>No cloud, no relic of the sunken day,</line>
      <line>Distinguishes the west, no long thin slip</line>
      <line>Of sullen light, no obscure trembling hues.</line>
      <line>Come, we will rest on this old mossy bridge!</line>
      <line> You see the glimmer of the stream beneath,</line>
      <line>But hear no murmuring: it flows silently</line>
      <line>O’er its soft bed of verdure. All is still,</line>
      <line>A balmy night! And though the stars be dim,</line>
      <line>Yet let us think upon the vernal showers</line>
      <line>That gladden the green earth, and we shall find</line>
      <line>A pleasure in the dimness of the stars.</line>
      <line>And hark, the nightingale begins its song,</line>
      <line>‘Most musical, most melancholy’!</line>
      <line>A melancholy bird? Oh idle thought:</line>
      <line> In Nature there is nothing melancholy.</line>
      <line>But some night-wandering man, whose heart was pierced</line>
      <line>With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,</line>
      <line>Or slow distemper, or neglected love,</line>
      <line>And so, poor wretch! filled all things with himself</line>
      <line>And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale</line>
      <line>Of his own sorrows – he, and such as he,</line>
      <line>First named these notes a melancholy strain,</line>
      <line>And many a poet echoes the conceit,</line>
      <line>Poet, who hath been building up the rhyme</line>
      <line> When he had better far have stretched his limbs</line>
      <line>Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell</line>
      <line>By sun or moonlight, to the influxes</line>
      <line>Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements</line>
      <line>Surrendering his whole spirit, of his song</line>
      <line>And of his fame forgetful! So his fame</line>
      <line>Should share in Nature’s immortality –</line>
      <line>A venerable thing – and so his song</line>
      <line>Should make all Nature lovelier, and itself</line>
      <line>Be loved, like Nature. But ’twill not be so;</line>
      <line> And youths and maidens most poetical</line>
      <line>Who lose the deepening twilights of the spring</line>
      <line>In ball-rooms and hot theatres, they still</line>
      <line>(Full of meek sympathy) must heave their sighs</line>
      <line>O’er Philomela’s pity-pleading strains!</line>
      <line>My friend, and my friend’s sister! we have learnt</line>
      <line>A different lore: we may not thus profane</line>
      <line>Nature’s sweet voices, always full of love</line>
      <line>And joyance! ’Tis the merry nightingale</line>
      <line>That crowds, and hurries, and precipitates,</line>
      <line> With fast thick warble, his delicious notes,</line>
      <line>As he were fearful, that an April night</line>
      <line>Would be too short for him to utter forth</line>
      <line>His love-chant, and disburden his full soul</line>
      <line>Of all its music! And I know a grove</line>
      <line>Of large extent, hard by a castle huge</line>
      <line>Which the great lord inhabits not; and so</line>
      <line>This grove is wild with tangling underwood,</line>
      <line>And the trim walks are broken up, and grass,</line>
      <line>Thin grass and king-cups, grow within the paths –</line>
      <line> But never elsewhere in one place I knew</line>
      <line>So many nightingales! And far and near,</line>
      <line>In wood and thicket, over the wide grove</line>
      <line>They answer and provoke each other’s songs</line>
      <line>With skirmish and capricious passagings,</line>
      <line>And murmurs musical, and swift jug jug,</line>
      <line>And one low piping sound more sweet than all,</line>
      <line>Stirring the air with such an harmony</line>
      <line>That, should you close your eyes, you might almost</line>
      <line>Forget it was not day! On moonlight bushes,</line>
      <line> Whose dewy leafits are but half disclosed,</line>
      <line>You may perchance behold them on the twigs,</line>
      <line>Their bright, bright eyes – their eyes both bright and full –</line>
      <line>Glistening, while many a glow-worm in the shade</line>
      <line>Lights up her love-torch.</line>
      <line>A most gentle maid</line>
      <line>Who dwelleth in her hospitable home</line>
      <line>Hard by the Castle, and at latest eve</line>
      <line>(Even like a lady vowed and dedicate</line>
      <line>To something more than Nature in the grove)</line>
      <line>Glides through the pathways. She knows all their notes,</line>
      <line> That gentle maid! and oft, a moment’s space,</line>
      <line>What time the moon was lost behind a cloud,</line>
      <line>Hath heard a pause of silence – till the moon,</line>
      <line>Emerging, hath awakened earth and sky</line>
      <line>With one sensation, and those wakeful birds</line>
      <line>Have all burst forth in choral minstrelsy,</line>
      <line>As if one quick and sudden gale had swept</line>
      <line>An hundred airy harps! And she hath watched</line>
      <line>Many a nightingale perch giddily</line>
      <line>On blossomy twig still swinging from the breeze,</line>
      <line> And to that motion tune his wanton song</line>
      <line>Like tipsy joy that reels with tossing head.</line>
      <line>Farewell, oh warbler, till tomorrow eve!</line>
      <line>And you, my friends, farewell – a short farewell!</line>
      <line>We have been loitering long and pleasantly,</line>
      <line>And now for our dear homes. That strain again –</line>
      <line>Full fain it would delay me! My dear babe,</line>
      <line>Who, capable of no articulate sound,</line>
      <line>Mars all things with his imitative lisp,</line>
      <line>How he would place his hand beside his ear</line>
      <line> (His little hand), the small forefinger up,</line>
      <line>And bid us listen! And I deem it wise</line>
      <line>To make him Nature’s playmate. He knows well</line>
      <line>The evening star – and once when he awoke</line>
      <line>In most distressful mood (some inward pain</line>
      <line>Had made up that strange thing, an infant’s dream)</line>
      <line>I hurried with him to our orchard-plot,</line>
      <line>And he beholds the moon, and, hushed at once,</line>
      <line>Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,</line>
      <line>While his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears</line>
      <line>Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam!</line>
      <line>Well,</line>
      <line>It is a father’s tale. But if that Heaven</line>
      <line>Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up</line>
      <line>Familiar with these songs, that with the night</line>
      <line>He may associate joy! Once more farewell,</line>
      <line>Sweet nightingale! Once more, my friends, farewell!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Five years have passed, five summers, with the length</line>
      <line>Of five long winters, and again I hear</line>
      <line>These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs</line>
      <line>With a sweet inland murmur. Once again</line>
      <line> Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,</line>
      <line>Which on a wild secluded scene impress</line>
      <line>Thoughts of more deep seclusion, and connect</line>
      <line>The landscape with the quiet of the sky.</line>
      <line>The day is come when I again repose</line>
      <line>Here, under this dark sycamore, and view</line>
      <line>These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts</line>
      <line>Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,</line>
      <line>Among the woods and copses lose themselves,</line>
      <line>Nor with their green and simple hue disturb</line>
      <line> The wild green landscape. Once again I see</line>
      <line>These hedgerows – hardly hedgerows, little lines</line>
      <line>Of sportive wood run wild – these pastoral farms</line>
      <line>Green to the very door, and wreaths of smoke</line>
      <line>Sent up, in silence, from among the trees</line>
      <line>With some uncertain notice, as might seem</line>
      <line>Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,</line>
      <line>Or of some hermit’s cave, where by his fire</line>
      <line>The hermit sits alone.</line>
      <line>Though absent long,</line>
      <line>These forms of beauty have not been to me</line>
      <line> As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye;</line>
      <line>But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din</line>
      <line>Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,</line>
      <line>In hours of weariness, sensations sweet</line>
      <line>Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,</line>
      <line>And passing even into my purer mind</line>
      <line>With tranquil restoration – feelings too</line>
      <line>Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,</line>
      <line>As may have had no trivial influence</line>
      <line>On that best portion of a good man’s life,</line>
      <line> His little nameless unremembered acts</line>
      <line>Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,</line>
      <line>To them I may have owed another gift,</line>
      <line>Of aspect more sublime: that blesséd mood</line>
      <line>In which the burden of the mystery,</line>
      <line>In which the heavy and the weary weight</line>
      <line>Of all this unintelligible world,</line>
      <line>Is lightened – that serene and blesséd mood</line>
      <line>In which the affections gently lead us on,</line>
      <line>Until, the breath of this corporeal frame</line>
      <line> And even the motion of our human blood</line>
      <line>Almost suspended, we are laid asleep</line>
      <line>In body, and become a living soul,</line>
      <line>While, with an eye made quiet by the power</line>
      <line>Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,</line>
      <line>We see into the life of things.</line>
      <line>If this</line>
      <line>Be but a vain belief, yet oh, how oft,</line>
      <line>In darkness, and amid the many shapes</line>
      <line>Of joyless daylight, when the fretful stir</line>
      <line>Unprofitable and the fever of the world</line>
      <line> Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,</line>
      <line>How oft in spirit have I turned to thee</line>
      <line>Oh sylvan Wye, thou wanderer through the woods –</line>
      <line>How often has my spirit turned to thee!</line>
      <line>And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,</line>
      <line>With many recognitions dim and faint,</line>
      <line>And somewhat of a sad perplexity,</line>
      <line>The picture of the mind revives again,</line>
      <line>While here I stand, not only with the sense</line>
      <line>Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts</line>
      <line> That in this moment there is life and food</line>
      <line>For future years. And so I dare to hope</line>
      <line>Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first</line>
      <line>I came among these hills, when like a roe</line>
      <line>I bounded o’er the mountains, by the sides</line>
      <line>Of the deep rivers and the lonely streams,</line>
      <line>Wherever Nature led – more like a man</line>
      <line>Flying from something that he dreads, than one</line>
      <line>Who sought the thing he loved. For Nature then</line>
      <line>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</line>
      <line> And their glad animal movements, all gone by)</line>
      <line>To me was all in all. I cannot paint</line>
      <line>What then I was. The sounding cataract</line>
      <line>Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,</line>
      <line>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</line>
      <line>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</line>
      <line>An appetite – a feeling and a love</line>
      <line>That had no need of a remoter charm</line>
      <line>By thought supplied, or any interest</line>
      <line>Unborrowed from the eye.</line>
      <line>That time is past,</line>
      <line> And all its aching joys are now no more,</line>
      <line>And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this</line>
      <line>Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur: other gifts</line>
      <line>Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,</line>
      <line>Abundant recompense. For I have learned</line>
      <line>To look on Nature, not as in the hour</line>
      <line>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</line>
      <line>The still, sad music of humanity,</line>
      <line>Nor harsh, nor grating, though of ample power</line>
      <line>To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</line>
      <line> A presence that disturbs me with the joy</line>
      <line>Of elevated thoughts, a sense sublime</line>
      <line>Of something far more deeply interfused,</line>
      <line>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</line>
      <line>And the round ocean, and the living air,</line>
      <line>And the blue sky, and in the mind of man –</line>
      <line>A motion and a spirit that impels</line>
      <line>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</line>
      <line>And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still</line>
      <line>A lover of the meadows and the woods</line>
      <line>And mountains, and of all that we behold</line>
      <line>From this green earth – of all the mighty world</line>
      <line>Of eye and ear, both what they half-create,</line>
      <line>And what perceive – well pleased to recognize</line>
      <line>In Nature and the language of the sense</line>
      <line>The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,</line>
      <line>The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul</line>
      <line>Of all my moral being.</line>
      <line>Nor perchance</line>
      <line>If I were not thus taught, should I the more</line>
      <line>Suffer my genial spirits to decay;</line>
      <line> For thou art with me, here, upon the banks</line>
      <line>Of this fair river – thou, my dearest friend,</line>
      <line>My dear, dear friend – and in thy voice I catch</line>
      <line>The language of my former heart, and read</line>
      <line>My former pleasures in the shooting lights</line>
      <line>Of thy wild eyes. Oh, yet a little while</line>
      <line>May I behold in thee what I was once,</line>
      <line>My dear, dear sister. And this prayer I make,</line>
      <line>Knowing that Nature never did betray</line>
      <line>The heart that loved her: ’tis her privilege</line>
      <line> Through all the years of this our life to lead</line>
      <line>From joy to joy. For she can so inform</line>
      <line>The mind that is within us, so impress</line>
      <line>With quietness and beauty, and so feed</line>
      <line>With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,</line>
      <line>Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,</line>
      <line>Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all</line>
      <line>The dreary intercourse of daily life,</line>
      <line>Shall e’er prevail against us, or disturb</line>
      <line>Our cheerful faith that all which we behold</line>
      <line> Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon</line>
      <line>Shine on thee in thy solitary walk,</line>
      <line>And let the misty mountain winds be free</line>
      <line>To blow against thee; and in after years,</line>
      <line>When these wild ecstasies shall be matured</line>
      <line>Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind</line>
      <line>Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,</line>
      <line>Thy memory be as a dwelling-place</line>
      <line>For all sweet sounds and harmonies – oh, then</line>
      <line>If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,</line>
      <line> Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts</line>
      <line>Of tender joy wilt thou remember me</line>
      <line>And these my exhortations!</line>
      <line>Nor perchance</line>
      <line>If I should be where I no more can hear</line>
      <line>Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams</line>
      <line>Of past existence, wilt thou then forget</line>
      <line>That on the banks of this delightful stream</line>
      <line>We stood together, and that I, so long</line>
      <line>A worshipper of Nature, hither came</line>
      <line>Unwearied in that service – rather say</line>
      <line> With warmer love, oh, with far deeper zeal</line>
      <line>Of holier love! Nor wilt thou then forget</line>
      <line>That after many wanderings, many years</line>
      <line>Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,</line>
      <line>And this green pastoral landscape, were to me</line>
      <line>More dear, both for themselves, and for thy sake.</line>

    <title>There Was a Boy</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was a boy – ye knew him well, ye cliffs</line>
      <line>And islands of Winander – many a time</line>
      <line>At evening, when the stars had just begun</line>
      <line>To move along the edges of the hills,</line>
      <line> Rising or setting, would he stand alone</line>
      <line>Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,</line>
      <line>And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands</line>
      <line>Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth</line>
      <line>Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,</line>
      <line>Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,</line>
      <line>That they might answer him. And they would shout</line>
      <line>Across the watery vale, and shout again,</line>
      <line>Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,</line>
      <line>And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud,</line>
      <line> Redoubled and redoubled – a wild scene</line>
      <line>Of mirth and jocund din. And when it chanced</line>
      <line>That pauses of deep silence mocked his skill,</line>
      <line>Then sometimes in that silence, while he hung</line>
      <line>Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise</line>
      <line>Has carried far into his heart the voice</line>
      <line>Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene</line>
      <line>Would enter unawares into his mind</line>
      <line>With all its solemn imagery – its rocks,</line>
      <line>Its woods, and that uncertain heaven – received</line>
      <line> Into the bosom of the steady lake.</line>

    <title>The Two-Part Prelude</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Was it for this</line>
      <line>That one, the fairest of all rivers, loved</line>
      <line>To blend his murmurs with my nurse’s song,</line>
      <line>And from his alder shades and rocky falls,</line>
      <line> And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice</line>
      <line>That flowed along my dreams? For this didst thou,</line>
      <line>Oh Derwent, travelling over the green plains</line>
      <line>Near my ‘sweet birthplace’, didst thou, beauteous stream,</line>
      <line>Make ceaseless music through the night and day,</line>
      <line>Which with its steady cadence tempering</line>
      <line>Our human waywardness, composed my thoughts</line>
      <line>To more than infant softness, giving me</line>
      <line>Among the fretful dwellings of mankind</line>
      <line>A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm</line>
      <line> Which Nature breathes among the fields and groves?</line>
      <line>Belovéd Derwent, fairest of all streams,</line>
      <line>Was it for this that I, a four years’ child,</line>
      <line>A naked boy, among thy silent pools</line>
      <line>Made one long bathing of a summer’s day,</line>
      <line>Basked in the sun, or plunged into thy streams,</line>
      <line>Alternate, all a summer’s day, or coursed</line>
      <line>Over the sandy fields, and dashed the flowers</line>
      <line>Of yellow groundsel – or, when crag and hill,</line>
      <line>The woods, and distant Skiddaw’s lofty height,</line>
      <line> Were bronzed with a deep radiance, stood alone</line>
      <line>A naked savage in the thunder-shower?</line>
      <line>And afterwards (’twas in a later day,</line>
      <line>Though early), when upon the mountain-slope</line>
      <line>The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapped</line>
      <line>The last autumnal crocus, ’twas my joy</line>
      <line>To wander half the night among the cliffs</line>
      <line>And the smooth hollows where the woodcocks ran</line>
      <line>Along the moonlight turf. In thought and wish</line>
      <line>That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,</line>
      <line> I was a fell destroyer. Gentle powers,</line>
      <line>Who give us happiness and call it peace,</line>
      <line>When scudding on from snare to snare I plied</line>
      <line>My anxious visitation, hurrying on,</line>
      <line>Still hurrying, hurrying onward, how my heart</line>
      <line>Panted! – among the scattered yew-trees and the crags</line>
      <line>That looked upon me, how my bosom beat</line>
      <line>With expectation! Sometimes strong desire</line>
      <line>Resistless overpowered me, and the bird</line>
      <line>Which was the captive of another’s toils</line>
      <line> Became my prey; and when the deed was done</line>
      <line>I heard among the solitary hills</line>
      <line>Low breathings coming after me, and sounds</line>
      <line>Of undistinguishable motion, steps</line>
      <line>Almost as silent as the turf they trod.</line>
      <line>Nor less in springtime, when on southern banks</line>
      <line>The shining sun had from his knot of leaves</line>
      <line>Decoyed the primrose flower, and when the vales</line>
      <line>And woods were warm, was I a rover then</line>
      <line>In the high places, on the lonesome peaks,</line>
      <line> Among the mountains and the winds. Though mean</line>
      <line>And though inglorious were my views, the end</line>
      <line>Was not ignoble. Oh, when I have hung</line>
      <line>Above the raven’s nest, by knots of grass</line>
      <line>Or half-inch fissures in the slippery rock</line>
      <line>But ill sustained, and almost, as it seemed,</line>
      <line>Suspended by the blast which blew amain</line>
      <line>Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time,</line>
      <line>While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,</line>
      <line>With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind</line>
      <line> Blow through my ears; the sky seemed not a sky</line>
      <line>Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds!</line>
      <line>The mind of man is fashioned and built up</line>
      <line>Even as a strain of music. I believe</line>
      <line>That there are spirits which, when they would form</line>
      <line>A favoured being, from his very dawn</line>
      <line>Of infancy do open out the clouds</line>
      <line>As at the touch of lightning, seeking him</line>
      <line>With gentle visitation – quiet powers,</line>
      <line>Retired, and seldom recognized, yet kind,</line>
      <line> And to the very meanest not unknown –</line>
      <line>With me, though, rarely in my boyish days</line>
      <line>They communed. Others too there are, who use,</line>
      <line>Yet haply aiming at the self-same end,</line>
      <line>Severer interventions, ministry</line>
      <line>More palpable – and of their school was I.</line>
      <line>They guided me: one evening led by them</line>
      <line>I went alone into a shepherd’s boat,</line>
      <line>A skiff, that to a willow-tree was tied</line>
      <line>Within a rocky cave, its usual home.</line>
      <line> The moon was up, the lake was shining clear</line>
      <line>Among the hoary mountains; from the shore</line>
      <line>I pushed, and struck the oars, and struck again</line>
      <line>In cadence, and my little boat moved on</line>
      <line>Just like a man who walks with stately step</line>
      <line>Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth</line>
      <line>And troubled pleasure. Not without the voice</line>
      <line>Of mountain echoes did my boat move on,</line>
      <line>Leaving behind her still on either side</line>
      <line>Small circles glittering idly in the moon,</line>
      <line> Until they melted all into one track</line>
      <line>Of sparkling light.</line>
      <line>A rocky steep uprose</line>
      <line>Above the cavern of the willow-tree,</line>
      <line>And now, as suited one who proudly rowed</line>
      <line>With his best skill, I fixed a steady view</line>
      <line>Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,</line>
      <line>The bound of the horizon – for behind</line>
      <line>Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.</line>
      <line>She was an elfin pinnace; twenty times</line>
      <line>I dipped my oars into the silent lake,</line>
      <line>And as I rose upon the stroke my boat</line>
      <line>Went heaving through the water like a swan –</line>
      <line>When from behind that rocky steep, till then</line>
      <line>The bound of the horizon, a huge cliff,</line>
      <line>As if with voluntary power instinct,</line>
      <line>Upreared its head. I struck, and struck again,</line>
      <line>And, growing still in stature, the huge cliff</line>
      <line>Rose up between me and the stars, and still,</line>
      <line>With measured motion, like a living thing</line>
      <line>Strode after me. With trembling hands I turned,</line>
      <line> And through the silent water stole my way</line>
      <line>Back to the cavern of the willow-tree.</line>
      <line>There in her mooring-place I left my bark,</line>
      <line>And through the meadows homeward went with grave</line>
      <line>And serious thoughts; and after I had seen</line>
      <line>That spectacle, for many days my brain</line>
      <line>Worked with a dim and undetermined sense</line>
      <line>Of unknown modes of being. In my thoughts</line>
      <line>There was a darkness – call it solitude,</line>
      <line>Or blank desertion – no familiar shapes</line>
      <line> Of hourly objects, images of trees,</line>
      <line>Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields,</line>
      <line>But huge and mighty forms that do not live</line>
      <line>Like living men moved slowly through my mind</line>
      <line>By day, and were the trouble of my dreams.</line>
      <line>Ah, not in vain ye beings of the hills,</line>
      <line>And ye that walk the woods and open heaths</line>
      <line>By moon or starlight, thus, from my first dawn</line>
      <line>Of childhood, did ye love to intertwine</line>
      <line>The passions that build up our human soul</line>
      <line> Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,</line>
      <line>But with high objects, with eternal things,</line>
      <line>With life and Nature, purifying thus</line>
      <line>The elements of feeling and of thought,</line>
      <line>And sanctifying by such discipline</line>
      <line>Both pain and fear, until we recognize</line>
      <line>A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.</line>
      <line>Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me</line>
      <line>With stinted kindness. In November days,</line>
      <line>When vapours rolling down the valleys made</line>
      <line> A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods</line>
      <line>At noon, and mid the calm of summer nights</line>
      <line>When by the margin of the trembling lake</line>
      <line>Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went</line>
      <line>In solitude, such intercourse was mine.</line>
      <line>And in the frosty season, when the sun</line>
      <line>Was set, and visible for many a mile</line>
      <line>The cottage windows through the twilight blazed,</line>
      <line>I heeded not the summons. Clear and loud</line>
      <line>The village-clock tolled six; I wheeled about</line>
      <line> Proud and exulting, like an untired horse</line>
      <line>That cares not for its home. All shod with steel</line>
      <line>We hissed along the polished ice in games</line>
      <line>Confederate, imitative of the chase</line>
      <line>And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,</line>
      <line>The pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.</line>
      <line>So through the darkness and the cold we flew,</line>
      <line>And not a voice was idle. With the din,</line>
      <line>Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud;</line>
      <line>The leafless trees and every icy crag</line>
      <line> Tinkled like iron; while the distant hills</line>
      <line>Into the tumult sent an alien sound</line>
      <line>Of melancholy, not unnoticed; while the stars,</line>
      <line>Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west</line>
      <line>The orange sky of evening died away.</line>
      <line>Not seldom from the uproar I retired</line>
      <line>Into a silent bay, or sportively</line>
      <line>Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,</line>
      <line>To cut across the shadow of a star</line>
      <line>That gleamed upon the ice. And oftentimes</line>
      <line> When we had given our bodies to the wind</line>
      <line>And all the shadowy banks on either side</line>
      <line>Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still</line>
      <line>The rapid line of motion, then at once</line>
      <line>Have I, reclining back upon my heels,</line>
      <line>Stopped short – yet still the solitary cliffs</line>
      <line>Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had rolled</line>
      <line>With visible motion her diurnal round.</line>
      <line>Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,</line>
      <line>Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched</line>
      <line> Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.</line>
      <line>Ye powers of earth, ye genii of the springs,</line>
      <line>And ye that have your voices in the clouds,</line>
      <line>And ye that are familiars of the lakes</line>
      <line>And of the standing pools, I may not think</line>
      <line>A vulgar hope was yours when ye employed</line>
      <line>Such ministry – when ye through many a year</line>
      <line>Thus by the agency of boyish sports,</line>
      <line>On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,</line>
      <line>Impressed upon all forms the characters</line>
      <line> Of danger or desire, and thus did make</line>
      <line>The surface of the universal earth</line>
      <line>With meanings of delight, of hope and fear,</line>
      <line>Work like a sea.</line>
      <line>Not uselessly employed,</line>
      <line>I might pursue this theme through every change</line>
      <line>Of exercise and sport to which the year</line>
      <line>Did summon us in its delightful round.</line>
      <line>We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven</line>
      <line>Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,</line>
      <line>Nor saw a race in happiness and joy</line>
      <line>More worthy of the fields where they were sown.</line>
      <line>I would record with no reluctant voice</line>
      <line>Our home amusements by the warm peat fire</line>
      <line>At evening, when with pencil and with slate,</line>
      <line>In square divisions parcelled out, and all</line>
      <line>With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o’er,</line>
      <line>We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head,</line>
      <line>In strife too humble to be named in verse;</line>
      <line>Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,</line>
      <line>Cherry, or maple, sat in close array,</line>
      <line> And to the combat – loo or whist – led on</line>
      <line>A thick-ribbed army, not as in the world</line>
      <line>Discarded and ungratefully thrown by</line>
      <line>Even for the very service they had wrought,</line>
      <line>But husbanded through many a long campaign.</line>
      <line>Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell –</line>
      <line>Ironic diamonds, hearts of sable hue,</line>
      <line>Queens gleaming through their splendour’s last decay,</line>
      <line>Knaves wrapped in one assimilating gloom,</line>
      <line>And kings indignant at the shame incurred</line>
      <line> By royal visages. Meanwhile abroad</line>
      <line>The heavy rain was falling, or the frost</line>
      <line>Raged bitterly with keen and silent tooth,</line>
      <line>And, interrupting the impassioned game,</line>
      <line>Oft from the neighbouring lake the splitting ice,</line>
      <line>While it sank down towards the water, sent</line>
      <line>Among the meadows and the hills its long</line>
      <line>And frequent yellings, imitative some</line>
      <line>Of wolves that howl along the Bothnic main.</line>
      <line>Nor with less willing heart would I rehearse</line>
      <line> The woods of autumn, and their hidden bowers</line>
      <line>With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line –</line>
      <line>True symbol of the foolishness of hope –</line>
      <line>Which with its strong enchantment led me on</line>
      <line>By rocks and pools, where never summer star</line>
      <line>Impressed its shadow, to forlorn cascades</line>
      <line>Among the windings of the mountain-brooks;</line>
      <line>The kite in sultry calms from some high hill</line>
      <line>Sent up, ascending thence till it was lost</line>
      <line>Among the fleecy clouds – in gusty days</line>
      <line> Launched from the lower grounds, and suddenly</line>
      <line>Dashed headlong and rejected by the storm.</line>
      <line>All these, and more, with rival claims demand</line>
      <line>Grateful acknowledgement. It were a song</line>
      <line>Venial, and such as (if I rightly judge)</line>
      <line>I might protract unblamed, but I perceive</line>
      <line>That much is overlooked, and we should ill</line>
      <line>Attain our object if, from delicate fears</line>
      <line>Of breaking in upon the unity</line>
      <line>Of this my argument, I should omit</line>
      <line> To speak of such effects as cannot here</line>
      <line>Be regularly classed, yet tend no less</line>
      <line>To the same point – the growth of mental power</line>
      <line>And love of Nature’s works.</line>
      <line>Ere I had seen</line>
      <line>Eight summers (and ’twas in the very week</line>
      <line>When I was first transplanted to thy vale,</line>
      <line>Belovéd Hawkshead! – when thy paths, thy shores</line>
      <line>And brooks, were like a dream of novelty</line>
      <line>To my half-infant mind), I chanced to cross</line>
      <line>One of those open fields which, shaped like ears,</line>
      <line> Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite’s lake.</line>
      <line>Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom</line>
      <line>I saw distinctly on the opposite shore,</line>
      <line>Beneath a tree and close by the lake side,</line>
      <line>A heap of garments, as if left by one</line>
      <line>Who there was bathing. Half an hour I watched</line>
      <line>And no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake</line>
      <line>Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,</line>
      <line>And now and then a leaping fish disturbed</line>
      <line>The breathless stillness.</line>
      <line>The succeeding day</line>
      <line> There came a company, and in their boat</line>
      <line>Sounded with iron hooks and with long poles.</line>
      <line>At length the dead man, mid that beauteous scene</line>
      <line>Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright</line>
      <line>Rose with his ghastly face. I might advert</line>
      <line>To numerous accidents in flood or field,</line>
      <line>Quarry or moor, or mid the winter snows,</line>
      <line>Distresses and disasters, tragic facts</line>
      <line>Of rural history that impressed my mind</line>
      <line>With images to which in following years</line>
      <line> Far other feelings were attached – with forms</line>
      <line>That yet exist with independent life,</line>
      <line>And, like their archetypes, know no decay.</line>
      <line>There are in our existence spots of time</line>
      <line>Which with distinct preeminence retain</line>
      <line>A fructifying virtue, whence, depressed</line>
      <line>By trivial occupations and the round</line>
      <line>Of ordinary intercourse, our minds –</line>
      <line>Especially the imaginative power –</line>
      <line>Are nourished and invisibly repaired.</line>
      <line> Such moments chiefly seem to have their date</line>
      <line>In our first childhood.</line>
      <line>I remember well</line>
      <line>(’Tis of an early season that I speak,</line>
      <line>The twilight of rememberable life),</line>
      <line>While I was yet an urchin, one who scarce</line>
      <line>Could hold a bridle, with ambitious hopes</line>
      <line>I mounted, and we rode towards the hills.</line>
      <line>We were a pair of horsemen: honest James</line>
      <line>Was with me, my encourager and guide.</line>
      <line>We had not travelled long ere some mischance</line>
      <line>Disjoined me from my comrade, and, through fear</line>
      <line>Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor</line>
      <line>I led my horse, and stumbling on, at length</line>
      <line>Came to a bottom where in former times</line>
      <line>A man, the murderer of his wife, was hung</line>
      <line>In irons. Mouldered was the gibbet-mast;</line>
      <line>The bones were gone, the iron and the wood;</line>
      <line>Only a long green ridge of turf remained</line>
      <line>Whose shape was like a grave. I left the spot,</line>
      <line>And reascending the bare slope I saw</line>
      <line> A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,</line>
      <line>The beacon on the summit, and more near</line>
      <line>A girl who bore a pitcher on her head</line>
      <line>And seemed with difficult steps to force her way</line>
      <line>Against the blowing wind. It was in truth</line>
      <line>An ordinary sight, but I should need</line>
      <line>Colours and words that are unknown to man</line>
      <line>To paint the visionary dreariness</line>
      <line>Which, while I looked all round for my lost guide,</line>
      <line>Did at that time invest the naked pool,</line>
      <line> The beacon on the lonely eminence,</line>
      <line>The woman and her garments vexed and tossed</line>
      <line>By the strong wind.</line>
      <line>Nor less I recollect –</line>
      <line>Long after, though my childhood had not ceased –</line>
      <line>Another scene which left a kindred power</line>
      <line>Implanted in my mind. One Christmas-time,</line>
      <line>The day before the holidays began,</line>
      <line>Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth</line>
      <line>Into the fields, impatient for the sight</line>
      <line>Of those three horses which should bear us home,</line>
      <line> My brothers and myself. There was a crag,</line>
      <line>An eminence, which from the meeting-point</line>
      <line>Of two highways ascending overlooked</line>
      <line>At least a long half-mile of those two roads,</line>
      <line>By each of which the expected steeds might come –</line>
      <line>The choice uncertain. Thither I repaired</line>
      <line>Up to the highest summit. ’Twas a day</line>
      <line>Stormy, and rough, and wild, and on the grass</line>
      <line>I sat half sheltered by a naked wall.</line>
      <line>Upon my right hand was a single sheep,</line>
      <line> A whistling hawthorn on my left, and there,</line>
      <line>Those two companions at my side, I watched</line>
      <line>With eyes intensely straining, as the mist</line>
      <line>Gave intermitting prospects of the wood</line>
      <line>And plain beneath.</line>
      <line>Ere I to school returned</line>
      <line>That dreary time, ere I had been ten days</line>
      <line>A dweller in my father’s house, he died,</line>
      <line>And I and my two brothers, orphans then,</line>
      <line>Followed his body to the grave. The event,</line>
      <line>With all the sorrow which it brought, appeared</line>
      <line> A chastisement; and when I called to mind</line>
      <line>That day so lately passed, when from the crag</line>
      <line>I looked in such anxiety of hope,</line>
      <line>With trite reflections of morality,</line>
      <line>Yet with the deepest passion, I bowed low</line>
      <line>To God who thus corrected my desires.</line>
      <line>And afterwards the wind and sleety rain,</line>
      <line>And all the business of the elements,</line>
      <line>The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,</line>
      <line>And the bleak music of that old stone wall,</line>
      <line> The noise of wood and water, and the mist</line>
      <line>Which on the line of each of those two roads</line>
      <line>Advanced in such indisputable shapes –</line>
      <line>All these were spectacles and sounds to which</line>
      <line>I often would repair, and thence would drink</line>
      <line>As at a fountain. And I do not doubt</line>
      <line>That in this later time, when storm and rain</line>
      <line>Beat on my roof at midnight, or by day</line>
      <line>When I am in the woods, unknown to me</line>
      <line>The workings of my spirit thence are brought.</line>
      <line> Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace</line>
      <line>How Nature by collateral interest,</line>
      <line>And by extrinsic passion, peopled first</line>
      <line>My mind with forms or beautiful or grand</line>
      <line>And made me love them, may I well forget</line>
      <line>How other pleasures have been mine, and joys</line>
      <line>Of subtler origin – how I have felt</line>
      <line>Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,</line>
      <line>Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense</line>
      <line>Which seem in their simplicity to own</line>
      <line> An intellectual charm, that calm delight</line>
      <line>Which, if I err not, surely must belong</line>
      <line>To those first-born affinities that fit</line>
      <line>Our new existence to existing things,</line>
      <line>And, in our dawn of being, constitute</line>
      <line>The bond of union betwixt life and joy.</line>
      <line>Yes, I remember when the changeful earth</line>
      <line>And twice five seasons on my mind had stamped</line>
      <line>The faces of the moving year, even then,</line>
      <line>A child, I held unconscious intercourse</line>
      <line> With the eternal beauty, drinking in</line>
      <line>A pure organic pleasure from the lines</line>
      <line>Of curling mist, or from the level plain</line>
      <line>Of waters coloured by the steady clouds.</line>
      <line>The sands of Westmorland, the creeks and bays</line>
      <line>Of Cumbria’s rocky limits, they can tell</line>
      <line>How when the sea threw off his evening shade</line>
      <line>And to the shepherd’s hut beneath the crags</line>
      <line>Did send sweet notice of the rising moon,</line>
      <line>How I have stood, to images like these</line>
      <line>A stranger, linking with the spectacle</line>
      <line>No body of associated forms,</line>
      <line>And bringing with me no peculiar sense</line>
      <line>Of quietness or peace – yet I have stood</line>
      <line>Even while my eye has moved o’er three long leagues</line>
      <line>Of shining water, gathering, as it seemed,</line>
      <line>Through the wide surface of that field of light</line>
      <line>New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.</line>
      <line>Thus often in those fits of vulgar joy</line>
      <line>Which through all seasons on a child’s pursuits</line>
      <line> Are prompt attendants, mid that giddy bliss</line>
      <line>Which like a tempest works along the blood</line>
      <line>And is forgotten, even then I felt</line>
      <line>Gleams like the flashing of a shield. The earth</line>
      <line>And common face of Nature spake to me</line>
      <line>Rememberable things – sometimes, ’tis true,</line>
      <line>By quaint associations, yet not vain</line>
      <line>Nor profitless, if haply they impressed</line>
      <line>Collateral objects and appearances,</line>
      <line>Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep</line>
      <line> Until maturer seasons called them forth</line>
      <line>To impregnate and to elevate the mind.</line>
      <line>And if the vulgar joy by its own weight</line>
      <line>Wearied itself out of the memory,</line>
      <line>The scenes which were a witness of that joy</line>
      <line>Remained, in their substantial lineaments</line>
      <line>Depicted on the brain, and to the eye</line>
      <line>Were visible, a daily sight. And thus</line>
      <line>By the impressive agency of fear,</line>
      <line>By pleasure and repeated happiness –</line>
      <line> So frequently repeated – and by force</line>
      <line>Of obscure feelings representative</line>
      <line>Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,</line>
      <line>So beauteous and majestic in themselves,</line>
      <line>Though yet the day was distant, did at length</line>
      <line>Become habitually dear, and all</line>
      <line>Their hues and forms were by invisible links</line>
      <line>Allied to the affections.</line>
      <line>I began</line>
      <line>My story early, feeling, as I fear,</line>
      <line>The weakness of a human love for days</line>
      <line> Disowned by memory – ere the birth of spring</line>
      <line>Planting my snowdrops among winter snows.</line>
      <line>Nor will it seem to thee, my friend, so prompt</line>
      <line>In sympathy, that I have lengthened out</line>
      <line>With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile my hope has been that I might fetch</line>
      <line>Reproaches from my former years, whose power</line>
      <line>May spur me on, in manhood now mature,</line>
      <line>To honourable toil. Yet should it be</line>
      <line>That this is but an impotent desire –</line>
      <line> That I by such inquiry am not taught</line>
      <line>To understand myself, nor thou to know</line>
      <line>With better knowledge how the heart was framed</line>
      <line>Of him thou lovest – need I dread from thee</line>
      <line>Harsh judgements if I am so loath to quit</line>
      <line>Those recollected hours that have the charm</line>
      <line>Of visionary things, and lovely forms</line>
      <line>And sweet sensations, that throw back our life</line>
      <line>And make our infancy a visible scene</line>
      <line>On which the sun is shining?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus far, my friend, have we retraced the way</line>
      <line>Through which I travelled when I first began</line>
      <line>To love the woods and fields. The passion yet</line>
      <line>Was in its birth, sustained, as might befall,</line>
      <line> By nourishment that came unsought – for still</line>
      <line>From week to week, from month to month, we lived</line>
      <line>A round of tumult. Duly were our games</line>
      <line>Prolonged in summer till the daylight failed:</line>
      <line>No chair remained before the doors, the bench</line>
      <line>And threshold-steps were empty, fast asleep</line>
      <line>The labourer and the old man who had sat</line>
      <line>A later lingerer, yet the revelry</line>
      <line>Continued and the loud uproar. At last,</line>
      <line>When all the ground was dark and the huge clouds</line>
      <line> Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went</line>
      <line>With weary joints and with a beating mind.</line>
      <line>Ah, is there one, who ever has been young</line>
      <line>And needs a monitory voice to tame</line>
      <line>The pride of virtue and of intellect?</line>
      <line>And is there one, the wisest and the best</line>
      <line>Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish</line>
      <line>For things which cannot be, who would not give,</line>
      <line>If so he might, to duty and to truth</line>
      <line>The eagerness of infantine desire?</line>
      <line> A tranquillizing spirit presses now</line>
      <line>On my corporeal frame, so wide appears</line>
      <line>The vacancy between me and those days,</line>
      <line>Which yet have such self-presence in my heart</line>
      <line>That sometimes when I think of them I seem</line>
      <line>Two consciousnesses – conscious of myself,</line>
      <line>And of some other being.</line>
      <line>A grey stone</line>
      <line>Of native rock, left midway in the square</line>
      <line>Of our small market-village, was the home</line>
      <line>And centre of these joys; and when, returned</line>
      <line> After long absence, thither I repaired,</line>
      <line>I found that it was split and gone to build</line>
      <line>A smart assembly-room that perked and flared</line>
      <line>With wash and rough-cast, elbowing the ground</line>
      <line>Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,</line>
      <line>And be ye happy! Yet I know, my friends,</line>
      <line>That more than one of you will think with me</line>
      <line>Of those soft starry nights, and that old dame</line>
      <line>From whom the stone was named, who there had sat</line>
      <line>And watched her table with its huckster’s wares,</line>
      <line> Assiduous, for the length of sixty years.</line>
      <line>We ran a boisterous race, the year spun round</line>
      <line>With giddy motion; but the time approached</line>
      <line>That brought with it a regular desire</line>
      <line>For calmer pleasures – when the beauteous scenes</line>
      <line>Of Nature were collaterally attached</line>
      <line>To every scheme of holiday delight,</line>
      <line>And every boyish sport, less grateful else</line>
      <line>And languidly pursued. When summer came</line>
      <line>It was the pastime of our afternoons</line>
      <line> To beat along the plain of Windermere</line>
      <line>With rival oars; and the selected bourne</line>
      <line>Was now an island musical with birds</line>
      <line>That sang for ever, now a sister isle</line>
      <line>Beneath the oak’s umbrageous covert, sown</line>
      <line>With lilies-of-the-valley like a field,</line>
      <line>And now a third small island where remained</line>
      <line>An old stone table and one mouldered cave –</line>
      <line>A hermit’s history. In such a race,</line>
      <line>So ended, disappointment could be none,</line>
      <line> Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy;</line>
      <line>We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,</line>
      <line>Conquered or conqueror. Thus our selfishness</line>
      <line>Was mellowed down, and thus the pride of strength</line>
      <line>And the vainglory of superior skill</line>
      <line>Were interfused with objects which subdued</line>
      <line>And tempered them, and gradually produced</line>
      <line>A quiet independence of the heart.</line>
      <line>And to my friend who knows me I may add,</line>
      <line>Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence</line>
      <line> Ensued a diffidence and modesty,</line>
      <line>And I was taught to feel – perhaps too much –</line>
      <line>The self-sufficing power of solitude.</line>
      <line>No delicate viands sapped our bodily strength:</line>
      <line>More than we wished we knew the blessing then</line>
      <line>Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals</line>
      <line>Were frugal, Sabine fare – and then, exclude</line>
      <line>A little weekly stipend, and we lived</line>
      <line>Through three divisions of the quartered year</line>
      <line>In penniless poverty. But now, to school</line>
      <line> Returned from the half-yearly holidays,</line>
      <line>We came with purses more profusely filled,</line>
      <line>Allowance which abundantly sufficed</line>
      <line>To gratify the palate with repasts</line>
      <line>More costly than the dame of whom I spake,</line>
      <line>That ancient woman, and her board, supplied.</line>
      <line>Hence inroads into distant vales, and long</line>
      <line>Excursions far away among the hills,</line>
      <line>Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground –</line>
      <line>Or in the woods, or by a river-side</line>
      <line> Or fountain – festive banquets, that provoked</line>
      <line>The languid action of a natural scene</line>
      <line>By pleasure of corporeal appetite.</line>
      <line>Nor is my aim neglected if I tell</line>
      <line>How twice in the long length of those half-years</line>
      <line>We from our funds perhaps with bolder hand</line>
      <line>Drew largely, anxious for one day at least</line>
      <line>To feel the motion of the galloping steed;</line>
      <line>And with the good old innkeeper, in truth,</line>
      <line>I needs must say that sometimes we have used</line>
      <line>Sly subterfuge, for the intended bound</line>
      <line>Of the day’s journey was too distant far</line>
      <line>For any cautious man: a structure famed</line>
      <line>Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique walls</line>
      <line>Of a large abbey, with its fractured arch,</line>
      <line>Belfry, and images, and living trees –</line>
      <line>A holy scene. Along the smooth green turf</line>
      <line>Our horses grazed. In more than inland peace,</line>
      <line>Left by the winds that overpass the vale,</line>
      <line>In that sequestered ruin trees and towers –</line>
      <line> Both silent and both motionless alike –</line>
      <line>Hear all day long the murmuring sea that beats</line>
      <line>Incessantly upon a craggy shore.</line>
      <line>Our steeds remounted, and the summons given,</line>
      <line>With whip and spur we by the chantry flew</line>
      <line>In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight</line>
      <line>And the stone abbot, and that single wren</line>
      <line>Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave</line>
      <line>Of the old church that, though from recent showers</line>
      <line>The earth was comfortless, and, touched by faint</line>
      <line> Internal breezes, from the roofless walls</line>
      <line>The shuddering ivy dripped large drops, yet still</line>
      <line>So sweetly mid the gloom the invisible bird</line>
      <line>Sang to itself that there I could have made</line>
      <line>My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there,</line>
      <line>To hear such music. Through the walls we flew</line>
      <line>And down the valley, and, a circuit made</line>
      <line>In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth</line>
      <line>We scampered homeward. Oh, ye rocks and streams,</line>
      <line>And that still spirit of the evening air,</line>
      <line> Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt</line>
      <line>Your presence, when, with slackened step, we breathed</line>
      <line>Along the sides of the steep hills, or when,</line>
      <line>Lightened by gleams of moonlight from the sea,</line>
      <line>We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.</line>
      <line>There was a row of ancient trees, since fallen,</line>
      <line>That on the margin of a jutting land</line>
      <line>Stood near the lake of Coniston, and made,</line>
      <line>With its long boughs above the water stretched,</line>
      <line>A gloom through which a boat might sail along</line>
      <line> As in a cloister. An old hall was near,</line>
      <line>Grotesque and beautiful, its gavel-end</line>
      <line>And huge round chimneys to the top o’ergrown</line>
      <line>With fields of ivy. Thither we repaired –</line>
      <line>’Twas even a custom with us – to the shore,</line>
      <line>And to that cool piazza. They who dwelt</line>
      <line>In the neglected mansion-house supplied</line>
      <line>Fresh butter, tea-kettle and earthenware,</line>
      <line>And chafing-dish with smoking coals; and so</line>
      <line>Beneath the trees we sat in our small boat,</line>
      <line> And in the covert ate our delicate meal</line>
      <line>Upon the calm smooth lake.</line>
      <line>It was a joy</line>
      <line>Worthy the heart of one who is full-grown</line>
      <line>To rest beneath those horizontal boughs</line>
      <line>And mark the radiance of the setting sun,</line>
      <line>Himself unseen, reposing on the top</line>
      <line>Of the high eastern hills. And there I said,</line>
      <line>That beauteous sight before me, there I said</line>
      <line>(Then first beginning in my thoughts to mark</line>
      <line>That sense of dim similitude which links</line>
      <line> Our moral feelings with external forms)</line>
      <line>That in whatever region I should close</line>
      <line>My mortal life I would remember you,</line>
      <line>Fair scenes – that dying I would think on you,</line>
      <line>My soul would send a longing look to you,</line>
      <line>Even as that setting sun, while all the vale</line>
      <line>Could nowhere catch one faint memorial gleam,</line>
      <line>Yet with the last remains of his last light</line>
      <line>Still lingered, and a farewell lustre threw</line>
      <line>On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.</line>
      <line> ’Twas then my fourteenth summer, and these words</line>
      <line>Were uttered in a casual access</line>
      <line>Of sentiment, a momentary trance</line>
      <line>That far outran the habit of my mind.</line>
      <line>Upon the eastern shore of Windermere</line>
      <line>Above the crescent of a pleasant bay</line>
      <line>There was an inn, no homely-featured shed,</line>
      <line>Brother of the surrounding cottages,</line>
      <line>But ’twas a splendid place, the door beset</line>
      <line>With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within</line>
      <line> Decanters, glasses and the blood-red wine.</line>
      <line>In ancient times, or ere the hall was built</line>
      <line>On the large island, had the dwelling been</line>
      <line>More worthy of a poet’s love, a hut</line>
      <line>Proud of its one bright fire and sycamore shade;</line>
      <line>But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed</line>
      <line>The threshold, and large golden characters</line>
      <line>On the blue-frosted signboard had usurped</line>
      <line>The place of the old lion, in contempt</line>
      <line>And mockery of the rustic painter’s hand,</line>
      <line> Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear</line>
      <line>With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay</line>
      <line>Upon a slope surmounted by the plain</line>
      <line>Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood</line>
      <line>A grove, with gleams of water through the trees</line>
      <line>And over the tree-tops – nor did we want</line>
      <line>Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream –</line>
      <line>And there through half an afternoon we played</line>
      <line>On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent</line>
      <line>Made all the mountains ring.</line>
      <line>But ere the fall</line>
      <line>Of night, when in our pinnace we returned</line>
      <line>Over the dusky lake, and to the beach</line>
      <line>Of some small island steered our course, with one,</line>
      <line>The minstrel of our troop, and left him there,</line>
      <line>And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute</line>
      <line>Alone upon the rock, oh, then the calm</line>
      <line>And dead still water lay upon my mind</line>
      <line>Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,</line>
      <line>Never before so beautiful, sank down</line>
      <line>Into my heart and held me like a dream.</line>
      <line> Thus day by day my sympathies increased,</line>
      <line>And thus the common range of visible things</line>
      <line>Grew dear to me. Already I began</line>
      <line>To love the sun – a boy I loved the sun</line>
      <line>Not as I since have loved him (as a pledge</line>
      <line>And surety of my earthly life, a light</line>
      <line>Which while I view I feel I am alive),</line>
      <line>But for this cause, that I had seen him lay</line>
      <line>His beauty on the morning hills, had seen</line>
      <line>The western mountain touch his setting orb</line>
      <line> In many a thoughtless hour, when from excess</line>
      <line>Of happiness my blood appeared to flow</line>
      <line>With its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.</line>
      <line>And from like feelings, humble though intense,</line>
      <line>To patriotic and domestic love</line>
      <line>Analogous, the moon to me was dear:</line>
      <line>For I would dream away my purposes</line>
      <line>Standing to look upon her, while she hung</line>
      <line>Midway between the hills as if she knew</line>
      <line>No other region but belonged to thee,</line>
      <line> Yea appertained by a peculiar right</line>
      <line>To thee and thy grey huts, my native vale.</line>
      <line>Those incidental charms which first attached</line>
      <line>My heart to rural objects, day by day</line>
      <line>Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell</line>
      <line>How Nature, intervenient till this time</line>
      <line>And secondary, now at length was sought</line>
      <line>For her own sake. But who shall parcel out</line>
      <line>His intellect by geometric rules</line>
      <line>Split like a province into round and square?</line>
      <line> Who knows the individual hour in which</line>
      <line>His habits were first sown even as a seed?</line>
      <line>Who that shall point as with a wand, and say</line>
      <line>‘This portion of the river of my mind</line>
      <line>Came from yon fountain’? Thou, my friend, art one</line>
      <line>More deeply read in thy own thoughts, no slave</line>
      <line>Of that false secondary power by which</line>
      <line>In weakness we create distinctions, then</line>
      <line>Believe our puny boundaries are things</line>
      <line>Which we perceive, and not which we have made.</line>
      <line> To thee, unblinded by these outward shows,</line>
      <line>The unity of all has been revealed;</line>
      <line>And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skilled</line>
      <line>Than many are to class the cabinet</line>
      <line>Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase</line>
      <line>Run through the history and birth of each</line>
      <line>As of a single independent thing.</line>
      <line>Hard task to analyze a soul, in which</line>
      <line>Not only general habits and desires,</line>
      <line>But each most obvious and particular thought –</line>
      <line> Not in a mystical and idle sense,</line>
      <line>But in the words of reason deeply weighed –</line>
      <line>Hath no beginning.</line>
      <line>Blest the infant babe –</line>
      <line>For with my best conjectures I would trace</line>
      <line>The progress of our being – blest the babe</line>
      <line>Nursed in his mother’s arms, the babe who sleeps</line>
      <line>Upon his mother’s breast, who, when his soul</line>
      <line>Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,</line>
      <line>Doth gather passion from his mother’s eye.</line>
      <line>Such feelings pass into his torpid life</line>
      <line> Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind,</line>
      <line>Even in the first trial of its powers,</line>
      <line>Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine</line>
      <line>In one appearance all the elements</line>
      <line>And parts of the same object, else detached</line>
      <line>And loath to coalesce. Thus day by day,</line>
      <line>Subjected to the discipline of love,</line>
      <line>His organs and recipient faculties</line>
      <line>Are quickened, are more vigorous; his mind spreads,</line>
      <line>Tenacious of the forms which it receives.</line>
      <line> In one belovéd presence – nay and more,</line>
      <line>In that most apprehensive habitude</line>
      <line>And those sensations which have been derived</line>
      <line>From this belovéd presence – there exists</line>
      <line>A virtue which irradiates and exalts</line>
      <line>All objects through all intercourse of sense.</line>
      <line>No outcast he, bewildered and depressed;</line>
      <line>Along his infant veins are interfused</line>
      <line>The gravitation and the filial bond</line>
      <line>Of Nature that connect him with the world.</line>
      <line> Emphatically such a being lives,</line>
      <line>An inmate of this active universe.</line>
      <line>From Nature largely he receives, nor so</line>
      <line>Is satisfied, but largely gives again;</line>
      <line>For feeling has to him imparted strength,</line>
      <line>And – powerful in all sentiments of grief,</line>
      <line>Of exultation, fear and joy – his mind,</line>
      <line>Even as an agent of the one great mind,</line>
      <line>Creates, creator and receiver both,</line>
      <line>Working but in alliance with the works</line>
      <line>Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the first</line>
      <line>Poetic spirit of our human life –</line>
      <line>By uniform control of after-years</line>
      <line>In most abated and suppressed, in some</line>
      <line>Through every change of growth or of decay</line>
      <line>Pre-eminent till death.</line>
      <line>From early days,</line>
      <line>Beginning not long after that first time</line>
      <line>In which, a babe, by intercourse of touch</line>
      <line>I held mute dialogues with my mother’s heart,</line>
      <line>I have endeavoured to display the means</line>
      <line> Whereby this infant sensibility,</line>
      <line>Great birthright of our being, was in me</line>
      <line>Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path</line>
      <line>More difficult before me, and I fear</line>
      <line>That in its broken windings we shall need</line>
      <line>The chamois’ sinews and the eagle’s wing.</line>
      <line>For now a trouble came into my mind</line>
      <line>From obscure causes. I was left alone</line>
      <line>Seeking this visible world, nor knowing why:</line>
      <line>The props of my affections were removed,</line>
      <line> And yet the building stood, as if sustained</line>
      <line>By its own spirit. All that I beheld</line>
      <line>Was dear to me, and from this cause it came</line>
      <line>That now to Nature’s finer influxes</line>
      <line>My mind lay open – to that more exact</line>
      <line>And intimate communion which our hearts</line>
      <line>Maintain with the minuter properties</line>
      <line>Of objects which already are beloved,</line>
      <line>And of those only.</line>
      <line>Many are the joys</line>
      <line>Of youth, but oh, what happiness to live</line>
      <line> When every hour brings palpable access</line>
      <line>Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,</line>
      <line>And sorrow is not there. The seasons came,</line>
      <line>And every season brought a countless store</line>
      <line>Of modes and temporary qualities</line>
      <line>Which but for this most watchful power of love</line>
      <line>Had been neglected – left a register</line>
      <line>Of permanent relations, else unknown.</line>
      <line>Hence life and change and beauty, solitude</line>
      <line>More active even than ‘best society’,</line>
      <line> Society made sweet as solitude</line>
      <line>By silent inobtrusive sympathies,</line>
      <line>And gentle agitations of the mind</line>
      <line>From manifold distinctions (difference</line>
      <line>Perceived in things where to the common eye</line>
      <line>No difference is) – and hence, from the same source,</line>
      <line>Sublimer joy.</line>
      <line>For I would walk alone</line>
      <line>In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights</line>
      <line>Beneath the quiet heavens, and at that time</line>
      <line>Would feel whate’er there is of power in sound</line>
      <line> To breathe an elevated mood, by form</line>
      <line>Or image unprofaned; and I would stand</line>
      <line>Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are</line>
      <line>The ghostly language of the ancient earth,</line>
      <line>Or make their dim abode in distant winds.</line>
      <line>Thence did I drink the visionary power.</line>
      <line>I deem not profitless these fleeting moods</line>
      <line>Of shadowy exaltation; not for this,</line>
      <line>That they are kindred to our purer mind</line>
      <line>And intellectual life, but that the soul –</line>
      <line> Remembering how she felt, but what she felt</line>
      <line>Remembering not – retains an obscure sense</line>
      <line>Of possible sublimity, to which</line>
      <line>With growing faculties she doth aspire,</line>
      <line>With faculties still growing, feeling still</line>
      <line>That whatsoever point they gain they still</line>
      <line>Have something to pursue.</line>
      <line>And not alone</line>
      <line>In grandeur and in tumult, but no less</line>
      <line>In tranquil scenes, that universal power</line>
      <line>And fitness in the latent qualities</line>
      <line> And essences of things, by which the mind</line>
      <line>Is moved with feelings of delight, to me</line>
      <line>Came strengthened with a superadded soul,</line>
      <line>A virtue not its own. My morning walks</line>
      <line>Were early: oft before the hours of school</line>
      <line>I travelled round our little lake, five miles</line>
      <line>Of pleasant wandering – happy time, more dear</line>
      <line>For this, that one was by my side, a friend</line>
      <line>Then passionately loved. With heart how full</line>
      <line>Will he peruse these lines, this page (perhaps</line>
      <line> A blank to other men); for many years</line>
      <line>Have since flowed in between us, and, our minds</line>
      <line>Both silent to each other, at this time</line>
      <line>We live as if those hours had never been.</line>
      <line>Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch</line>
      <line>Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush</line>
      <line>Was audible, among the hills I sat</line>
      <line>Alone upon some jutting eminence</line>
      <line>At the first hour of morning, when the vale</line>
      <line>Lay quiet in an utter solitude.</line>
      <line> How shall I trace the history, where seek</line>
      <line>The origin of what I then have felt?</line>
      <line>Oft in those moments such a holy calm</line>
      <line>Did overspread my soul that I forgot</line>
      <line>The agency of sight, and what I saw</line>
      <line>Appeared like something in myself, a dream,</line>
      <line>A prospect in my mind.</line>
      <line>’Twere long to tell</line>
      <line>What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,</line>
      <line>And what the summer shade, what day and night,</line>
      <line>The evening and the morning, what my dreams</line>
      <line>And what my waking thoughts, supplied to nurse</line>
      <line>That spirit of religious love in which</line>
      <line>I walked with Nature. But let this at least</line>
      <line>Be not forgotten, that I still retained</line>
      <line>My first creative sensibility,</line>
      <line>That by the regular action of the world</line>
      <line>My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power</line>
      <line>Abode with me, a forming hand, at times</line>
      <line>Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,</line>
      <line>A local spirit of its own, at war</line>
      <line> With general tendency, but for the most</line>
      <line>Subservient strictly to the external things</line>
      <line>With which it communed. An auxiliar light</line>
      <line>Came from my mind, which on the setting sun</line>
      <line>Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,</line>
      <line>The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on</line>
      <line>Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyed</line>
      <line>A like dominion, and the midnight storm</line>
      <line>Grew darker in the presence of my eye.</line>
      <line>Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,</line>
      <line>And hence my transport.</line>
      <line> Nor should this, perchance,</line>
      <line>Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved</line>
      <line>The exercise and produce of a toil</line>
      <line>Than analytic industry to me</line>
      <line>More pleasing, and whose character I deem</line>
      <line>Is more poetic, as resembling more</line>
      <line>Creative agency – I mean to speak</line>
      <line>Of that interminable building reared</line>
      <line>By observation of affinities</line>
      <line>In objects where no brotherhood exists</line>
      <line> To common minds. My seventeenth year was come,</line>
      <line>And, whether (from this habit rooted now</line>
      <line>So deeply in my mind, or from excess</line>
      <line>Of the great social principle of life</line>
      <line>Coercing all things into sympathy)</line>
      <line>To unorganic natures I transferred</line>
      <line>My own enjoyments, or (the power of truth</line>
      <line>Coming in revelation) I conversed</line>
      <line>With things that really are, I at this time</line>
      <line>Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.</line>
      <line> Thus did my days pass on, and now at length</line>
      <line>From Nature and her overflowing soul</line>
      <line>I had received so much that all my thoughts</line>
      <line>Were steeped in feeling.</line>
      <line>I was only then</line>
      <line>Contented when with bliss ineffable</line>
      <line>I felt the sentiment of being, spread</line>
      <line>O’er all that moves and all that seemeth still,</line>
      <line>O’er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought</line>
      <line>And human knowledge, to the human eye</line>
      <line>Invisible, yet liveth to the heart,</line>
      <line> O’er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,</line>
      <line>Or beats the gladsome air, o’er all that glides</line>
      <line>Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself</line>
      <line>And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not</line>
      <line>If such my transports were, for in all things</line>
      <line>I saw one life, and felt that it was joy;</line>
      <line>One song they sang and it was audible –</line>
      <line>Most audible then when the fleshly ear,</line>
      <line>O’ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,</line>
      <line>Forgot its functions and slept undisturbed.</line>
      <line> If this be error, and another faith</line>
      <line>Find easier access to the pious mind,</line>
      <line>Yet were I grossly destitute of all</line>
      <line>Those human sentiments which make this earth</line>
      <line>So dear if I should fail with grateful voice</line>
      <line>To speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakes</line>
      <line>And sounding cataracts, ye mists and winds</line>
      <line>That dwell among the hills where I was born.</line>
      <line>If in my youth I have been pure in heart,</line>
      <line>If, mingling with the world, I am content</line>
      <line> With my own modest pleasures, and have lived</line>
      <line>With God and Nature communing, removed</line>
      <line>From little enmities and low desires,</line>
      <line>The gift is yours! If, in these times of fear,</line>
      <line>This melancholy waste of hopes overthrown,</line>
      <line>If, mid indifference and apathy</line>
      <line>And wicked exultation, when good men</line>
      <line>On every side fall off we know not how</line>
      <line>To selfishness (disguised in gentle names</line>
      <line>Of peace and quiet and domestic love,</line>
      <line> Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers</line>
      <line>On visionary minds) – if, in this time</line>
      <line>Of dereliction and dismay, I yet</line>
      <line>Despair not of our nature, but retain</line>
      <line>A more than Roman confidence, a faith</line>
      <line>That fails not, in all sorrow my support,</line>
      <line>The blessing of my life, the gift is yours</line>
      <line>Ye mountains, thine oh Nature! Thou hast fed</line>
      <line>My lofty speculations, and in thee,</line>
      <line>For this uneasy heart of ours, I find</line>
      <line> A never-failing principle of joy</line>
      <line>And purest passion.</line>
      <line>Thou, my friend, wast reared</line>
      <line>In the great city, mid far other scenes,</line>
      <line>But we by different roads at length have gained</line>
      <line>The self-same bourne. And from this cause to thee</line>
      <line>I speak unapprehensive of contempt,</line>
      <line>The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,</line>
      <line>And all that silent language which so oft</line>
      <line>In conversation betwixt man and man</line>
      <line>Blots from the human countenance all trace</line>
      <line>Of beauty and of love. For thou hast sought</line>
      <line>The truth in solitude, and thou art one</line>
      <line>The most intense of Nature’s worshippers,</line>
      <line>In many things my brother, chiefly here</line>
      <line>In this my deep devotion.</line>
      <line>Fare thee well!</line>
      <line>Health and the quiet of a healthful mind</line>
      <line>Attend thee, seeking oft the haunts of men –</line>
      <line>But yet more often living with thyself,</line>
      <line>And for thyself – so haply shall thy days</line>
      <line>Be many, and a blessing to mankind.</line>

    <title>Statue Horse</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>One evening, walking in the public way,</line>
      <line>A peasant of the valley where I dwelt</line>
      <line>Being my chance companion, he stopped short</line>
      <line>And pointed to an object full in view</line>
      <line> At a small distance. ’Twas a horse, that stood</line>
      <line>Alone upon a little breast of ground</line>
      <line>With a clear silver moonlight sky behind.</line>
      <line>With one leg from the ground the creature stood,</line>
      <line>Insensible and still: breath, motion, gone –</line>
      <line>Hairs, colour, all but shape and substance, gone –</line>
      <line>Mane, ears, and tail, as lifeless as the trunk</line>
      <line>That had no stir of breath! We paused awhile</line>
      <line>In pleasure of the sight, and left him there,</line>
      <line>With all his functions silently sealed up,</line>
      <line> Like an amphibious work of Nature’s hand,</line>
      <line>A borderer dwelling betwixt life and death,</line>
      <line>A living statue or a statued life.</line>

    <title>Climbing of Snowdon (Prelude XIII)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was a summer’s night, a close warm night,</line>
      <line>Wan, dull and glaring, with a dripping mist</line>
      <line>Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky</line>
      <line>Half threatening storm and rain; but on we went</line>
      <line>Unchecked, being full of heart and having faith</line>
      <line> In our tried pilot. Little could we see</line>
      <line>Hemmed round on every side with fog and damp,</line>
      <line>And, after ordinary travellers’ chat</line>
      <line>With our conductor, silently we sank</line>
      <line>Each into commerce with his private thoughts.</line>
      <line>Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself</line>
      <line>Was nothing either seen or heard the while</line>
      <line>Which took me from my musings, save that once</line>
      <line>The shepherd’s cur did to his own great joy</line>
      <line>Unearth a hedgehog in the mountain crags</line>
      <line> Round which he made a barking turbulent.</line>
      <line>This small adventure (for even such it seemed</line>
      <line>In that wild place and at the dead of night)</line>
      <line>Being over and forgotten, on we wound</line>
      <line>In silence as before.</line>
      <line>With forehead bent</line>
      <line>Earthward, as if in opposition set</line>
      <line>Against an enemy, I panted up</line>
      <line>With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.</line>
      <line>Thus might we wear perhaps an hour away,</line>
      <line>Ascending at loose distance each from each,</line>
      <line> And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band –</line>
      <line>When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,</line>
      <line>And with a step or two seemed brighter still;</line>
      <line>Nor had I time to ask the cause of this,</line>
      <line>For instantly a light upon the turf</line>
      <line>Fell like a flash! I looked about, and lo,</line>
      <line>The moon stood naked in the heavens at height</line>
      <line>Immense above my head, and on the shore</line>
      <line>I found myself of a huge sea of mist,</line>
      <line>Which meek and silent rested at my feet.</line>
      <line> A hundred hills their dusky backs upheaved</line>
      <line>All over this still ocean; and beyond,</line>
      <line>Far, far beyond, the vapours shot themselves</line>
      <line>In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,</line>
      <line>Into the sea – the real sea, that seemed</line>
      <line>To dwindle and give up its majesty,</line>
      <line>Usurped upon as far as sight could reach.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile, the moon looked down upon this show</line>
      <line>In single glory, and we stood, the mist</line>
      <line>Touching our very feet.</line>
      <line>And from the shore</line>
      <line> At distance not the third part of a mile</line>
      <line>Was a blue chasm, a fracture in the vapour,</line>
      <line>A deep and gloomy breathing-place through which</line>
      <line>Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streams</line>
      <line>Innumerable, roaring with one voice!</line>
      <line>The universal spectacle throughout</line>
      <line>Was shaped for admiration and delight,</line>
      <line>Grand in itself alone, but in that breach</line>
      <line>Through which the homeless voice of waters rose,</line>
      <line>That dark deep thoroughfare, had Nature lodged</line>
      <line> The soul, the imagination of the whole.</line>
      <line>A meditation rose in me that night</line>
      <line>Upon the lonely mountain when the scene</line>
      <line>Had passed away, and it appeared to me</line>
      <line>The perfect image of a mighty mind,</line>
      <line>Of one that feeds upon infinity,</line>
      <line>That is exalted by an underpresence,</line>
      <line>The sense of God, or whatso’er is dim</line>
      <line>Or vast in its own being.</line>

    <title>Crossing the Alps (Prelude VI)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upturning with a band</line>
      <line> Of travellers, from the Valais we had clomb</line>
      <line>Along the road that leads to Italy;</line>
      <line>A length of hours, making of these our guides</line>
      <line>Did we advance, and having reached an inn</line>
      <line>Among the mountains, we together ate</line>
      <line>Our noon’s repast, from which the travellers rose</line>
      <line>Leaving us at the board. Erelong we followed,</line>
      <line>Descending by the beaten road that led</line>
      <line>Right to a rivulet’s edge, and there broke off.</line>
      <line>The only track now visible was one</line>
      <line>Upon the further side, right opposite,</line>
      <line>And up a lofty mountain. This we took</line>
      <line>After a little scruple, and short pause,</line>
      <line>And climbed with eagerness, though not at length</line>
      <line>Without surprise and some anxiety</line>
      <line>On finding that we did not overtake</line>
      <line>Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,</line>
      <line>While every moment now increased our doubts,</line>
      <line>A peasant met us, and from him we learned</line>
      <line>That to the place which had perplexed us first</line>
      <line> We must descend, and there should find the road,</line>
      <line>Which in the stony channel of the stream</line>
      <line>Lay a few steps, and then along its banks –</line>
      <line>And further, that thenceforward all our course</line>
      <line>Was downwards with the current of that stream.</line>
      <line>Hard of belief, we questioned him again,</line>
      <line>And all the answers which the man returned</line>
      <line>To our inquiries – in their sense and substance,</line>
      <line>Translated by the feelings which we had –</line>
      <line>Ended in this, that we had crossed the Alps!</line>
      <line> Imagination – lifting up itself</line>
      <line>Before the eye and progress of my song</line>
      <line>Like an unfathered vapour, here that power,</line>
      <line>In all the might of its endowments, came</line>
      <line>Athwart me! I was lost as in a cloud,</line>
      <line>Halted without a struggle to break through;</line>
      <line>And now, recovering, to my soul I say</line>
      <line>‘I recognize thy glory.’ In such strength</line>
      <line>Of usurpation, in such visitings</line>
      <line>Of awful promise, when the light of sense</line>
      <line> Goes out in flashes that have shown to us</line>
      <line>The invisible world, does greatness make abode –</line>
      <line>There harbours whether we be young or old.</line>
      <line>Our destiny, our nature, and our home,</line>
      <line>Is with infinitude, and only there –</line>
      <line>With hope it is, hope that can never die,</line>
      <line>Effort, and expectation, and desire,</line>
      <line>And something evermore about to be.</line>
      <line>The mind beneath such banners militant</line>
      <line>Thinks not of spoils or trophies, nor of aught</line>
      <line> That may attest its prowess, blest in thoughts</line>
      <line>That are their own perfection and reward –</line>
      <line>Strong in itself, and in the access of joy</line>
      <line>Which hides it like the overflowing Nile.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The dull and heavy slackening which ensued</line>
      <line>Upon those tidings by the peasant given</line>
      <line>Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,</line>
      <line>And entered with the road which we had missed</line>
      <line>Into a narrow chasm. The brook and road</line>
      <line>Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy pass,</line>
      <line> And with them did we journey several hours</line>
      <line>At a slow step. The immeasurable height</line>
      <line>Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,</line>
      <line>The stationary blasts of waterfalls,</line>
      <line>And everywhere along the hollow rent</line>
      <line>Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,</line>
      <line>The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,</line>
      <line>The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,</line>
      <line>Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside</line>
      <line>As if a voice were in them, the sick sight</line>
      <line> And giddy prospect of the raving stream,</line>
      <line>The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens,</line>
      <line>Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light –</line>
      <line>Were all like workings of one mind, the features</line>
      <line>Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree,</line>
      <line>Characters of the great apocalypse,</line>
      <line>The types and symbols of eternity,</line>
      <line>Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Call the strange spirit that abides unseen</line>
      <line>In wilds and wastes and shaggy solitudes,</line>
      <line>And bid his dim hand lead thee through these scenes</line>
      <line>That burst immense around – by mountains, glens,</line>
      <line> And solitary cataracts that dash</line>
      <line>Through dark ravines, and trees whose wreathéd roots</line>
      <line>O’erhang the torrent’s channelled course, and streams</line>
      <line>That far below, along the narrow vale,</line>
      <line>Upon their rocky way wind musical!</line>
      <line>Stranger, if Nature charm thee – if thou lovest</line>
      <line>To trace her awful steps, in glade or glen,</line>
      <line>Or under covert of the rocking wood</line>
      <line>That sways its murmuring and mossy boughs</line>
      <line>Above thy head – now, when the wind at times</line>
      <line> Stirs its deep silence round thee, and the shower</line>
      <line>Falls on the sighing foliage, hail her here</line>
      <line>In these her haunts, and, wrapt in musings high,</line>
      <line>Think that thou holdest converse with some power</line>
      <line>Invisible and strange…</line>
      <line>Here Melancholy, on the pale crags laid,</line>
      <line>Might muse herself to sleep; or Fancy come,</line>
      <line>Witching the mind with tender cozenage,</line>
      <line>And shaping things that are not – here all day</line>
      <line>Might Meditation listen to the lapse</line>
      <line>Of the white waters flashing through the cleft,</line>
      <line>And, gazing on the many shadowing trees,</line>
      <line>Mingle a pensive moral as she gazed.</line>
      <line>High o’er thy head, amidst the shivered slate,</line>
      <line> Behold (a sapling yet) the wild ash bend,</line>
      <line>Its dark red berries clustering, as if it wished</line>
      <line>In the clear liquid mirror, ere it fell,</line>
      <line>To trace its beauties. O’er the prone cascade,</line>
      <line>Airy, and light, and elegant, the birch</line>
      <line>Displays its glossy stem amidst the gloom</line>
      <line>Of alders and jagg’d fern, as she wooed</line>
      <line>The passing gale to whisper flatteries!</line>
      <line>Upon the adverse bank, withered, and stripped</line>
      <line>Of all its pleasant leaves, a scathéd oak</line>
      <line>Hangs desolate…</line>
      <line>Now wind we up the glen, and hear below</line>
      <line>The dashing torrent, in deep woods concealed –</line>
      <line>And now, again, white water flashing on the view</line>
      <line>O’er the huge craggy fragments! Ancient stream,</line>
      <line>That murmurest through the mountain-solitudes,</line>
      <line>The time has been when no eye marked thy course</line>
      <line>Save his who made the world. Fancy might dream</line>
      <line>She saw thee thus bound on from age to age</line>
      <line>Unseen of man, whilst awful Nature sat</line>
      <line> On the rent rocks, and said: ‘These haunts be mine!’</line>
      <line>Now Taste has marked thy features, here and there</line>
      <line>Touching with tender hand, but injuring not,</line>
      <line>Thy beauties – whilst along thy woody verge</line>
      <line>Ascends the winding pathway, and the eye</line>
      <line>Catches at intervals thy varied falls.</line>

    <title>From Beachy Head</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>An early worshipper at Nature’s shrine,</line>
      <line>I loved her rudest scenes – warrens, and heaths,</line>
      <line>And yellow commons, and birch-shaded hollows,</line>
      <line>And hedgerows bordering unfrequented lanes,</line>
      <line>Bowered with wild roses and the clasping woodbine,</line>
      <line>Where purple tassels of the tangling vetch</line>
      <line>With bittersweet and bryony inweave,</line>
      <line>And the dew fills the silver bindweed’s cups.</line>
      <line>I loved to trace the brooks whose humid banks</line>
      <line> Nourish the harebell and the freckled pagil,</line>
      <line>And stroll among o’ershadowing woods of beech,</line>
      <line>Lending in summer from the heats of noon</line>
      <line>A whispering shade; while haply there reclines</line>
      <line>Some pensive lover of uncultured flowers</line>
      <line>Who, from the tumps with bright green mosses clad,</line>
      <line>Plucks the wood-sorrel with its light thin leaves,</line>
      <line>Heart-shaped and triply-folded, and its root</line>
      <line>Creeping like beaded coral – or who there</line>
      <line>Gathers (the copse’s pride) anemones,</line>
      <line> With rays like golden studs on ivory laid</line>
      <line>Most delicate, but touched with purple clouds,</line>
      <line>Fit crown for April’s fair but changeful brow.</line>
      <line>Ah, hills so early loved! In fancy still</line>
      <line>I breathe your pure keen air and still behold</line>
      <line>Those widely spreading views, mocking alike</line>
      <line>The poet and the painter’s utmost art –</line>
      <line>And still (observing objects more minute)</line>
      <line>Wondering remark the strange and foreign forms</line>
      <line>Of seashells, with the pale calcareous soil</line>
      <line> Mingled, and seeming of resembling substance –</line>
      <line>Though surely the blue ocean (from the heights</line>
      <line>Where the downs westward tend, but dimly seen)</line>
      <line>Here never rolled its surge? Does Nature then</line>
      <line>Mimic, in wanton mood, fantastic shapes</line>
      <line>Of bivalves, and inwreathed volutes, that cling</line>
      <line>To the dark sea-rock of the watery world?</line>
      <line>Or did this range of chalky mountains once</line>
      <line>Form a vast basin, where the ocean-waves</line>
      <line>Swelled fathomless, what time these fossil shells,</line>
      <line> Buoyed on their native element, were thrown</line>
      <line>Among the imbedding calx when the huge hill</line>
      <line>Its giant bulk heaved, and in strange ferment</line>
      <line>Grew up a guardian-barrier ’twixt the sea</line>
      <line>And the green level of the sylvan weald?</line>
      <line>Ah, very vain is Science’ proudest boast,</line>
      <line>And but a little light its flame yet lends</line>
      <line>To its most ardent votaries; since from whence</line>
      <line>These fossil forms are seen is but conjecture,</line>
      <line>Food for vague theories, or vain dispute –</line>
      <line> While to his daily task the peasant goes</line>
      <line>Unheeding such inquiry, with no care</line>
      <line>But that kindly change of sun and shower</line>
      <line>Fit for his toil the earth he cultivates.</line>
      <line>As little recks the herdsman of the hill</line>
      <line>(Who on some turfy knoll, idly reclined,</line>
      <line>Watches his wether-flock) that deep beneath</line>
      <line>Rest the remains of men of whom is left</line>
      <line>No traces in the records of mankind,</line>
      <line>Save what these half-obliterated mounds</line>
      <line>And half-filled trenches doubtfully impart…</line>
      <line>Near where a richer tract of cultured land</line>
      <line>Slopes to the south, and (burnished by the sun)</line>
      <line>Bend in the gale of August floods of corn;</line>
      <line>The guardian of the flock, with watchful care,</line>
      <line>Repels by voice and dog the encroaching sheep –</line>
      <line>While his boy visits every wiréd trap</line>
      <line>That scars the turf; and from the pit-falls takes</line>
      <line>The timid migrants, who, from distant wilds,</line>
      <line>Warrens and stone-quarries, are destined thus</line>
      <line> To lose their short existence. But unsought</line>
      <line>By Luxury yet, the shepherd still protects</line>
      <line>The social bird, who from his native haunts</line>
      <line>Of willowy current, or the rushy pool,</line>
      <line>Follows the fleecy crowd, and flirts and skims,</line>
      <line>In fellowship among them.</line>
      <line>Where the knoll</line>
      <line>More elevated takes the changeful winds,</line>
      <line>The windmill rears its vanes; and thitherward</line>
      <line>With his white load, the master travelling</line>
      <line>Scares the rooks rising slow on whispering wings,</line>
      <line> While o’er his head (before the summer sun</line>
      <line>Lights up the blue expanse), heard more than seen,</line>
      <line>The lark sings matins, and, above the clouds</line>
      <line>Floating, embathes his spotted breast in dew.</line>
      <line>Beneath the shadow of a gnarléd thorn</line>
      <line>Bent by the sea blast, from a seat of turf</line>
      <line>With fairy nosegays strewn, how wide the view!</line>
      <line>Till in the distant north it melts away</line>
      <line>And mingles indiscriminate with clouds –</line>
      <line>But if the eye could reach so far, the mart</line>
      <line> Of England’s capital, its domes and spires,</line>
      <line>Might be perceived! Yet hence the distant range</line>
      <line>Of Kentish hills appear in purple haze,</line>
      <line>And nearer, undulate the wooded heights</line>
      <line>And airy summits that above the mole</line>
      <line>Rise in green beauty, and the beaconed ridge</line>
      <line>Of Black Down shagged with heath, and, swelling rude</line>
      <line>Like a dark island from the vale, its brow</line>
      <line>Catching the last rays of the evening sun</line>
      <line>That gleam between the nearer park’s old oaks,</line>
      <line> Then lighten up the river, and make prominent</line>
      <line>The portal, and the ruined battlements</line>
      <line>Of that dismantled fortress, raised what time</line>
      <line>The Conqueror’s successors fiercely fought,</line>
      <line>Tearing with civil feuds the desolate land.</line>
      <line>But now a tiller of the soil dwells there,</line>
      <line>And of the turret’s looped and raftered halls</line>
      <line>Has made an humbler homestead – where he sees,</line>
      <line>Instead of arméd foemen, herds that graze</line>
      <line>Along his yellow meadows, or his flocks</line>
      <line>At evening from the upland driven to fold.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Come ye, whose hearts the tyrant sorrows wound,</line>
      <line>Come ye, whose breasts the tyrant passions tear,</line>
      <line>And seek this harp in whose still varying sound</line>
      <line>Each woe its own appropriate plaint may hear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Solemn and slow yon murmuring cadence rolls</line>
      <line>Till on the attentive ear it dies away,</line>
      <line>To your fond griefs responsive – ye whose souls,</line>
      <line>O’er loved lost friends, regret’s sad tribute pay!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But hark, in regular progression move</line>
      <line>Yon silver sounds, and mingle as they fall!</line>
      <line>Do they not wake thy trembling nerves, oh Love,</line>
      <line>And into warmer life thy feelings call?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Again it speaks, but, shrill and swift, the tones</line>
      <line>In wild disorder strike upon the ear!</line>
      <line> Pale Frenzy listens, kindred wildness owns,</line>
      <line>And starts – appalled the well-known sounds to hear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lo, e’en the gay, the giddy and the vain,</line>
      <line>In deep delight these vocal wires attend –</line>
      <line>Silent and breathless watch the varying strain</line>
      <line>And, pleased, the vacant toils of mirth suspend.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So when the lute on Memnon’s statue hung</line>
      <line>(At day’s first rising) strains melodious poured</line>
      <line>Untouched by mortal hands, the gathering throng</line>
      <line>In silent wonder listened and adored.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But the wild cadence of these trembling strings</line>
      <line>The enchantress Fancy with most rapture hears –</line>
      <line>At the sweet sound to grasp her wand she springs,</line>
      <line>And lo, her band of airy shapes appears!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She (rapt enthusiast) thinks the melting strains</line>
      <line>A choir of angels breathe, in bright array</line>
      <line>Bearing on radiant clouds to yon blue plains</line>
      <line>A soul just parted from its silent clay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And oft at eve her wild creative eye</line>
      <line>Sees to the gale their silken pinions stream,</line>
      <line> While in the quivering trees soft zephyrs sigh,</line>
      <line>And through the leaves disclose the moon’s pale beam.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, breathing instrument, be ever near</line>
      <line>While to the pensive muse my vows I pay;</line>
      <line>Thy softest call the inmost soul can hear,</line>
      <line>Thy faintest breath can Fancy’s pinions play.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when art’s laboured strains my feelings tire,</line>
      <line>To seek thy simple music shall be mine;</line>
      <line>I’ll strive to win its graces to my lyre,</line>
      <line>And make my plaintive lays enchant like thine!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>O’er Esthwaite’s lake, serene and still,</line>
      <line>At sunset’s silent peaceful hour</line>
      <line>Scarce moved the zephyr’s softest breath,</line>
      <line>Or sighed along its reedy shore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The lovely landscape on its sides,</line>
      <line>With evening’s softening hues impressed,</line>
      <line>Shared in the general calm, and gave</line>
      <line>Sweet visions of repose and rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Inverted on the waveless flood,</line>
      <line>A spotless mirror smooth and clear,</line>
      <line>Each fair surrounding object shone</line>
      <line>In softer beauty imaged there.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Brown hills and woods of various shades,</line>
      <line>Orchards and sloping meadows green,</line>
      <line> Sweet rural seats and sheltered farms,</line>
      <line>Were in the bright reflector seen.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>E’en lofty Tilberthwaite from far</line>
      <line>His giant shadow boldly threw,</line>
      <line>His ruggéd, dark, high-towering head</line>
      <line>On Esthwaite’s tranquil breast to view.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Struck with the beauty of the scene,</line>
      <line>I cried, ‘Oh may my yielding breast</line>
      <line>Retain but images of peace</line>
      <line>Like those, sweet lake, on thine impressed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Ne’er may it feel a ruder gale</line>
      <line>Than that which o’er thy surface spreads,</line>
      <line>When sportive zephyrs briskly play,</line>
      <line>And whisper through thy bordering reeds –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When, dancing in the solar beam,</line>
      <line>Thy silvery waves the margin seek</line>
      <line>With gently undulating flow,</line>
      <line>And there in softest murmurs break.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Vain wish – o’er Esthwaite’s tranquil lake</line>
      <line>A stronger gale full frequent blows,</line>
      <line> The soothing prospect disappears,</line>
      <line>The lovely visions of repose!</line>

    <title>Lake Leman (from Childe Harold III)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,</line>
      <line>The mirror where the stars and mountains view</line>
      <line>The stillness of their aspect in each trace</line>
      <line>Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue.</line>
      <line>There is too much of man here, to look through</line>
      <line>With a fit mind the might which I behold;</line>
      <line>But soon in me shall loneliness renew</line>
      <line>Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,</line>
      <line>Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind:</line>
      <line>All are not fit with them to stir and toil,</line>
      <line> Nor is it discontent to keep the mind</line>
      <line>Deep in its fountain, lest it over-boil</line>
      <line>In the hot throng, where we become the spoil</line>
      <line>Of our infection, till too late and long</line>
      <line>We may deplore and struggle with the coil,</line>
      <line>In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong</line>
      <line>Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There, in a moment, we may plunge our years</line>
      <line>In fatal penitence, and in the blight</line>
      <line>Of our own soul turn all our blood to tears,</line>
      <line> And colour things to come with hues of night!</line>
      <line>The race of life becomes a hopeless flight</line>
      <line>To those that walk in darkness – on the sea</line>
      <line>The boldest steer but where their ports invite –</line>
      <line>But there are wanderers o’er eternity</line>
      <line>Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne’er shall be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is it not better, then, to be alone,</line>
      <line>And love Earth only for its earthly sake –</line>
      <line>By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,</line>
      <line>Or the pure bosom of its nursing Lake</line>
      <line> Which feeds it as a mother who doth make</line>
      <line>A fair but froward infant her own care,</line>
      <line>Kissing its cries away as these awake –</line>
      <line>Is it not better thus our lives to wear,</line>
      <line>Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I live not in myself, but I become</line>
      <line>Portion of that around me, and to me</line>
      <line>High mountains are a feeling, but the hum</line>
      <line>Of human cities torture! I can see</line>
      <line>Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be</line>
      <line> A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,</line>
      <line>Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,</line>
      <line>And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain</line>
      <line>Of ocean, or the stars, mingle – and not in vain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:</line>
      <line>I look upon the peopled desert past,</line>
      <line>As on a place of agony and strife,</line>
      <line>Where, for some sin, to sorrow I was cast,</line>
      <line>To act and suffer, but remount at last</line>
      <line>With a fresh pinion – which I feel to spring,</line>
      <line> Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the blast</line>
      <line>Which it would cope with, on delighted wing</line>
      <line>Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when, at length, the mind shall be all free</line>
      <line>From what it hates in this degraded form,</line>
      <line>Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be</line>
      <line>Existent happier in the fly and worm –</line>
      <line>When elements to elements conform</line>
      <line>And dust is as it should be, shall I not</line>
      <line>Feel all I see less dazzling but more warm?</line>
      <line> The bodiless thought? The spirit of each spot,</line>
      <line>Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part</line>
      <line>Of me and of my soul, as I of them?</line>
      <line>Is not the love of these deep in my heart</line>
      <line>With a pure passion? Should I not contemn</line>
      <line>All objects, if compared with these – and stem</line>
      <line>A tide of suffering, rather than forego</line>
      <line>Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm</line>
      <line>Of those whose eyes are only turned below,</line>
      <line> Gazing upon the ground with thoughts which dare not glow?…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,</line>
      <line>With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing</line>
      <line>Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake</line>
      <line>Earth’s troubled waters for a purer spring.</line>
      <line>This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing</line>
      <line>To waft me from distraction. Once I loved</line>
      <line>Torn ocean’s roar, but thy soft murmuring</line>
      <line>Sounds sweet as if a sister’s voice reproved</line>
      <line> That I with stern delights should e’er have been so moved.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is the hush of night, and all between</line>
      <line>Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear</line>
      <line>(Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen),</line>
      <line>Save darkened Jura, whose capped heights appear</line>
      <line>Precipitously steep – and drawing near,</line>
      <line>There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,</line>
      <line>Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear</line>
      <line>Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,</line>
      <line>Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He is an evening reveller, who makes</line>
      <line>His life an infancy, and sings his fill!</line>
      <line>At intervals, some bird from out the brakes</line>
      <line>Starts into voice a moment, then is still.</line>
      <line>There seems a floating whisper on the hill –</line>
      <line>But that is fancy! – for the starlight-dews</line>
      <line>All silently their tears of love instill,</line>
      <line>Weeping themselves away, till they infuse</line>
      <line>Deep into Nature’s breast the spirit of her hues.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ye stars, which are the poetry of Heaven!</line>
      <line> If in your bright leaves we would read the fate</line>
      <line>Of men and empires, ’tis to be forgiven</line>
      <line>That in our aspirations to be great,</line>
      <line>Our destinies o’erleap their mortal state,</line>
      <line>And claim a kindred with you – for ye are</line>
      <line>A beauty and a mystery, and create</line>
      <line>In us such love and reverence from afar</line>
      <line>That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All Heaven and Earth are still – though not in sleep,</line>
      <line>But breathless, as we grow when feeling most,</line>
      <line> And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep –</line>
      <line>All Heaven and Earth are still! From the high host</line>
      <line>Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,</line>
      <line>All is concentred in a life intense</line>
      <line>Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,</line>
      <line>But hath a part of being, and a sense</line>
      <line>Of that which is of all creator and defense.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt</line>
      <line>In solitude, where we are least alone –</line>
      <line>A truth which through our being then doth melt,</line>
      <line>And purifies from self: it is a tone,</line>
      <line>The soul and source of music, which makes known</line>
      <line>Eternal harmony…</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>My sister! my sweet sister! if a name</line>
      <line>Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.</line>
      <line>Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim</line>
      <line>No tears but tenderness to answer mine:</line>
      <line> Go where I will, to me thou art the same –</line>
      <line>A loved regret which I would not resign!</line>
      <line>There yet are two things in my destiny:</line>
      <line>A world to roam through, and a home with thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The first were nothing, had I still the last!</line>
      <line>It were the haven of my happiness –</line>
      <line>But other claims and other ties thou hast,</line>
      <line>And mine is not the wish to make them less.</line>
      <line>A strange doom is thy father’s son’s, and past</line>
      <line>Recalling, as it lies beyond redress –</line>
      <line> Reversed for him our grandsire’s fate of yore:</line>
      <line>He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If my inheritance of storms hath been</line>
      <line>In other elements, and on the rocks</line>
      <line>Of perils, overlooked or unforeseen,</line>
      <line>I have sustained my share of worldly shocks,</line>
      <line>The fault was mine – nor do I seek to screen</line>
      <line>My errors with defensive paradox –</line>
      <line>I have been cunning in mine overthrow,</line>
      <line>The careful pilot of my proper woe!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.</line>
      <line>My whole life was a contest, since the day</line>
      <line>That gave me being gave me that which marred</line>
      <line>The gift – a fate, or will – that walked astray!</line>
      <line>And I at times have found the struggle hard,</line>
      <line>And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay,</line>
      <line>But now I fain would for a time survive,</line>
      <line>If but to see what next can well arrive.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Kingdoms and Empires in my little day</line>
      <line>I have outlived, and yet I am not old!</line>
      <line> And when I look on this, the petty spray</line>
      <line>Of my own years of troubles (which have rolled</line>
      <line>Like a wild bay of breakers) melts away.</line>
      <line>Something – I know not what – does still uphold</line>
      <line>A spirit of slight patience: not in vain,</line>
      <line>Even for its own sake, do we purchase pain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Perhaps the workings of defiance stir</line>
      <line>Within me – or, perhaps, a cold despair</line>
      <line>Brought on when ills habitually recur –</line>
      <line>Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air</line>
      <line> (For even to this may change of soul refer,</line>
      <line>And with light armour we may learn to bear),</line>
      <line>Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not</line>
      <line>The chief companion of a calmer lot.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I feel almost at times as I have felt</line>
      <line>In happy childhood: trees, and flowers, and brooks,</line>
      <line>Which do remember me of where I dwelt</line>
      <line>Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,</line>
      <line>Come as of yore upon me, and can melt</line>
      <line>My heart with recognition of their looks –</line>
      <line> And even at moments I could think I see</line>
      <line>Some living thing to love – but none like thee!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here are the Alpine landscapes which create</line>
      <line>A fund for contemplation – to admire</line>
      <line>Is a brief feeling of a trivial date,</line>
      <line>But something worthier do such scenes inspire.</line>
      <line>Here to be lonely is not desolate,</line>
      <line>For much I view which I could most desire,</line>
      <line>And (above all) a lake I can behold,</line>
      <line>Lovelier – not dearer – than our own of old!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh that thou wert but with me – but I grow</line>
      <line>The fool of my own wishes, and forget</line>
      <line>The solitude which I have vaunted so</line>
      <line>Has lost its praise in this but one regret.</line>
      <line>There may be others which I less may show:</line>
      <line>I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet</line>
      <line>I feel an ebb in my philosophy,</line>
      <line>And the tide rising in my altered eye.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I did remind thee of our own dear Lake,</line>
      <line>By the old Hall which may be mine no more.</line>
      <line> Leman’s is fair, but think not I forsake</line>
      <line>The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore –</line>
      <line>Sad havoc time must with my memory make</line>
      <line>Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before,</line>
      <line>Though (like all things which I have loved) they are</line>
      <line>Resigned for ever, or divided far.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The world is all before me! I but ask</line>
      <line>Of Nature that with which she will comply –</line>
      <line>It is but in her summer’s sun to bask,</line>
      <line>To mingle with the quiet of her sky,</line>
      <line> To see her gentle face without a mask,</line>
      <line>And never gaze on it with apathy.</line>
      <line>She was my early friend, and now shall be</line>
      <line>My sister – till I look again on thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I can reduce all feelings but this one –</line>
      <line>And that I would not! For at length I see</line>
      <line>Such scenes as those wherein my life begun:</line>
      <line>The earliest – even the only – paths for me.</line>
      <line>Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,</line>
      <line>I had been better than I now can be –</line>
      <line> The passions which have torn me would have slept:</line>
      <line>I had not suffered, and thou hadst not wept!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With false ambition what had I to do?</line>
      <line>Little with love, and least of all with fame!</line>
      <line>And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,</line>
      <line>And made me all which they can make, a name!</line>
      <line>Yet this was not the end I did pursue –</line>
      <line>Surely I once beheld a nobler aim –</line>
      <line>But all is over. I am one the more</line>
      <line>To baffled millions which have gone before.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And for the future, this world’s future may</line>
      <line>From me demand but little of my care –</line>
      <line>I have outlived myself by many a day,</line>
      <line>Having survived so many things that were!</line>
      <line>My years have been no slumber, but the prey</line>
      <line>Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share</line>
      <line>Of life which might have filled a century,</line>
      <line>Before its fourth in time had passed me by.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And for the remnant which may be to come</line>
      <line>I am content – and for the past I feel</line>
      <line>Not thankless – for within the crowded sum</line>
      <line>Of struggles, happiness at times would steal!</line>
      <line>And for the present, I would not benumb</line>
      <line>My feelings farther – nor shall I conceal</line>
      <line>That with all this I still can look around,</line>
      <line>And worship Nature with a thought profound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart</line>
      <line>I know myself secure, as thou in mine.</line>
      <line>We were and are – I am, even as thou art –</line>
      <line>Beings who ne’er each other can resign.</line>
      <line> It is the same, together or apart!</line>
      <line>From life’s commencement to its slow decline</line>
      <line>We are entwined – let death come slow or fast,</line>
      <line>The tie which bound the first endures the last!</line>

    <title>Mont Blanc: Lines Written in the Vale of Chamouni</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The everlasting universe of things</line>
      <line>Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,</line>
      <line>Now dark, now glittering, now reflecting gloom,</line>
      <line>Now lending splendour, where from secret springs</line>
      <line> The source of human thought its tribute brings</line>
      <line>Of waters – with a sound but half its own,</line>
      <line>Such as a feeble brook will oft assume</line>
      <line>In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,</line>
      <line>Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,</line>
      <line>Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river</line>
      <line>Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus thou, Ravine of Arve – dark, deep Ravine –</line>
      <line>Thou many-coloured, many-voicéd vale,</line>
      <line>Over whose pines, and crags, and caverns sail</line>
      <line> Fast cloud-shadows and sunbeams. Awful scene,</line>
      <line>Where Power in likeness of the Arve comes down</line>
      <line>From the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne,</line>
      <line>Bursting through these dark mountains like the flame</line>
      <line>Of lightning through the tempest! Thou dost lie,</line>
      <line>Thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging</line>
      <line>(Children of elder time, in whose devotion</line>
      <line>The chainless winds still come and ever came</line>
      <line>To drink their odours, and their mighty swinging</line>
      <line>To hear: an old and solemn harmony),</line>
      <line> Thine earthly rainbows stretched across the sweep</line>
      <line>Of the aethereal waterfall, whose veil</line>
      <line>Robes some unsculptured image – the strange sleep</line>
      <line>Which when the voices of the desert fail</line>
      <line>Wraps all in its own deep eternity –</line>
      <line>Thy caverns echoing to the Arve’s commotion,</line>
      <line>A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame!</line>
      <line>Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion,</line>
      <line>Thou art the path of that unresting sound,</line>
      <line>Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee</line>
      <line> I seem as in a trance sublime and strange</line>
      <line>To muse on my own separate fantasy,</line>
      <line>My own, my human mind, which passively</line>
      <line>Now renders and receives fast influencings,</line>
      <line>Holding an unremitting interchange</line>
      <line>With the clear universe of things around –</line>
      <line>One legion of wild thoughts, whose wandering wings</line>
      <line>Now float above thy darkness, and now rest</line>
      <line>Where that, or thou, art no unbidden guest,</line>
      <line>In the still cave of the witch Poesy,</line>
      <line> Seeking among the shadows that pass by</line>
      <line>(Ghosts of all things that are) some shade of thee,</line>
      <line>Some phantom, some faint image. Till the breast</line>
      <line>From which they fled recalls them, thou art there!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some say that gleams of a remoter world</line>
      <line>Visit the soul in sleep – that death is slumber,</line>
      <line>And that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber</line>
      <line>Of those who wake and live. I look on high:</line>
      <line>Has some unknown omnipotence unfurled</line>
      <line>The veil of life and death? Or do I lie</line>
      <line> In dream, and does the mightier world of sleep</line>
      <line>Spread far around and inaccessibly</line>
      <line>Its circles? For the very spirit fails,</line>
      <line>Driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep</line>
      <line>That vanishes among the viewless gales!</line>
      <line>Far, far above, piercing the infinite sky,</line>
      <line>Mont Blanc appears, still, snowy, and serene.</line>
      <line>Its subject mountains their unearthly forms</line>
      <line>Pile around it, ice and rock – broad vales between</line>
      <line>Of frozen floods, unfathomable deeps,</line>
      <line> Blue as the overhanging heaven, that spread</line>
      <line>And wind among the accumulated steeps –</line>
      <line>A desert peopled by the storms alone,</line>
      <line>Save when the eagle brings some hunter’s bone,</line>
      <line>And the wolf tracks her there! How hideously</line>
      <line>Its shapes are heaped around – rude, bare, and high,</line>
      <line>Ghastly, and scarred, and riven! Is this the scene</line>
      <line>Where the old Earthquake-Demon taught her young</line>
      <line>Ruin? Were these their toys? Or did a sea</line>
      <line>Of fire envelop once this silent snow?</line>
      <line> None can reply – all seems eternal now.</line>
      <line>The wilderness has a mysterious tongue</line>
      <line>Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild,</line>
      <line>So solemn, so serene, that man may be,</line>
      <line>But for such faith, with Nature reconciled.</line>
      <line>Thou hast a voice, great Mountain, to repeal</line>
      <line>Large codes of fraud and woe – not understood</line>
      <line>By all, but which the wise, and great, and good</line>
      <line>Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The fields, the lakes, the forests, and the streams,</line>
      <line> Ocean, and all the living things that dwell</line>
      <line>Within the daedal earth; lightning and rain,</line>
      <line>Earthquake and fiery flood, and hurricane;</line>
      <line>The torpor of the year when feeble dreams</line>
      <line>Visit the hidden buds, or dreamless sleep</line>
      <line>Holds every future leaf and flower; the bound</line>
      <line>With which from that detested trance they leap;</line>
      <line>The works and ways of man, their death and birth,</line>
      <line>And that of him and all that his may be;</line>
      <line>All things that move and breathe with toil and sound</line>
      <line> Are born and die; revolve, subside, and swell.</line>
      <line>Power dwells apart in its tranquillity,</line>
      <line>Remote, serene and inaccessible,</line>
      <line>And this the naked countenance of earth</line>
      <line>On which I gaze, even these primeval mountains,</line>
      <line>Teach the adverting mind. The glaciers creep</line>
      <line>Like snakes that watch their prey, from their far fountains</line>
      <line>Slow rolling on. There, many a precipice</line>
      <line>Frost and the sun, in scorn of mortal power,</line>
      <line>Have piled: dome, pyramid, and pinnacle –</line>
      <line>A city of death, distinct with many a tower</line>
      <line>And wall impregnable of beaming ice.</line>
      <line>Yet not a city, but a flood of ruin</line>
      <line>Is there, that from the boundaries of the sky</line>
      <line>Rolls its perpetual stream: Vast pines are strewing</line>
      <line>Its destined path, or in the mangled soil</line>
      <line>Branchless and shattered stand.</line>
      <line>The rocks, drawn down</line>
      <line>From yon remotest waste, have overthrown</line>
      <line>The limits of the dead and living world,</line>
      <line>Never to be reclaimed. The dwelling-place</line>
      <line> Of insects, beasts and birds, becomes its spoil;</line>
      <line>Their food and their retreat for ever gone,</line>
      <line>So much of life and joy is lost. The race</line>
      <line>Of man flies far in dread; his work and dwelling</line>
      <line>Vanish like smoke before the tempest’s stream,</line>
      <line>And their place is not known. Below, vast caves</line>
      <line>Shine in the rushing torrents’ restless gleam,</line>
      <line>Which from those secret chasms in tumult welling</line>
      <line>Meet in the vale, and one majestic river,</line>
      <line>The breath and blood of distant lands, for ever</line>
      <line> Rolls its loud waters to the ocean-waves,</line>
      <line>Breathes its swift vapours to the circling air.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mont Blanc yet gleams on high – the power is there,</line>
      <line>The still and solemn power of many sights,</line>
      <line>And many sounds, and much of life and death.</line>
      <line>In the calm darkness of the moonless nights,</line>
      <line>In the lone glare of day, the snows descend</line>
      <line>Upon that Mountain; none beholds them there,</line>
      <line>Nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun,</line>
      <line>Or the star-beams dart through them. Winds contend</line>
      <line> Silently there, and heap the snow with breath</line>
      <line>Rapid and strong, but silently! Its home</line>
      <line>The voiceless lightning in these solitudes</line>
      <line>Keeps innocently, and like vapour broods</line>
      <line>Over the snow. The secret Strength of Things</line>
      <line>Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome</line>
      <line>Of heaven is as a law, inhabits thee!</line>
      <line>And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,</line>
      <line>If to the human mind’s imaginings</line>
      <line>Silence and solitude were vacancy?</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Best and brightest, come away –</line>
      <line>Fairer far than this fair day,</line>
      <line>Which, like thee to those in sorrow,</line>
      <line>Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow</line>
      <line> To the rough year just awake</line>
      <line>In its cradle on the brake.</line>
      <line>The brightest hour of unborn spring,</line>
      <line>Through the winter wandering,</line>
      <line>Found, it seems, this halcyon morn</line>
      <line>To hoar February born –</line>
      <line>Bending from heaven, in azure mirth,</line>
      <line>It kissed the forehead of the Earth,</line>
      <line>And smiled upon the silent sea,</line>
      <line>And bade the frozen streams be free,</line>
      <line> And waked to music all their fountains,</line>
      <line>And breathed upon the frozen mountains,</line>
      <line>And like a prophetess of May</line>
      <line>Strewed flowers upon the barren way,</line>
      <line>Making the wintry world appear</line>
      <line>Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.</line>
      <line>Away, away, from men and towns</line>
      <line>To the wild wood and the downs,</line>
      <line>To the silent wilderness</line>
      <line>Where the soul need not repress</line>
      <line> Its music lest it should not find</line>
      <line>An echo in another’s mind,</line>
      <line>While the touch of Nature’s art</line>
      <line>Harmonizes heart to heart.</line>
      <line>I leave this notice on my door</line>
      <line>For each accustomed visitor:</line>
      <line>‘I am gone into the fields</line>
      <line>To take what this sweet hour yields!</line>
      <line>Reflection, you may come tomorrow,</line>
      <line>Sit by the fireside with Sorrow –</line>
      <line> You with the unpaid bill, Despair,</line>
      <line>You, tiresome verse-reciter, Care!</line>
      <line>I will pay you in the grave –</line>
      <line>Death will listen to your stave!</line>
      <line>Expectation too, be off –</line>
      <line>Today is for itself enough!</line>
      <line>Hope, in pity mock not Woe</line>
      <line>With smiles, nor follow where I go.</line>
      <line>Long having lived on thy sweet food,</line>
      <line>At length I find one moment’s good</line>
      <line> After long pain – with all your love,</line>
      <line>This you never told me of!’</line>
      <line>Radiant sister of the day,</line>
      <line>Awake, arise, and come away!</line>
      <line>To the wild woods and the plains,</line>
      <line>And the pools where winter-rains</line>
      <line>Image all their roof of leaves,</line>
      <line>Where the pine its garland weaves</line>
      <line>Of sapless green and ivy dun</line>
      <line>Round stems that never kiss the sun –</line>
      <line> Where the lawns and pastures be,</line>
      <line>And the sandhills of the sea –</line>
      <line>Where the melting hoar-frost wets</line>
      <line>The daisy-star that never sets,</line>
      <line>And wind-flowers, and violets,</line>
      <line>Which yet join not scent to hue,</line>
      <line>Crown the pale year weak and new;</line>
      <line>When the night is left behind</line>
      <line>In the deep east, dun and blind,</line>
      <line>And the blue noon is over us,</line>
      <line> And the multitudinous</line>
      <line>Billows murmur at our feet,</line>
      <line>Where the earth and ocean meet,</line>
      <line>And all things seem only one</line>
      <line>In the universal sun.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Now the last day of many days,</line>
      <line>All beautiful and bright as thou,</line>
      <line>The loveliest and the last, is dead –</line>
      <line>Rise, Memory, and write its praise!</line>
      <line> Up, to thy wonted work! Come, trace</line>
      <line>The epitaph of glory fled;</line>
      <line>For now the Earth has changed its face,</line>
      <line>A frown is on the Heaven’s brow.</line>
      <line>We wandered to the pine forest</line>
      <line>That skirts the ocean-foam,</line>
      <line>The lightest wind was in its nest,</line>
      <line>The tempest in its home.</line>
      <line>The whispering waves were half asleep,</line>
      <line>The clouds were gone to play,</line>
      <line> And on the bosom of the deep</line>
      <line>The smile of Heaven lay –</line>
      <line>It seemed as if the hour were one</line>
      <line>Sent from beyond the skies,</line>
      <line>Which scattered from above the sun</line>
      <line>A light of Paradise!</line>
      <line>We paused amid the pines that stood</line>
      <line>The giants of the waste,</line>
      <line>Tortured by storms to shapes as rude</line>
      <line>As serpents interlaced,</line>
      <line> And soothed by every azure breath,</line>
      <line>That under Heaven is blown,</line>
      <line>To harmonies and hues beneath,</line>
      <line>As tender as its own –</line>
      <line>Now all the tree-tops lay asleep,</line>
      <line>Like green waves on the sea,</line>
      <line>As still as in the silent deep</line>
      <line>The ocean-woods may be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How calm it was – the silence there</line>
      <line>By such a chain was bound</line>
      <line> That even the busy woodpecker</line>
      <line>Made stiller by her sound</line>
      <line>The inviolable quietness!</line>
      <line>The breath of peace we drew,</line>
      <line>With its soft motion, made not less</line>
      <line>The calm that round us grew.</line>
      <line>There seemed from the remotest seat</line>
      <line>Of the white mountain-waste,</line>
      <line>To the soft flower beneath our feet,</line>
      <line>A magic circle traced –</line>
      <line> A spirit interfused around,</line>
      <line>A thrilling, silent life!</line>
      <line>To momentary peace it bound</line>
      <line>Our mortal nature’s strife –</line>
      <line>And still I felt the centre of</line>
      <line>The magic circle there</line>
      <line>Was one fair form that filled with love</line>
      <line>The lifeless atmosphere.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We paused beside the pools that lie</line>
      <line>Under the forest bough:</line>
      <line> Each seemed as ’twere a little sky</line>
      <line>Gulfed in a world below –</line>
      <line>A firmament of purple light</line>
      <line>Which in the dark earth lay,</line>
      <line>More boundless than the depth of night,</line>
      <line>And purer than the day!</line>
      <line>In which the lovely forests grew,</line>
      <line>As in the upper air,</line>
      <line>More perfect both in shape and hue</line>
      <line>Than any spreading there.</line>
      <line> There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn,</line>
      <line>And through the dark green wood</line>
      <line>The white sun twinkling like the dawn</line>
      <line>Out of a speckled cloud.</line>
      <line>Sweet views, which in our world above</line>
      <line>Can never well be seen,</line>
      <line>Were imaged by the water’s love</line>
      <line>Of that fair forest green.</line>
      <line>And all was interfused beneath</line>
      <line>With an Elysian glow,</line>
      <line> An atmosphere without a breath,</line>
      <line>A softer day below.</line>
      <line>Like one beloved the scene had lent</line>
      <line>To the dark water’s breast,</line>
      <line>Its every leaf and lineament</line>
      <line>With more than truth exprest –</line>
      <line>Until an envious wind crept by,</line>
      <line>Like an unwelcome thought,</line>
      <line>Which from the mind’s too faithful eye</line>
      <line>Blots one dear image out.</line>
      <line> Though thou art ever fair and kind,</line>
      <line>The forests ever green,</line>
      <line>Less oft is peace in Shelley’s mind,</line>
      <line>Than calm in waters, seen!</line>

      <line>Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks</line>
      <line>Our ready minds to fellowship divine,</line>

      <line>Of music’s kiss impregnates the free winds,</line>
      <line> And with a sympathetic touch unbinds</line>
      <line>Eolian magic from their lucid wombs –</line>
      <line>Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs,</line>
      <line>Old ditties sigh above their father’s grave,</line>
      <line>Ghosts of melodious prophesyings rave</line>
      <line>Round every spot where trod Apollo’s foot;</line>
      <line>Bronze clarions awake and faintly bruit</line>
      <line>Where long ago a giant-battle was;</line>
      <line>And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass</line>
      <line>In every place where infant Orpheus slept.</line>
      <line> Feel we these things? That moment have we stepped</line>
      <line>Into a sort of oneness, and our state</line>
      <line>Is like a floating spirit’s. But there are</line>
      <line>Richer entanglements, enthralments far</line>
      <line>More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,</line>
      <line>To the chief intensity: the crown of these</line>
      <line>Is made of love and friendship, and sits high</line>
      <line>Upon the forehead of humanity.</line>

    <title>from Epistle to J. H. Reynolds</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is a flaw</line>
      <line>In happiness to see beyond our bourne –</line>
      <line>It forces us in summer skies to mourn;</line>
      <line> It spoils the singing of the nightingale.</line>
      <line>Dear Reynolds, I have a mysterious tale</line>
      <line>And cannot speak it. The first page I read</line>
      <line>Upon a limpit-rock of green sea-weed</line>
      <line>Among the breakers. ’Twas a quiet eve;</line>
      <line>The rocks were silent; the wide sea did weave</line>
      <line>An untumultuous fringe of silver foam</line>
      <line>Along the flat brown sand. I was at home,</line>
      <line>And should have been most happy, but I saw</line>
      <line>Too far into the sea, where every maw,</line>
      <line> The greater on the less, feeds evermore –</line>
      <line>But I saw too distinct into the core</line>
      <line>Of an eternal fierce destruction,</line>
      <line>And so from happiness I far was gone.</line>
      <line>Still am I sick of it; and though today</line>
      <line>I’ve gathered young spring-leaves, and flowers gay</line>
      <line>Of periwinkle and wild strawberry,</line>
      <line>Still do I that most fierce destruction see:</line>
      <line>The shark at savage prey, the hawk at pounce,</line>
      <line>The gentle robin, like a pard or ounce,</line>
      <line>Ravening a worm.</line>

      <line>And now the trembling light</line>

      <line>The Faithful Witness, pure and white,</line>

      <line>Now and then –</line>
      <line>And now and then.</line>
      <line>Hark! once again,</line>
      <line>The wether’s bell to us doth tell</line>
      <line>Some little stirring in the fold.</line>
      <line>Methinks the lingering, dying ray</line>
      <line>Of twilight time doth seem more fair,</line>
      <line>And lights the soul up more than day,</line>
      <line>When wide-spread, sultry sunshines are...</line>

    <title>This Leaning Tree with Ivy Overhung</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>This leaning tree with ivy overhung,</line>
      <line>This crooked brook o’er which is rudely flung</line>
      <line>A slender plank that bends beneath the feet,</line>
      <line>And that small hill the shepherd’s summer seat,</line>
      <line> Make up a picture to the mind and wear</line>
      <line>A nobler gild than palace-walls can heir.</line>
      <line>To me the wild wind dashes o’er the scene</line>
      <line>Enchantment’s shades of vivifying green:</line>
      <line>I see her, sketchy pencil in her hand,</line>
      <line>Painting the moving scene to fairy land!</line>
      <line>That blackbird’s music from the hazel bower</line>
      <line>Turns into golden drops this summer shower –</line>
      <line>To think the rain that wets his sooty wing</line>
      <line>Should wake the gushes of his soul to sing!</line>
      <line> Hark at the melody, how rich and loud</line>
      <line>(Like daylight breaking through the morning cloud),</line>
      <line>How luscious through that sea of green it floats!</line>
      <line>Knowst thou of music breathed from sweeter notes</line>
      <line>Than that wild minstrel of the summer shower</line>
      <line>Breathes at this moment from that hazel-bower?</line>
      <line>To me the anthem of a thousand tongues</line>
      <line>Were poor and idle to the simple songs</line>
      <line>Of that high-toned and edifying bird</line>
      <line>That sings to Nature, by itself, unheard.</line>
      <line> There is a language wrote on earth and sky</line>
      <line>By God’s own pen in silent majesty;</line>
      <line>There is a voice that’s heard and felt and seen</line>
      <line>In spring’s young shades and summer’s endless green;</line>
      <line>There is a book of poesy and spells</line>
      <line>In which that voice in sunny splendour dwells;</line>
      <line>There is a page in which that voice aloud</line>
      <line>Speaks music to the few, and not the crowd!</line>
      <line>Though no romantic scenes my feet hath trod,</line>
      <line>The voice of Nature, as the voice of God,</line>
      <line> Appeals to me in every tree and flower,</line>
      <line>Breathing his glory, magnitude and power.</line>
      <line>In Nature’s open book I read, and see</line>
      <line>Beauty’s rich lesson in this seeming pea.</line>
      <line>Crowds see no magic in this trifling thing –</line>
      <line>‘Pshaw, ’tis a weed, and millions come with spring!’</line>
      <line>I hear rich music whereso’er I look,</line>
      <line>But heedless worldlings chide the brawling brook.</line>
      <line>And that small lark between me and the sky</line>
      <line>Breathes sweetest strains of morning’s melody –</line>
      <line> Yet by the heedless crowd ’tis only heard</line>
      <line>As the small warbling of a common bird</line>
      <line>That o’er the plough-teams hails the morning-sun.</line>
      <line>They see no music from such magic won;</line>
      <line>Yet I see melody in Nature’s laws –</line>
      <line>Or do I dream? Still wonder bids me pause.</line>
      <line>I pause and hear a voice that speaks aloud:</line>
      <line>‘’Tis not on earth, nor in the thunder-cloud!</line>
      <line>The many look for sound, ’tis silence speaks –</line>
      <line>And song, like sunshine, from her rapture breaks.’</line>
      <line> I hear it in my bosom, ever near,</line>
      <line>’Tis in these winds, and they are everywhere –</line>
      <line>It casts around my vision magic spells,</line>
      <line>And makes earth Heaven, where poor fancy dwells!</line>
      <line>I read its speech, and its speech is joy!</line>
      <line>So, without teaching, when a lonely boy,</line>
      <line>Each weed to me did happy tidings bring</line>
      <line>(Plain as the daisy wrote the name of spring),</line>
      <line>And God’s own language, unto Nature given,</line>
      <line>Seemed universal as the light of Heaven</line>
      <line> And common as the grass upon the plain</line>
      <line>That all may read and meet with joy again –</line>
      <line>Save the unheeding heart, who, like the tomb,</line>
      <line>Shuts joy in darkness, and forbids its bloom.</line>

      <line>Feeding my thoughts in primrose-haunted nooks</line>
      <line>With fairy fantasies and wood-dreams lone;</line>
      <line> And thou didst teach me every wandering tone</line>
      <line>Drawn from thy many-whispering trees and waves,</line>
      <line>And guide my steps to founts and sparry caves,</line>
      <line>And where bright mosses wove thee a rich throne</line>
      <line>Midst the green hills. And now that, far estranged</line>
      <line>O From all sweet sounds and odours of thy breath,</line>
      <line>Fading I lie, within my heart unchanged</line>
      <line>So glows the love of thee that not for death</line>
      <line>Seems that pure passion’s fervour, but ordained</line>
      <line>To meet on brighter shores thy majesty unstained.</line>

      <line>To me alone there came a thought of grief.</line>
      <line>A timely utterance gave that thought relief,</line>

      <line>Land and sea</line>
      <line>Give themselves up to jollity,</line>

      <line>But there’s a tree, of many one,</line>
      <line>A single field which I have looked upon –</line>
      <line>Both of them speak of something that is gone.</line>
      <line>The pansy at my feet</line>

      <line>Shades of the prison-house begin to close</line>

      <line>He sees it in his joy.</line>
      <line>The youth, who daily farther from the east</line>
      <line>Must travel, still is Nature’s priest</line>
      <line>And by the vision splendid</line>
      <line>Is on his way attended;</line>
      <line> At length the man perceives it die away</line>
      <line>And fade into the light of common day.</line>

      <line>Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own:</line>
      <line>Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,</line>
      <line>And even with something of a mother’s mind</line>
      <line>And no unworthy aim</line>
      <line>The homely nurse doth all she can</line>
      <line>To make her foster-child, her inmate, man,</line>

      <line> Behold the child among his new-born blisses,</line>
      <line>A four years’ darling of a pigmy size –</line>
      <line>See where, mid work of his own hand, he lies,</line>
      <line>Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,</line>
      <line>With light upon him from his father’s eyes!</line>
      <line>See at his feet some little plan or chart,</line>
      <line>Some fragment from his dream of human life</line>
      <line>Shaped by himself with newly-learnéd art</line>
      <line>(A wedding or a festival,</line>
      <line>A mourning or a funeral),</line>
      <line> And this hath now his heart,</line>
      <line>And unto this he frames his song.</line>
      <line>Then he will fit his tongue</line>
      <line>To dialogues of business, love or strife;</line>
      <line>But it will not be long</line>
      <line>Ere this be thrown aside,</line>
      <line>And with new joy and pride</line>
      <line>The little actor cons another part,</line>
      <line>Filling from time to time his ‘humourous stage’</line>
      <line>With all the persons down to palsied age</line>
      <line>That life brings with her in her equipage–</line>
      <line>As if his whole vocation</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Thou whose exterior semblance doth belie</line>
      <line>Thy soul’s immensity,</line>
      <line>Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep</line>
      <line>Thy heritage – thou eye among the blind</line>
      <line>That, deaf and silent, readst the eternal deep,</line>
      <line>Haunted for ever by the eternal mind;</line>
      <line>Mighty prophet, seer blest,</line>
      <line> On whom those truths do rest</line>
      <line>Which we are toiling all our lives to find!</line>
      <line>Thou over whom thy immortality</line>
      <line>Broods like the day, a master o’er a slave –</line>
      <line>A presence which is not to be put by –</line>
      <line>To whom the grave</line>
      <line>Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight</line>
      <line>Of day or the warm light,</line>
      <line>A place of thought where we in waiting lie;</line>
      <line>Thou little child, yet glorious in the might</line>
      <line> Of untamed pleasures, on thy being’s height</line>
      <line>Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke</line>
      <line>The years to bring the inevitable yoke,</line>
      <line>Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?</line>
      <line>Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,</line>
      <line>And custom lie upon thee with a weight</line>
      <line>Heavy as frost and deep almost as life!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh joy that in our embers</line>
      <line>Is something that doth live,</line>
      <line>That nature yet remembers</line>
      <line> What was so fugitive!</line>
      <line>The thought of our past years in me doth breed</line>
      <line>Perpetual benedictions; not indeed</line>
      <line>For that which is most worthy to be blest –</line>
      <line>Delight and liberty, the simple creed</line>
      <line>Of childhood, whether fluttering or at rest,</line>
      <line>With new-born hope for ever in his breast –</line>
      <line>Not for these I raise</line>
      <line>The song of thanks and praise,</line>
      <line>But for those obstinate questionings</line>
      <line> Of sense and outward things,</line>
      <line>Fallings from us, vanishings,</line>
      <line>Blank misgivings of a creature</line>
      <line>Moving about in worlds not realized,</line>
      <line>High instincts, before which our mortal nature</line>
      <line>Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised –</line>
      <line>But for those first affections,</line>
      <line>Those shadowy recollections</line>
      <line>Which be they what they may</line>
      <line>Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,</line>
      <line> Are yet the master-light of all our seeing;</line>
      <line>Uphold us, cherish us, and make</line>
      <line>Our noisy years seem moments in the being</line>
      <line>Of the eternal silence – truths that wake</line>
      <line>To perish never,</line>
      <line>Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,</line>
      <line>Nor man nor boy,</line>
      <line>Nor all that is at enmity with joy,</line>
      <line>Can utterly abolish or destroy!</line>
      <line>Hence in a season of calm weather,</line>
      <line> Though inland far we be,</line>
      <line>Our souls have sight of that immortal sea</line>
      <line>Which brought us hither,</line>
      <line>Can in a moment travel thither</line>
      <line>And see the children sport upon the shore,</line>
      <line>And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then sing ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song,</line>
      <line>And let the young lambs bound</line>
      <line>As to the tabor’s sound!</line>
      <line>We in thought will join your throng –</line>
      <line> Ye that pipe and ye that play,</line>
      <line>Ye that through your hearts today</line>
      <line>Feel the gladness of the May!</line>
      <line>What though the radiance which was once so bright</line>
      <line>Be now forever taken from my sight,</line>
      <line>Though nothing can bring back the hour</line>
      <line>Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower,</line>
      <line>We will grieve not, rather find</line>
      <line>Strength in what remains behind:</line>
      <line>In the primal sympathy</line>
      <line> Which having been must ever be,</line>
      <line>In the soothing thoughts that spring</line>
      <line>Out of human suffering,</line>
      <line>In the faith that looks through death,</line>
      <line>In years that bring the philosophic mind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And oh ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,</line>
      <line>Think not of any severing of our loves;</line>
      <line>Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might –</line>
      <line>I only have relinquished one delight</line>
      <line>To live beneath your more habitual sway!</line>
      <line> I love the brooks which down their channels fret,</line>
      <line>Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;</line>
      <line>The innocent brightness of a new-born day</line>
      <line>Is lovely yet;</line>
      <line>The clouds that gather round the setting sun</line>
      <line>Do take a sober colouring from an eye</line>
      <line>That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;</line>
      <line>Another race hath been, and other palms are won.</line>
      <line>Thanks to the human heart by which we live –</line>
      <line>Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears –</line>
      <line>To me the meanest flower that blows can give</line>
      <line>Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.</line>

    <title>Dejection: An Ode</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well, if the bard was weather-wise, who made</line>
      <line>The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spens,</line>
      <line>This night, so tranquil now, will not go hence</line>
      <line>Unroused by winds, that ply a busier trade</line>
      <line> Than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes,</line>
      <line>Or the dull sobbing draught, that drones and rakes</line>
      <line>Upon the strings of this Eolian lute,</line>
      <line>Which better far were mute.</line>
      <line>For lo! the new moon, winter-bright</line>
      <line>And overspread with phantom light –</line>
      <line>With swimming phantom light o’erspread,</line>
      <line>But rimmed and circled by a silver thread –</line>
      <line>I see the old moon in her lap, foretelling</line>
      <line>The coming-on of rain and squally blast.</line>
      <line> And oh, that even now the gust were swelling,</line>
      <line>And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast!</line>
      <line>Those sounds which oft have raised me, while they awed,</line>
      <line>And sent my soul abroad,</line>
      <line>Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give,</line>
      <line>Might startle this dull pain, and make it move and live!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear,</line>
      <line>A stifled, drowsy, unimpassioned grief,</line>
      <line>Which finds no natural outlet, no relief,</line>
      <line>In word, or sigh, or tear –</line>
      <line> Oh Edmund, in this wan and heartless mood,</line>
      <line>To other thoughts by yonder throstle wooed,</line>
      <line>All this long eve, so balmy and serene,</line>
      <line>Have I been gazing on the western sky,</line>
      <line>And its peculiar tint of yellow-green –</line>
      <line>And still I gaze – and with how blank an eye!</line>
      <line>And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars,</line>
      <line>That give away their motion to the stars;</line>
      <line>Those stars, that glide behind them or between,</line>
      <line>Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen;</line>
      <line> Yon crescent moon, as fixed as if it grew</line>
      <line>In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue –</line>
      <line>A boat becalmed, a lovely sky-canoe!</line>
      <line>I see them all, so excellently fair,</line>
      <line>I see, not feel, how beautiful they are!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My genial spirits fail;</line>
      <line>And what can these avail</line>
      <line>To lift the smothering weight from off my breast?</line>
      <line>It were a vain endeavour,</line>
      <line>Though I should gaze for ever</line>
      <line> On that green light that lingers in the west:</line>
      <line>I may not hope from outward forms to win</line>
      <line>The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Edmund, we receive but what we give,</line>
      <line>And in our life alone does Nature live:</line>
      <line>Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud!</line>
      <line>And would we aught behold of higher worth</line>
      <line>Than that inanimate cold world allowed</line>
      <line>To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,</line>
      <line>Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth</line>
      <line> A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud</line>
      <line>Enveloping the earth –</line>
      <line>And from the soul itself must there be sent</line>
      <line>A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,</line>
      <line>Of all sweet sounds the life and element.</line>
      <line>Oh pure of heart, thou needst not ask of me</line>
      <line>What this strong music in the soul may be –</line>
      <line>What, and wherein it doth exist,</line>
      <line>This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist,</line>
      <line>This beautiful and beauty-making power.</line>
      <line> Joy, virtuous Edmund – joy that ne’er was given,</line>
      <line>Save to the pure, and in their purest hour –</line>
      <line>Joy, Edmund, is the spirit and the power</line>
      <line>Which, wedding Nature to us, gives in dower</line>
      <line>A new Earth and new Heaven,</line>
      <line>Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud!</line>
      <line>Joy is the sweet voice, joy the luminous cloud –</line>
      <line>We, we ourselves, rejoice!</line>
      <line>And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight –</line>
      <line>All melodies the echoes of that voice,</line>
      <line> All colours a suffusion from that light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, dearest Edmund, yes,</line>
      <line>There was a time when, though my path was rough,</line>
      <line>This joy within me dallied with distress,</line>
      <line>And all misfortunes were but as the stuff</line>
      <line>Whence fancy made me dreams of happiness;</line>
      <line>For hope grew round me like the twining vine,</line>
      <line>And fruits and foliage not my own, seemed mine!</line>
      <line>But now afflictions bow me down to earth –</line>
      <line>Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth,</line>
      <line> But oh, each visitation</line>
      <line>Suspends what Nature gave me at my birth,</line>
      <line>My shaping spirit of imagination!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, wherefore did I let it haunt my mind,</line>
      <line>This dark distressful dream?</line>
      <line>I turn from it and listen to the wind,</line>
      <line>Which long has raved unnoticed. What a scream</line>
      <line>Of agony, by torture lengthened out,</line>
      <line>That lute sent forth! Thou wind, that ravest without!</line>
      <line>Bare crag, or mountain-tairn, or blasted tree,</line>
      <line> Or pine-grove whither woodman never clomb,</line>
      <line>Or lonely house, long held the witches’ home,</line>
      <line>Methinks were fitter instruments for thee,</line>
      <line>Mad lutanist, who in this month of showers,</line>
      <line>Of dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flowers,</line>
      <line>Makest devils’ yule, with worse than wintry song</line>
      <line>The blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among.</line>
      <line>Thou actor, perfect in all tragic sounds!</line>
      <line>Thou mighty poet, even to frenzy bold!</line>
      <line>What tellest thou now about?</line>
      <line>’Tis of the rushing of an host in rout,</line>
      <line>With many groans of men with smarting wounds –</line>
      <line>At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold!</line>
      <line>But hush, there is a pause of deepest silence!</line>
      <line>And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd,</line>
      <line>With groans and tremulous shudderings – all is over!</line>
      <line>It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud,</line>
      <line>A tale of less affright</line>
      <line>And tempered with delight,</line>
      <line>As Edmund’s self had framed the tender lay.</line>
      <line> ’Tis of a little child</line>
      <line>Upon a lonesome wild</line>
      <line>Not far from home, but she has lost her way</line>
      <line>And now moans low in utter grief and fear,</line>
      <line>And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis midnight, and small thoughts have I of sleep –</line>
      <line>Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep!</line>
      <line>Visit him, gentle sleep, with wings of healing,</line>
      <line>And may this storm be but a mountain-birth,</line>
      <line>May all the stars hang bright above his dwelling,</line>
      <line> Silent as though they watched the sleeping Earth!</line>
      <line>With light heart may he rise,</line>
      <line>Gay fancy, cheerful eyes,</line>
      <line>And sing his lofty song, and teach me to rejoice!</line>
      <line>Oh Edmund, friend of my devoutest choice,</line>
      <line>Oh, raised from anxious dread and busy care</line>
      <line>By the immenseness of the good and fair</line>
      <line>Which thou seest everywhere –</line>
      <line>Joy lifts thy spirit, joy attunes thy voice;</line>
      <line>To thee do all things live, from pole to pole,</line>
      <line> Their life the eddying of thy living soul!</line>
      <line>Oh simple spirit, guided from above;</line>
      <line>Oh lofty poet, full of light and love;</line>
      <line>Brother and friend of my devoutest of my choice,</line>
      <line>Thus mayst thou ever, evermore rejoice!</line>

    <title>Hymn to Intellectual Beauty</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The awful shadow of some unseen power</line>
      <line>Floats, though unseen, among us – visiting</line>
      <line>This various world with as inconstant wing</line>
      <line>As summer winds that creep from flower to flower.</line>
      <line> Like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain-shower,</line>
      <line>It visits with inconstant glance</line>
      <line>Each human heart and countenance:</line>
      <line>Like hues and harmonies of evening,</line>
      <line>Like clouds in starlight widely spread,</line>
      <line>Like memory of music fled –</line>
      <line>Like aught that for its grace may be</line>
      <line>Dear, and yet dearer for its mystery.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Spirit of Beauty – that dost consecrate</line>
      <line>With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon</line>
      <line> Of human thought or form – where art thou gone?</line>
      <line>Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,</line>
      <line>This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?</line>
      <line>Ask why the sunlight not for ever</line>
      <line>Weaves rainbows o’er yon mountain-river,</line>
      <line>Why aught should fail and fade that once is shown,</line>
      <line>Why fear and dream and death and birth</line>
      <line>Cast on the daylight of this earth</line>
      <line>Such gloom – why man has such a scope</line>
      <line>For love and hate, despondency and hope?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> No voice from some sublimer world hath ever</line>
      <line>To sage or poet these responses given,</line>
      <line>Therefore the names of Demon, Ghost, and Heaven,</line>
      <line>Remain the records of their vain endeavour –</line>
      <line>Frail spells, whose uttered charm might not avail to sever,</line>
      <line>From all we hear and all we see,</line>
      <line>Doubt, chance, and mutability.</line>
      <line>Thy light alone – like mist o’er mountains driven,</line>
      <line>Or music by the night-wind sent</line>
      <line>Through strings of some still instrument,</line>
      <line> Or moonlight on a midnight stream –</line>
      <line>Gives grace and truth to life’s unquiet dream.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love, hope, and self-esteem, like clouds depart</line>
      <line>And come, for some uncertain moments lent.</line>
      <line>Man were immortal, and omnipotent,</line>
      <line>Didst thou, unknown and awful as thou art,</line>
      <line>Keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart!</line>
      <line>Thou messenger of sympathies,</line>
      <line>That wax and wane in lovers’ eyes,</line>
      <line>Thou that to human thought art nourishment</line>
      <line> Like darkness to a dying flame,</line>
      <line>Depart not as thy shadow came –</line>
      <line>Depart not, lest the grave should be,</line>
      <line>Like life and fear, a dark reality.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While yet a boy I sought for ghosts, and sped</line>
      <line>Through many a listening chamber, cave and ruin,</line>
      <line>And starlight wood, with fearful steps pursuing</line>
      <line>Hopes of high talk with the departed dead.</line>
      <line>I called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed –</line>
      <line>I was not heard! I saw them not!</line>
      <line> When musing deeply on the lot</line>
      <line>Of life, at that sweet time when winds are wooing</line>
      <line>All vital things that wake to bring</line>
      <line>News of birds and blossoming,</line>
      <line>Sudden thy shadow fell on me –</line>
      <line>I shrieked, and clasped my hands in ecstasy!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I vowed that I would dedicate my powers</line>
      <line>To thee and thine – have I not kept the vow?</line>
      <line>With beating heart and streaming eyes, even now</line>
      <line>I call the phantoms of a thousand hours</line>
      <line> Each from his voiceless grave! They have in visioned bowers</line>
      <line>Of studious zeal, or love’s delight,</line>
      <line>Outwatched with me the envious night –</line>
      <line>They know that never joy illumed my brow</line>
      <line>Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free</line>
      <line>This world from its dark slavery,</line>
      <line>That thou, oh awful Loveliness,</line>
      <line>Wouldst give whate’er these words cannot express.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The day becomes more solemn and serene</line>
      <line>When noon is past; there is a harmony</line>
      <line> In autumn, and a lustre in its sky,</line>
      <line>Which through the summer is not heard or seen –</line>
      <line>As if it could not be, as if it had not been!</line>
      <line>Thus let thy power, which like the truth</line>
      <line>Of Nature on my passive youth</line>
      <line>Descended, to my onward life supply</line>
      <line>Its calm – to one who worships thee,</line>
      <line>And every form containing thee,</line>

    <title>Ode to Psyche</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Goddess, hear these tuneless numbers, wrung</line>
      <line>By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear,</line>
      <line>And pardon that thy secrets should be sung</line>
      <line>Even into thine own soft-conchéd ear!</line>
      <line> Surely I dreamt to-day, or did I see</line>
      <line>The wingéd Psyche with awakened eyes?</line>
      <line>I wandered in a forest thoughtlessly,</line>
      <line>And, on the sudden, fainting with surprise,</line>
      <line>Saw two fair creatures, couchéd side by side</line>
      <line>In deepest grass, beneath the whispering roof</line>
      <line>Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran</line>
      <line>A brooklet, scarce espied.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mid hushed, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant-eyed,</line>
      <line>Blue, silver-white, and budded Tyrian,</line>
      <line> They lay calm-breathing on the bedded grass.</line>
      <line>Their arms embracéd, and their pinions too;</line>
      <line>Their lips touched not, but had not bade adieu,</line>
      <line>As if disjoinéd by soft-handed slumber,</line>
      <line>And ready still past kisses to outnumber</line>
      <line>At tender eye-dawn of aurorean love:</line>
      <line>The wingéd boy I knew –</line>
      <line>But who wast thou, oh happy, happy dove?</line>
      <line>His Psyche true!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh latest born and loveliest vision far</line>
      <line> Of all Olympus’ faded hierarchy!</line>
      <line>Fairer than Phoebe’s sapphire-regioned star,</line>
      <line>Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky –</line>
      <line>Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,</line>
      <line>Nor altar heaped with flowers;</line>
      <line>Nor virgin-choir to make delicious moan</line>
      <line>Upon the midnight hours –</line>
      <line>No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet</line>
      <line>From chain-swung censer teeming;</line>
      <line>No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat</line>
      <line> Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh brightest, though too late for antique vows!</line>
      <line>Too, too late for the fond believing lyre,</line>
      <line>When holy were the haunted forest-boughs,</line>
      <line>Holy the air, the water, and the fire.</line>
      <line>Yet even in these days, so far retired</line>
      <line>From happy pieties, thy lucent fans,</line>
      <line>Fluttering among the faint Olympians,</line>
      <line>I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired.</line>
      <line>So let me be thy choir, and make a moan</line>
      <line> Upon the midnight hours –</line>
      <line>Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet</line>
      <line>From swingéd censer teeming;</line>
      <line>Thy shrine, thy grove, thy oracle, thy heat</line>
      <line>Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane</line>
      <line>In some untrodden region of my mind,</line>
      <line>Where branchéd thoughts, new grown with pleasant pain,</line>
      <line>Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind.</line>
      <line>Far, far around shall those dark-clustered trees</line>
      <line> Fledge the wild-ridgéd mountains steep by steep;</line>
      <line>And there by zephyrs, streams, and birds, and bees,</line>
      <line>The moss-lain dryads shall be lulled to sleep.</line>
      <line>And in the midst of this wide quietness</line>
      <line>A rosy sanctuary will I dress</line>
      <line>With the wreathed trellis of a working brain,</line>
      <line>With buds, and bells, and stars without a name –</line>
      <line>With all the gardener Fancy e’er could feign,</line>
      <line>Who, breeding flowers, will never breed the same.</line>
      <line>And there shall be for thee all soft delight</line>
      <line> That shadowy thought can win,</line>
      <line>A bright torch, and a casement ope at night,</line>
      <line>To let the warm Love in!</line>

    <title>Ode to a Nightingale</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains</line>
      <line>My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,</line>
      <line>Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains</line>
      <line>One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk.</line>
      <line> ’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,</line>
      <line>But being too happy in thine happiness –</line>
      <line>That thou, light-wingéd dryad of the trees,</line>
      <line>In some melodious plot</line>
      <line>Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,</line>
      <line>Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, for a draught of vintage that hath been</line>
      <line>Cooled a long age in the deep-delvéd earth,</line>
      <line>Tasting of Flora and the country green,</line>
      <line>Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!</line>
      <line> Oh for a beaker full of the warm South,</line>
      <line>Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,</line>
      <line>With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,</line>
      <line>And purple-stainéd mouth;</line>
      <line>That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,</line>
      <line>And with thee fade away into the forest dim –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget</line>
      <line>What thou among the leaves hast never known,</line>
      <line>The weariness, the fever, and the fret</line>
      <line>Here, where men sit and hear each other groan –</line>
      <line> Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last, grey hairs,</line>
      <line>Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;</line>
      <line>Where but to think is to be full of sorrow</line>
      <line>And leaden-eyed despairs,</line>
      <line>Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes</line>
      <line>Or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away! Away! For I will fly to thee,</line>
      <line>Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,</line>
      <line>But on the viewless wings of poesy,</line>
      <line>Though the dull brain perplexes and retards.</line>
      <line> Already with thee! Tender is the night,</line>
      <line>And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,</line>
      <line>Clustered around by all her starry fays;</line>
      <line>But here there is no light,</line>
      <line>Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown</line>
      <line>Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,</line>
      <line>Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,</line>
      <line>But, in embalméd darkness, guess each sweet</line>
      <line>Wherewith the seasonable month endows</line>
      <line> The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;</line>
      <line>White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;</line>
      <line>Fast fading violets covered up in leaves;</line>
      <line>And mid-May’s eldest child,</line>
      <line>The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,</line>
      <line>The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Darkling I listen, and for many a time</line>
      <line>I have been half in love with easeful death,</line>
      <line>Called him soft names in many a muséd rhyme,</line>
      <line>To take into the air my quiet breath.</line>
      <line> Now more than ever seems it rich to die,</line>
      <line>To cease upon the midnight with no pain,</line>
      <line>While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad</line>
      <line>In such an ecstasy!</line>
      <line>Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain –</line>
      <line>To thy high requiem become a sod.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird!</line>
      <line>No hungry generations tread thee down;</line>
      <line>The voice I hear this passing night was heard</line>
      <line>In ancient days by emperor and clown –</line>
      <line> Perhaps the self-same song that found a path</line>
      <line>Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,</line>
      <line>She stood in tears amid the alien corn;</line>
      <line>The same that oft-times hath</line>
      <line>Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam</line>
      <line>Of perilous seas, in fairy lands forlorn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Forlorn – the very word is like a bell</line>
      <line>To toll me back from thee to my sole self!</line>
      <line>Adieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well</line>
      <line>As she is famed to do, deceiving elf!</line>
      <line> Adieu! adieu! Thy plaintive anthem fades</line>
      <line>Past the near meadows, over the still stream,</line>
      <line>Up the hillside; and now ’tis buried deep</line>
      <line>In the next valley-glades:</line>
      <line>Was it a vision, or a waking dream?</line>
      <line>Fled is that music! Do I wake or sleep?</line>

      <line>Sylvan historian, who canst thus express</line>
      <line>A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme!</line>
      <line> What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape,</line>
      <line>Of deities or mortals, or of both,</line>
      <line>In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?</line>
      <line>What men or gods are these? What maidens loath?</line>

      <line>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</line>

      <line>Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,</line>
      <line>Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone.</line>
      <line> Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave</line>

      <line>Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist</line>
      <line>Wolf’s-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;</line>
      <line>Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kissed</line>
      <line>By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine.</line>
      <line> Make not your rosary of yew-berries,</line>
      <line>Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth, be</line>
      <line>Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl</line>
      <line>A partner in your sorrow’s mysteries;</line>
      <line>For shade to shade will come too drowsily,</line>
      <line>And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when the melancholy fit shall fall</line>
      <line>Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud</line>
      <line>That fosters the droop-headed flowers all</line>
      <line>And hides the green hill in an April shroud,</line>
      <line> Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,</line>
      <line>Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,</line>
      <line>Or on the wealth of globéd peonies –</line>
      <line>Or, if thy mistress some rich anger shows,</line>
      <line>Emprison her soft hand and let her rave,</line>
      <line>And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She dwells with Beauty – Beauty that must die;</line>
      <line>And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips</line>
      <line>Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure, nigh,</line>
      <line>Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips.</line>
      <line> Ay, in the very temple of Delight</line>
      <line>Veiled Melancholy has her sovran shrine,</line>
      <line>Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue</line>
      <line>Can burst Joy’s grape against his palate fine –</line>
      <line>His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,</line>

    <title>Ode on Indolence</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>One morn before me were three figures seen,</line>
      <line>With bowéd necks and joinéd hands, side-faced,</line>
      <line>And one behind the other stepped serene,</line>
      <line>In placid sandals and in white robes graced.</line>
      <line> They passed, like figures on a marble urn</line>
      <line>When shifted round to see the other side;</line>
      <line>They came again – as when the urn once more</line>
      <line>Is shifted round the first-seen shades return –</line>
      <line>And they were strange to me, as may betide</line>
      <line>With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘How is it, Shadows, that I knew ye not?</line>
      <line>How came ye muffled in so hush a masque?</line>
      <line>Was it a silent deep-disguiséd plot</line>
      <line>To steal away, and leave without a task</line>
      <line> My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour;</line>
      <line>The blissful cloud of summer-indolence</line>
      <line>Benumbed my eyes; my pulse grew less and less;</line>
      <line>Pain had no sting, and pleasure’s wreath no flower!</line>
      <line>Oh, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense</line>
      <line>Unhaunted quite of all, but – nothingness?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A third time passed they by – and, passing, turned</line>
      <line>Each one the face a moment-whiles to me –</line>
      <line>Then faded, and to follow them I burned,</line>
      <line>And ached for wings, because I knew the three.</line>
      <line> The first was a fair maid, and Love her name;</line>
      <line>The second was Ambition, pale of cheek,</line>
      <line>And ever watchful with fatiguéd eye;</line>
      <line>The last, whom I love more, the more of blame</line>
      <line>Is heaped upon her (maiden most unmeek),</line>
      <line>I knew to be my demon Poesy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They faded, and, forsooth, I wanted wings!</line>
      <line>Oh folly! What is love, and where is it? –</line>
      <line>And, for that poor ambition! It springs</line>
      <line>From a man’s little heart’s short fever-fit!</line>
      <line> For Poesy! No, she has not a joy</line>
      <line>(At least for me) so sweet as drowsy noons,</line>
      <line>And evenings steeped in honeyed indolence!</line>
      <line>Oh, for an age so sheltered from annoy,</line>
      <line>That I may never know how change the moons,</line>
      <line>Or hear the voice of busy common-sense!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And once more came they by. Alas, wherefore?</line>
      <line>My sleep had been embroidered with dim dreams;</line>
      <line>My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o’er</line>
      <line>With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams.</line>
      <line> The morn was clouded, but no shower fell,</line>
      <line>Though in her lids hung the sweet tears of May;</line>
      <line>The open casement pressed a new-leaved vine,</line>
      <line>Let in the budding warmth and throstle’s lay:</line>
      <line>‘Oh Shadows, ’twas a time to bid farewell!</line>
      <line>Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise</line>
      <line>My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass;</line>
      <line>For I would not be dieted with praise –</line>
      <line>A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce!</line>
      <line> Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more</line>
      <line>In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn.</line>
      <line>Farewell! I yet have visions for the night,</line>
      <line>And for the day faint visions there is store –</line>
      <line>Vanish, ye Phantoms, from my idle sprite</line>
      <line>Into the clouds, and never more return!’</line>

      <line>Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beside a pumice isle in Baiae’s bay,</line>

      <line>Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey with fear,</line>

      <line>If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The impulse of thy strength, only less free</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The comrade of thy wanderings over heaven,</line>

      <line>Scarce seemed a vision – I would ne’er have striven</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.</line>

      <line>One too like thee, tameless, and swift, and proud.</line>

      <line>Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is –</line>
      <line>What if my leaves are falling like its own? –</line>
      <line>The tumult of thy mighty harmonies</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Will take from both a deep autumnal tone,</line>
      <line>Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,</line>
      <line>My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Drive my dead thoughts over the universe</line>
      <line>Like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!</line>
      <line> And, by the incantation of this verse,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearth</line>
      <line>Ashes and sparks, my words among mankind!</line>
      <line>Be through my lips to unawakened earth</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The trumpet of a prophecy! Oh, Wind,</line>

    <title>Through Springtime Walks</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Through springtime walks, with flowers perfumed,</line>
      <line>I chased a wild capricious fair,</line>
      <line>Where hyacinths and jonquils bloomed,</line>
      <line>Chanting gay sonnets through the air;</line>
      <line>Hid amid a briary dell</line>
      <line> Or ’neath a hawthorn-tree,</line>
      <line>Her sweet enchantments led me on</line>
      <line>And still deluded me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While summer’s ’splendent glory smiles</line>
      <line>My ardent love in vain essayed,</line>
      <line>I strove to win her heart by wiles,</line>
      <line>But still a thousand pranks she played;</line>
      <line>Still o’er each sunburnt furzy hill,</line>
      <line>Wild, playful, gay, and free,</line>
      <line> She laughed and scorned; I chased her still,</line>
      <line>And still she bantered me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When autumn waves her golden ears</line>
      <line>And wafts o’er fruits her pregnant breath,</line>
      <line>The sprightly lark its pinions rears;</line>
      <line>I chased her o’er the daisied heath,</line>
      <line>And all around was glee –</line>
      <line>Still, wanton as the timid hart,</line>
      <line>She swiftly flew from me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now winter lights its cheerful fire,</line>
      <line> While jests with frolic mirth resound</line>
      <line>And draws the wandering beauty nigher,</line>
      <line>’Tis now too cold to rove around;</line>
      <line>The Christmas-game, the playful dance,</line>
      <line>Incline her heart to glee –</line>
      <line>Mutual we glow, and kindling love</line>
      <line>Draws every wish to me.</line>

    <title>A Thousand Torments</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A thousand torments wait on love –</line>
      <line>The sigh, the tear, the anguished groan –</line>
      <line>But he who never learnt to prove</line>
      <line>A jealous pang has nothing known!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> For jealousy, supreme of woe,</line>
      <line>Nursed by distorted fancy’s power,</line>
      <line>Can round the heart bid misery grow,</line>
      <line>Which darkens with the lingering hour,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While shadows, blanks to reason’s orb,</line>
      <line>In dread succession haunt the brain,</line>
      <line>And pangs, that every pang absorb,</line>
      <line>In wild, convulsive tumults reign.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At morn, at eve, the fever burns,</line>
      <line>While phantoms tear the aching breast;</line>
      <line> Day brings no calm, and night returns</line>
      <line>To mark no soothing hour of rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor, when the bosom’s wasted fires</line>
      <line>Are all extinct, is anguish o’er;</line>
      <line>For jealousy, that ne’er expires,</line>
      <line>Still wounds, when passion lives no more.</line>

    <title>Written on Visiting a Scene in Argyleshire</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>At the silence of twilight’s contemplative hour</line>
      <line>I have mused in a sorrowful mood</line>
      <line>On the wind-shaken reeds that embosom the bower</line>
      <line>Where the home of my forefathers stood.</line>
      <line> All ruined and wild is their roofless abode,</line>
      <line>And lonely the dark raven’s sheltering tree –</line>
      <line>And travelled by few is the grass-covered road</line>
      <line>Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trod</line>
      <line>To his hills that encircle the sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet, wandering, I found on my ruinous walk,</line>
      <line>By the dial-stone agéd and green,</line>
      <line>One rose of the wilderness left on its stalk</line>
      <line>To mark where a garden had been.</line>
      <line>Like a brotherless hermit, the last of his race,</line>
      <line> All wild in the silence of Nature it drew</line>
      <line>From each wandering sunbeam a lonely embrace –</line>
      <line>For the night-weed and thorn overshadowed the place</line>
      <line>Where the flower of my forefathers grew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sweet bud of the wilderness, emblem of all</line>
      <line>That remains in this desolate heart!</line>
      <line>The fabric of bliss to its centre may fall,</line>
      <line>But patience shall never depart</line>
      <line>Though the wilds of enchantment, all vernal and bright</line>
      <line>In the days of delusion, by fancy combined</line>
      <line> With the vanishing phantoms of love and delight,</line>
      <line>Abandon my soul like a dream of the night</line>
      <line>And leave but a desert behind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Be hushed, my dark spirit, for wisdom condemns</line>
      <line>When the faint and the feeble deplore –</line>
      <line>Be strong as the rock of the ocean, that stems</line>
      <line>A thousand wild waves on the shore!</line>
      <line>Through the perils of chance and the scowl of disdain</line>
      <line>May thy front be unaltered, thy courage elate!</line>
      <line>Yea, even the name I have worshipped in vain</line>
      <line> Shall awake not the sigh of remembrance again:</line>
      <line>To bear is to conquer our fate.</line>

    <title>Lines Written in Early Spring</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I heard a thousand blended notes</line>
      <line>While in a grove I sat reclined,</line>
      <line>In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts</line>
      <line>Bring sad thoughts to the mind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> To her fair works did Nature link</line>
      <line>The human soul that through me ran,</line>
      <line>And much it grieved my heart to think</line>
      <line>What man has made of man.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Through primrose-tufts, in that sweet bower,</line>
      <line>The periwinkle trailed its wreathes;</line>
      <line>And ’tis my faith that every flower</line>
      <line>Enjoys the air it breathes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The birds around me hopped and played,</line>
      <line>Their thoughts I cannot measure,</line>
      <line> But the least motion which they made,</line>
      <line>It seemed a thrill of pleasure.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The budding twigs spread out their fan,</line>
      <line>To catch the breezy air;</line>
      <line>And I must think – do all I can –</line>
      <line>That there was pleasure there.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If I these thoughts may not prevent,</line>
      <line>If such be of my creed the plan,</line>
      <line>Have I not reason to lament</line>
      <line>What man has made of man?</line>

    <title>Two April Mornings</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>We walked along while bright and red</line>
      <line>Uprose the morning sun,</line>
      <line>And Matthew stopped – he looked, and said</line>
      <line>‘The will of God be done!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A village schoolmaster was he</line>
      <line>With hair of glittering grey,</line>
      <line>As blithe a man as you could see</line>
      <line>On a spring holiday.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And on that morning, through the grass</line>
      <line>And by the steaming rills,</line>
      <line>We travelled merrily to pass</line>
      <line>A day among the hills.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Our work’, said I, ‘was well begun –</line>
      <line>Then, from thy breast what thought,</line>
      <line> Beneath so beautiful a sun,</line>
      <line>So sad a sigh has brought?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A second time did Matthew stop</line>
      <line>And, fixing still his eye</line>
      <line>Upon the eastern mountain-top,</line>
      <line>To me he made reply:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Yon cloud with that long purple cleft</line>
      <line>Brings fresh into my mind</line>
      <line>A day like this which I have left</line>
      <line>Full thirty years behind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And on that slope of springing corn</line>
      <line>The self-same crimson hue</line>
      <line>Fell from the sky that April morn –</line>
      <line>The same which now I view.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With rod and line my silent sport</line>
      <line>I plied by Derwent’s wave,</line>
      <line>And, coming to the church, stopped short</line>
      <line>Beside my daughter’s grave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nine summers had she scarcely seen,</line>
      <line>The pride of all the vale!</line>
      <line> And then she sang – she would have been</line>
      <line>A very nightingale!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Six feet in earth my Emma lay,</line>
      <line>And yet I loved her more</line>
      <line>(For so it seemed) than till that day</line>
      <line>I e’er had loved before.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, turning from her grave, I met</line>
      <line>Beside the churchyard-yew</line>
      <line>A blooming girl, whose hair was wet</line>
      <line>With points of morning dew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A basket on her head she bare,</line>
      <line>Her brow was smooth and white;</line>
      <line>To see a child so very fair,</line>
      <line>It was a pure delight!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No fountain from its rocky cave</line>
      <line>E’er tripped with foot so free;</line>
      <line>She seemed as happy as a wave</line>
      <line>That dances on the sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There came from me a sigh of pain</line>
      <line>Which I could ill confine;</line>
      <line> I looked at her, and looked again –</line>
      <line>And did not wish her mine.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Matthew is in his grave, yet now</line>
      <line>Methinks I see him stand,</line>
      <line>As at that moment, with his bough</line>
      <line>Of wilding in his hand.</line>

    <title>The Fountain</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>We talked with open heart, and tongue</line>
      <line>Affectionate and true –</line>
      <line>A pair of friends, though I was young,</line>
      <line>And Matthew seventy-two.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> We lay beneath a spreading oak,</line>
      <line>Beside a mossy seat,</line>
      <line>And from the turf a fountain broke</line>
      <line>And gurgled at our feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Now, Matthew, let us try to match</line>
      <line>This water’s pleasant tune</line>
      <line>With some old Border song or catch</line>
      <line>That suits a summer’s noon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or of the church-clock and the chimes</line>
      <line>Sing here beneath the shade</line>
      <line> That half-mad thing of witty rhymes</line>
      <line>Which you last April made!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In silence Matthew lay, and eyed</line>
      <line>The spring beneath the tree;</line>
      <line>And thus the dear old man replied,</line>
      <line>The grey-haired man of glee:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Down to the vale this water steers –</line>
      <line>How merrily it goes! –</line>
      <line>’Twill murmur on a thousand years,</line>
      <line>And flow as now it flows.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And here, on this delightful day,</line>
      <line>I cannot choose but think</line>
      <line>How oft, a vigorous man, I lay</line>
      <line>Beside this fountain’s brink.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My eyes are dim with childish tears,</line>
      <line>My heart is idly stirred,</line>
      <line>For the same sound is in my ears</line>
      <line>Which in those days I heard.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus fares it still in our decay;</line>
      <line>And yet the wiser mind</line>
      <line> Mourns less for what age takes away</line>
      <line>Than what it leaves behind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The blackbird in the summer trees,</line>
      <line>The lark upon the hill,</line>
      <line>Let loose their carols when they please,</line>
      <line>Are quiet when they will.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With Nature never do they wage</line>
      <line>A foolish strife; they see</line>
      <line>A happy youth, and their old age</line>
      <line>Is beautiful and free.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But we are pressed by heavy laws,</line>
      <line>And often – glad no more –</line>
      <line>We wear a face of joy, because</line>
      <line>We have been glad of yore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If there is one who need bemoan</line>
      <line>His kindred laid in earth,</line>
      <line>The household-hearts that were his own,</line>
      <line>It is the man of mirth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My days, my friend, are almost gone,</line>
      <line>My life has been approved,</line>
      <line> And many love me, but by none</line>
      <line>Am I enough beloved.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Now both himself and me he wrongs,</line>
      <line>The man who thus complains!</line>
      <line>I live and sing my idle songs</line>
      <line>Upon these happy plains –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, Matthew, for thy children dead</line>
      <line>I’ll be a son to thee!’</line>
      <line>At this he grasped his hands, and said</line>
      <line>‘Alas, that cannot be!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> We rose up from the fountain-side,</line>
      <line>And down the smooth descent</line>
      <line>Of the green sheep-track did we glide,</line>
      <line>And through the wood we went,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, ere we came to Leonard’s Rock,</line>
      <line>He sang those witty rhymes</line>
      <line>About the crazy old church-clock</line>
      <line>And the bewildered chimes.</line>

      <line>Preserve for thee, by individual right,</line>

      <line>A gem that glitters while it lives,</line>

      <line>Slips in a moment out of life.</line>

      <line>That floats on high o’er vales and hills,</line>

      <line>A host, of golden daffodils;</line>

      <line>Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</line>

      <line>The tedded hay and corn-sheaves in one field –</line>
      <line>Show summer gone, ere come. The foxglove tall</line>
      <line>Sheds its loose purple bells, or in the gust,</line>
      <line> Or when it bends beneath the up-springing lark</line>
      <line>Or mountain-finch alighting. And the rose</line>
      <line>(In vain the darling of successful love)</line>
      <line>Stands, like some boasted beauty of past years,</line>
      <line>The thorns remaining, and the flowers all gone.</line>
      <line>Nor can I find, amid my lonely walk</line>
      <line>By rivulet, or spring, or wet roadside,</line>
      <line>That blue and bright-eyed floweret of the brook,</line>
      <line>Hope’s gentle gem, the sweet forget-me-not!</line>
      <line>So will not fade the flowers which Emmeline</line>
      <line> With delicate fingers on the snow-white silk</line>
      <line>Has worked (the flowers which most she knew I loved),</line>
      <line>And, more beloved than they, her auburn hair.</line>
      <line>In the cool morning twilight, early waked</line>
      <line>By her full bosom’s joyous restlessness,</line>
      <line>Softly she rose, and lightly stole along</line>
      <line>Down the slope-coppice to the woodbine-bower,</line>
      <line>Whose rich flowers, swinging in the morning breeze,</line>
      <line>Over their dim fast-moving shadows hung,</line>
      <line>Making a quiet image of disquiet</line>
      <line> In the smooth, scarcely moving river-pool.</line>
      <line>There, in that bower where first she owned her love</line>
      <line>And let me kiss my own warm tear of joy</line>
      <line>From off her glowing cheek, she sat and stretched</line>
      <line>The silk upon the frame, and worked her name</line>
      <line>Between the moss-rose and forget-me-not –</line>
      <line>Her own dear name, with her own auburn hair! –</line>
      <line>That, forced to wander till sweet spring return,</line>
      <line>I yet might ne’er forget her smile, her look,</line>
      <line>Her voice (that even in her mirthful mood</line>
      <line> Has made me wish to steal away and weep),</line>
      <line>Nor yet the entrancement of that maiden-kiss</line>
      <line>With which she promised that, when spring returned,</line>
      <line>She would resign one half of that dear name,</line>
      <line>And own thenceforth no other name but mine!</line>

      <line>Peaceful our valley, fair and green,</line>
      <line>And beautiful her cottages,</line>
      <line>Each in its nook, its sheltered hold,</line>
      <line>Or guarded by its tuft of trees.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Many and beautiful they are,</line>
      <line>But there is one that I love best,</line>
      <line>A lowly shed in truth it is,</line>
      <line>A brother of the rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet when I sit on rock or hill,</line>
      <line>Down-looking on the valley fair,</line>
      <line>That cottage with its clustering trees</line>
      <line>Summons my heart – it settles there.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Others there are whose small domain</line>
      <line>Of fertile fields and hedgerows green</line>
      <line> Might more entice a wanderer’s mind</line>
      <line>To wish that there his home had been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such wish be his, I blame him not –</line>
      <line>My fancy is unfettered, wild –</line>
      <line>I love that house because it is</line>
      <line>The very mountains’ child!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fields hath it of its own, green fields,</line>
      <line>But they are craggy, steep and bare;</line>
      <line>Their fence is of the mountain-stone</line>
      <line>And moss and lichen flourish there.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And when the storm comes from the north</line>
      <line>It lingers near that pastoral spot,</line>
      <line>And piping through the mossy walls,</line>
      <line>It seems delighted with its lot.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And let it take its own delight,</line>
      <line>And let it range the pastures bare,</line>
      <line>Until it reach that group of trees –</line>
      <line>It may not enter there!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A green unfading grove it is,</line>
      <line>Skirted with many a lesser tree –</line>
      <line> Hazel and holly, beech and oak –</line>
      <line>A bright and flourishing company!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Precious the shelter of those trees,</line>
      <line>They screen the cottage that I love;</line>
      <line>The sunshine pierces to the roof</line>
      <line>And the tall pine-trees tower above.</line>

      <line>The cope of Heaven seems rent and cloven</line>
      <line>By the enchantment of thy strain,</line>
      <line>And o’er my shoulders wings are woven</line>
      <line>To follow its sublime career</line>
      <line>Beyond the mighty moons that wane</line>
      <line>Upon the verge of Nature’s utmost sphere,</line>
      <line>Till the world’s shadowy walls are past, and disappear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Cease, cease, for such wild lessons madmen learn!</line>
      <line> Long thus to sink, thus to be lost and die,</line>
      <line>Perhaps is death indeed – Constantia turn!</line>
      <line>Yes, in thine eyes a power like light doth lie</line>
      <line>Even though the sounds – its voice – that were</line>
      <line>Between thy lips are laid to sleep,</line>
      <line>Within thy breath and on thy hair</line>
      <line>Like odour it is lingering yet,</line>
      <line>And from thy touch like fire doth leap!</line>
      <line>Even while I write my burning cheeks are wet –</line>
      <line>Such things the heart can feel and learn, but not forget!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun is warm, the sky is clear,</line>
      <line>The waves are dancing fast and bright,</line>
      <line>Blue isles and snowy mountains wear</line>
      <line>The purple noon’s transparent might,</line>
      <line> The breath of the moist earth is light,</line>
      <line>Around its unexpanded buds;</line>
      <line>Like many a voice of one delight,</line>
      <line>The winds, the birds, the ocean floods,</line>
      <line>The City’s voice itself, is soft like solitude’s.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I see the deep’s untrampled floor</line>
      <line>With green and purple seaweeds strown;</line>
      <line>I see the waves upon the shore,</line>
      <line>Like light dissolved in star-showers, thrown;</line>
      <line>I sit upon the sands alone.</line>
      <line> The lightning of the noontide ocean</line>
      <line>Is flashing round me, and a tone</line>
      <line>Arises from its measured motion,</line>
      <line>How sweet – did any heart now share in my emotion!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas, I have nor hope, nor health,</line>
      <line>Nor peace within, nor calm around,</line>
      <line>Nor that content surpassing wealth</line>
      <line>The sage in meditation found,</line>
      <line>And walked with inward glory crowned –</line>
      <line>Nor fame, nor power, nor love, nor leisure.</line>
      <line> Others I see whom these surround,</line>
      <line>Smiling they live, and call life pleasure –</line>
      <line>To me that cup has been dealt in another measure.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet now despair itself is mild,</line>
      <line>Even as the winds and waters are;</line>
      <line>I could lie down like a tired child,</line>
      <line>And weep away the life of care</line>
      <line>Which I have borne and yet must bear,</line>
      <line>Till death like sleep might steal on me</line>
      <line>And I might feel in the warm air</line>
      <line> My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea</line>
      <line>Breathe o’er my dying brain its last monotony.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some might lament that I were cold –</line>
      <line>As I, when this sweet day is gone</line>
      <line>(Which my lost heart, too soon grown old,</line>
      <line>Insults with this untimely moan),</line>
      <line>They might lament – for I am one</line>
      <line>Whom men love not, and yet regret;</line>
      <line>Unlike this day, which, when the sun</line>
      <line>Shall on its stainless glory set,</line>
      <line> Will linger, though enjoyed, like joy in memory yet.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers</line>
      <line>From the seas and the streams,</line>
      <line>I bear light shade for the leaves when laid</line>
      <line>In their noonday dreams.</line>
      <line> From my wings are shaken the dews that waken</line>
      <line>The sweet buds every one,</line>
      <line>When rocked to rest on their Mother’s breast,</line>
      <line>As she dances about the sun.</line>
      <line>I wield the flail of the lashing hail,</line>
      <line>And whiten the green plains under,</line>
      <line>And then again I dissolve it in rain,</line>
      <line>And laugh as I pass in thunder.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I sift the snow on the mountains below,</line>
      <line>And their great pines groan aghast;</line>
      <line> And all the night ’tis my pillow white,</line>
      <line>While I sleep in the arms of the blast.</line>
      <line>Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,</line>
      <line>Lightning my pilot sits;</line>
      <line>In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,</line>
      <line>It struggles and howls at fits;</line>
      <line>Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,</line>
      <line>This pilot is guiding me,</line>
      <line>Lured by the love of the genii that move</line>
      <line>In the depths of the purple sea;</line>
      <line> Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,</line>
      <line>Over the lakes and the plains,</line>
      <line>Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,</line>
      <line>The spirit he loves remains;</line>
      <line>And I all the while bask in Heaven’s blue smile,</line>
      <line>Whilst he is dissolving in rains.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sanguine Sunrise, with his meteor-eyes,</line>
      <line>And his burning plumes outspread,</line>
      <line>Leaps on the back of my sailing rack</line>
      <line>When the morning-star shines dead –</line>
      <line> As on the jag of a mountain-crag,</line>
      <line>Which an earthquake rocks and swings,</line>
      <line>An eagle alit one moment may sit</line>
      <line>In the light of its golden wings.</line>
      <line>And when Sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,</line>
      <line>Its ardours of rest and of love,</line>
      <line>And the crimson pall of eve may fall</line>
      <line>From the depth of Heaven above,</line>
      <line>With wings folded I rest, on mine airy nest,</line>
      <line>As still as a brooding dove.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> That orbéd maiden with white fire laden,</line>
      <line>Whom mortals call the Moon,</line>
      <line>Glides glimmering o’er my fleece-like floor,</line>
      <line>By the midnight breezes strewn;</line>
      <line>And wherever the beat of her unseen feet,</line>
      <line>Which only the angels hear,</line>
      <line>May have broken the woof of my tent’s thin roof,</line>
      <line>The stars peep behind her and peer.</line>
      <line>And I laugh to see them whirl and flee,</line>
      <line>Like a swarm of golden bees,</line>
      <line> When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent,</line>
      <line>Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas,</line>
      <line>Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high,</line>
      <line>Are each paved with the moon and these.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I bind the Sun’s throne with a burning zone,</line>
      <line>And the Moon’s with a girdle of pearl;</line>
      <line>The volcanoes are dim, and the stars reel and swim,</line>
      <line>When the whirlwinds my banner unfurl.</line>
      <line>From cape to cape, with a bridge-like shape,</line>
      <line>Over a torrent sea,</line>
      <line> Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof –</line>
      <line>The mountains its columns be!</line>
      <line>The triumphal arch through which I march</line>
      <line>With hurricane, fire, and snow,</line>
      <line>When the Powers of the Air are chained to my chair,</line>
      <line>Is the million-coloured bow;</line>
      <line>The sphere-fire above its soft colours wove,</line>
      <line>While the moist Earth was laughing below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I am the daughter of Earth and Water,</line>
      <line>And the nursling of the Sky;</line>
      <line> I pass through the pores of the ocean and shores;</line>
      <line>I change, but I cannot die.</line>
      <line>For after the rain when with never a stain</line>
      <line>The pavilion of Heaven is bare,</line>
      <line>And the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams</line>
      <line>Build up the blue dome of air,</line>
      <line>I silently laugh at my own cenotaph,</line>
      <line>And out of the caverns of rain,</line>
      <line>Like a child from the womb, like a ghost from the tomb,</line>
      <line>I arise and unbuild it again.</line>

      <line>Has fled to her bower, well knowing I want</line>

      <line>The old man may sleep and the planets may wink,</line>
      <line>The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awake</line>
      <line>Full-blown, and such warmth for the morning’s take;</line>
      <line>The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace, and shall coo,</line>
      <line>While I kiss to the melody, aching all through.</line>

      <line> He knew for a truth, and he knew broken-hearted,</line>
      <line>That kiss was the last he should ever give me!</line>

      <line>Louisa, serious grown and mild,</line>
      <line>I knew you once a romping child,</line>
      <line>Obstreperous much and very wild.</line>
      <line>Then you would clamber up my knees,</line>
      <line> And strive with every art to tease,</line>
      <line>When every art of yours could please.</line>
      <line>Those things would scarce be proper now.</line>
      <line>But they are gone, I know not how,</line>
      <line>And woman’s written on your brow.</line>
      <line>O Time draws his finger o’er the scene,</line>
      <line>But I cannot forget between</line>
      <line>The thing to me you once have been:</line>
      <line>Each sportive sally, wild escape –</line>
      <line>The scoff, the banter, and the jape –</line>
      <line> And antics of my gamesome Ape.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>My heart is like the failing hearth</line>
      <line>Now by my side,</line>
      <line>One by one its bursts of flame</line>
      <line>Have burnt and died;</line>
      <line> There are none to watch the sinking blaze,</line>
      <line>And none to care,</line>
      <line>Or if it kindle into strength,</line>
      <line>Or waste in air.</line>
      <line>My fate is as yon faded wreath</line>
      <line>Of summer flowers:</line>
      <line>They’ve spent their store of fragrant health</line>
      <line>In sunny hours,</line>
      <line>Which recked them not, which heeded not</line>
      <line>When they were dead –</line>
      <line> Other flowers, unwarned by them,</line>
      <line>Will spring instead.</line>
      <line>And my own heart is as the lute</line>
      <line>I am now waking;</line>
      <line>Wound to too fine and high a pitch,</line>
      <line>They both are breaking.</line>
      <line>And of their song what memory</line>
      <line>Will stay behind?</line>
      <line>An echo, like a passing thought,</line>
      <line>Upon the wind.</line>
      <line> Silence, forgetfulness, and rust,</line>
      <line>Lute, are for thee –</line>
      <line>And such my lot – neglect, the grave,</line>
      <line>These are for me.</line>

      <line>False youth, can other charms attractive prove?</line>
      <line>Say, can Sicilian loves thy passions move,</line>
      <line>Play round thy heart and fix thy fickle eyes,</line>
      <line> While in despair the Lesbian Sappho dies?</line>
      <line>Has spring for thee a crown of poppies wove,</line>
      <line>Or dost thou languish in the Idalian grove,</line>
      <line>Whose altar kindles, fanned by lovers’ sighs?</line>
      <line>Ah, think that while on Etna’s shores you stray,</line>
      <line>A fire, more fierce than Etna’s, fills my breast;</line>
      <line>Nor deck Sicilian nymphs with garlands gay</line>
      <line>While Sappho’s brows with cypress wreaths are dressed –</line>
      <line>Let one kind word my weary woes repay,</line>
      <line>Or, in eternal slumbers bid them rest.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh thou, meek orb, that stealing o’er the dale</line>
      <line>Cheerest with thy modest beams the noon of night,</line>
      <line>On the smooth lake diffusing silvery light,</line>
      <line>Sublimely still, and beautifully pale!</line>
      <line> What can thy cool and placid eye avail,</line>
      <line>Where fierce despair absorbs the mental sight,</line>
      <line>While inbred glooms the vagrant thoughts invite</line>
      <line>To tempt the gulf where howling fiends assail?</line>
      <line>Oh Night, all nature owns thy tempered power,</line>
      <line>Thy solemn pause, thy dews, thy pensive beam;</line>
      <line>Thy sweet breath whispering in the moonlight bower</line>
      <line>While fainting flowerets kiss the wandering stream!</line>
      <line>Yet, vain is every charm, and vain the hour,</line>
      <line>That brings to madding love no soothing dream!</line>

      <line>Green winding walks, and shady pathways sweet,</line>
      <line>Oft-times would Anna seek the silent scene,</line>
      <line>Shrouding her beauties in the lone retreat.</line>
      <line> No more I hear her footsteps in the shade:</line>
      <line>Her image only in these pleasant ways</line>
      <line>Meets me self-wandering, where in happier days</line>
      <line>I held free converse with the fair-haired maid.</line>
      <line>I passed the little cottage which she loved,</line>
      <line>The cottage which did once my all contain!</line>
      <line>It spake of days which ne’er must come again –</line>
      <line>Spake to my heart, and much my heart was moved:</line>
      <line>‘Now fair befall thee, gentle maid!’ said I,</line>

      <line>Feels on his house-warm lips the thin air freeze,</line>
      <line>While in his shrugging neck the resolute blast</line>
      <line> Comes edging; and the leaves, in heaps down cast,</line>
      <line>He shuffles with his hastening foot, and sees</line>
      <line>The cold sky whitening through the wiry trees,</line>
      <line>And sighs to think his loitering noons have passed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And do I love thee less, to paint thee so?</line>
      <line>No. This the season is of beauty still,</line>
      <line>Doubled at heart; of smoke, with whirling glee</line>
      <line>Uptumbling ever from the blaze below,</line>
      <line>And home remembered most – and oh, loved hill,</line>
      <line>The second, and the last, away from thee!</line>

      <line>Comes on his mistress in an hour of sleep,</line>
      <line>And (wondering half that he can silence keep)</line>
      <line>Stands smiling o’er her through a flash of tears</line>
      <line> To see how sweet and self-same she appears,</line>
      <line>Till, at his touch, with little moving creep</line>
      <line>Of joy, she wakes from out her calmness deep,</line>
      <line>And then his heart finds voice, and dances round her ears –</line>

      <line>With earnest eyesight, scarcely crossed with pain,</line>

      <line>A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears,</line>
      <line> No hope I needed, and I knew no fears.</line>
      <line>But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep; and waking,</line>
      <line>I waked to sleep no more, at once o’ertaking</line>
      <line>The vanguard of my age, with all arrears</line>
      <line>Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man,</line>
      <line>Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey,</line>
      <line>For I have lost the race I never ran!</line>
      <line>A rathe December blights my lagging May,</line>
      <line>And still I am a child, though I be old –</line>
      <line>Time is my debtor for my years untold.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Still are the cowslips from thy bosom springing,</line>
      <line>Oh far-off, grassy dell? And dost thou see,</line>
      <line>When southern winds first wake their vernal singing,</line>
      <line>The star-gleam of the wood anemone?</line>
      <line> Doth the shy ring-dove haunt thee yet, the bee</line>
      <line>Hang on thy flowers as when I breathed farewell</line>
      <line>To their wild blooms? And, round my beechen tree,</line>
      <line>Still, in green softness, doth the moss-bank swell?</line>
      <line>Oh, strange illusion! by the fond heart wrought,</line>
      <line>Whose own warm life suffuses Nature’s.</line>
      <line>My being’s tide of many-coloured thought</line>
      <line>Hath passed from thee; and now, rich, leafy place,</line>
      <line>I paint thee oft, scarce consciously, a scene</line>
      <line>Silent, forsaken, dim, shadowed by what hath been.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Be frank with me, and I accept my lot;</line>
      <line>But deal not with me as a grieving child,</line>
      <line>Who for the loss of that which he hath not</line>
      <line>Is by a show of kindness thus beguiled!</line>
      <line> Raise not for me, from its enshrouded tomb,</line>
      <line>The ghostly likeness of a hope deceased;</line>
      <line>Nor think to cheat the darkness of my doom</line>
      <line>By wavering doubts how far thou art released.</line>
      <line>This dressing pity in the garb of love,</line>
      <line>This effort of the heart to seem the same,</line>
      <line>These sighs and lingerings (which nothing prove</line>
      <line>But that thou leavest me with a kind of shame),</line>
      <line>Remind me more, by their most vain deceit,</line>
      <line>Of the dear loss of all which thou dost counterfeit.</line>

    <title>Fair Elenor</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The bell struck one and shook the silent tower;</line>
      <line>The graves gave up their dead – fair Elenor</line>
      <line>Walked by the castle gate, and lookéd in.</line>
      <line>A hollow groan ran through the dreary vaults!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> She shrieked aloud, and sunk upon the steps</line>
      <line>On the cold stone her pale cheek. Sickly smells</line>
      <line>Of death issue as from a sepulchre,</line>
      <line>And all is silent but the sighing vaults.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Chill death withdraws his hand, and she revives!</line>
      <line>Amazed, she finds herself upon her feet,</line>
      <line>And, like a ghost, through narrow passages</line>
      <line>Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones,</line>
      <line>And grinning skulls, and corruptible death,</line>
      <line> Wrapped in his shroud; and now fancies she hears</line>
      <line>Deep sighs and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length, no fancy – but reality –</line>
      <line>Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet</line>
      <line>Of one that fled, approaches! Ellen stood</line>
      <line>Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wretch approaches, crying: ‘The deed is done!</line>
      <line>Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send.</line>
      <line>It is my life – send it to Elenor –</line>
      <line>He’s dead, and howling after me for blood!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Take this!’ he cried, and thrust into her arms</line>
      <line>A wet napkin, wrapped about – then rushed</line>
      <line>Past, howling. She received into her arms</line>
      <line>Pale death, and followed on the wings of fear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They passed swift through the outer gate. The wretch,</line>
      <line>Howling, leaped o’er the wall into the moat,</line>
      <line>Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen passed the bridge,</line>
      <line>And heard a gloomy voice cry, ‘Is it done?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As the deer wounded, Ellen flew over</line>
      <line>The pathless plain! As the arrows that fly</line>
      <line> By night, destruction flies and strikes in darkness!</line>
      <line>She fled from fear, till at her house arrived.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her maids await her. On her bed she falls –</line>
      <line>That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath pressed.</line>
      <line>‘Ah, woman’s fear!’ she cried: ‘Ah, curséd duke!</line>
      <line>Ah, my dear lord! Ah, wretched Elenor!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My lord was like a flower upon the brows</line>
      <line>Of lusty May! Ah, life as frail as a flower!</line>
      <line>Oh ghastly Death, withdraw thy cruel hand –</line>
      <line>Seekest thou that flower to deck thy horrid temples?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> My lord was like a star in the highest heaven,</line>
      <line>Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness;</line>
      <line>My lord was like the opening eyes of day,</line>
      <line>When western winds creep softly o’er the flowers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But he is darkened – like the summer’s noon,</line>
      <line>Clouded – fallen like the stately tree cut down!</line>
      <line>The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves.</line>
      <line>Oh Elenor, weak woman, filled with woe!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus having spoke, she raised up her head</line>
      <line>And saw the bloody napkin by her side,</line>
      <line> Which in her arms she brought – and now, tenfold</line>
      <line>More terrified, saw it unfold itself!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her eyes were fixed. The bloody cloth unfolds,</line>
      <line>Disclosing to her sight the murdered head</line>
      <line>Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted</line>
      <line>With gory blood. It groaned, and thus it spake:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘O Elenor, behold thy husband’s head,</line>
      <line>Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower,</line>
      <line>Was reft of life by the accurséd Duke!</line>
      <line>A hiréd villain turned my sleep to death.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘Oh Elenor, beware the curséd Duke –</line>
      <line>Oh give him not thy hand, now I am dead.</line>
      <line>He seeks thy love, who (coward in the night)</line>
      <line>Hiréd a villain to bereave my life.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffened to stone;</line>
      <line>She took the gory head up in her arms;</line>
      <line>She kisséd the pale lips; she had no tears to shed;</line>
      <line>She hugged it to her breast – and groaned her last!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Rise, winds of night! Relentless tempests rise!</line>
      <line>Rush from the troubled clouds, and o’er me roll –</line>
      <line>In this chill pause a deeper horror lies,</line>
      <line>A wilder fear appals my shuddering soul!</line>
      <line> ’Twas on this day, this hour accurst,</line>
      <line>That Nature, starting from repose,</line>
      <line>Heard the dire shrieks of murder burst –</line>
      <line>From infant innocence they rose,</line>
      <line>And shook these solemn towers!</line>
      <line>I shuddering pass that fatal room,</line>
      <line>For ages wrapped in central gloom –</line>
      <line>I shuddering pass that iron door</line>
      <line>Which Fate perchance unlocks no more:</line>
      <line>Death, smeared with blood, o’er the dark portal lowers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> How fearfully my step resounds</line>
      <line>Along these onely bounds!</line>
      <line>Spare, savage blast, the taper’s quivering fires –</line>
      <line>Deep in these gathering shades its flame expires.</line>
      <line>Ye host of Heaven! the door recedes –</line>
      <line>It mocks my grasp – what unseen hands</line>
      <line>Have burst its iron bands!</line>
      <line>No mortal force this gate unbarred</line>
      <line>(Where danger lives, which terrors guard) –</line>
      <line>Dread powers! its screaming hinges close</line>
      <line> On this dread scene of impious deeds –</line>
      <line>My feet are fixed! Dismay has bound</line>
      <line>My step on this polluted ground –</line>
      <line>But lo! the pitying moon a line of light</line>
      <line>Athwart the horrid darkness dimly throws,</line>
      <line>And from yon grated window chases night.</line>

      <line>Ye visions that before me roll,</line>
      <line>That freeze my blood, that shake my soul!</line>

      <line>Pale spectres! are ye what ye seem?</line>
      <line> They glide more near –</line>
      <line>Their forms unfold!</line>
      <line>Fixed are their eyes, on me they bend –</line>
      <line>Their glaring look is cold!</line>
      <line>And hark! I hear</line>
      <line>Sounds that the throbbing pulse of life suspend...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But whence arose yon solemn call?</line>
      <line>Yon bloody phantom waves his hand,</line>
      <line>And beckons me to deeper gloom –</line>
      <line>Rest, troubled form, I come!</line>
      <line>Some unknown power my step impels</line>
      <line>To Horror’s secret cells...</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>When chapman billies leave the street,</line>
      <line>And drouthy neebors neebors meet;</line>
      <line>As market-days are wearing late,</line>
      <line>An’ folk begin to tak the gate;</line>
      <line> While we sit bousing at the nappy,</line>
      <line>An’ getting fou and unco happy,</line>
      <line>We think na on the lang Scots miles,</line>
      <line>The mosses, waters, slaps, and styles,</line>
      <line>That lie between us and our hame,</line>
      <line>Whare sits our sulky, sullen dame,</line>
      <line>Gathering her brows like gathering storm,</line>
      <line>Nursing her wrath to keep it warm!</line>
      <line>This truth fand honest Tam o’ Shanter,</line>
      <line>As he frae Ayr ae night did canter –</line>
      <line> Auld Ayr, wham ne’er a town surpasses,</line>
      <line>For honest men and bonnie lasses.</line>
      <line>Oh Tam, hadst thou but been sae wise</line>
      <line>As taen thy ain wife Kate’s advice!</line>
      <line>She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum,</line>
      <line>A blethering, blustering, drunken blellum –</line>
      <line>That frae November till October,</line>
      <line>Ae market-day thou was nae sober;</line>
      <line>That ilka melder wi’ the miller,</line>
      <line>Thou sat as lang as thou had siller;</line>
      <line> That ev’ry naig was caed a shoe on,</line>
      <line>The smith and thee gat roaring fou on;</line>
      <line>That at the Lord’s house, even on Sunday,</line>
      <line>Thou drank wi’ Kirkton Jean till Monday.</line>
      <line>She prophesied, that, late or soon,</line>
      <line>Thou would be found deep drowned in Doon,</line>
      <line>Or catched wi’ warlocks in the mirk</line>
      <line>By Alloway’s auld, haunted kirk.</line>
      <line>Ah! gentle dames, it gars me greet</line>
      <line>To think how monie counsels sweet,</line>
      <line> How monie lengthened, sage advices</line>
      <line>The husband frae the wife despises!</line>
      <line>But to our tale! Ae market-night,</line>
      <line>Tam had got planted unco right,</line>
      <line>Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely,</line>
      <line>Wi’ reaming swats, that drank divinely</line>
      <line>And at his elbow Souter Johnie,</line>
      <line>His ancient, trusty, drouthy cronie:</line>
      <line>(Tam loved him like a very brither –</line>
      <line>They had been fou for weeks thegither).</line>
      <line> The night drave on wi’ sangs and clatter,</line>
      <line>And ay the ale was growing better!</line>
      <line>The landlady and Tam grew gracious</line>
      <line>Wi’ secret favours, sweet and precious;</line>
      <line>The Souter tauld his queerest stories;</line>
      <line>The landlord’s laugh was ready chorus;</line>
      <line>The storm without might rair and rustle,</line>
      <line>Tam did na mind the storm a whistle.</line>
      <line>Care, mad to see a man sae happy,</line>
      <line>E’en drowned himsel amang the nappy!</line>
      <line> As bees flee hame wi’ lades o’ treasure,</line>
      <line>The minutes winged their way wi’ pleasure –</line>
      <line>Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious,</line>
      <line>O’er a’ the ills o’ life victorious!</line>
      <line>But pleasures are like poppies spread –</line>
      <line>You seize the flower, its bloom is shed –</line>
      <line>Or like the snow falls in the river,</line>
      <line>A moment white, then melts for ever;</line>
      <line>Or like the borealis race,</line>
      <line>That flit ere you can point their place;</line>
      <line> Or like the rainbow’s lovely form</line>
      <line>Evanishing amid the storm.</line>
      <line>Nae man can tether time or tide –</line>
      <line>The hour approaches Tam maun ride –</line>
      <line>That hour, o’ night’s black arch the key-stane,</line>
      <line>That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in,</line>
      <line>And sic a night he taks the road in</line>
      <line>As ne’er poor sinner was abroad in.</line>
      <line>The wind blew as ’twad blawn its last;</line>
      <line>The rattling showers rose on the blast;</line>
      <line> The speedy gleams the darkness swallowed;</line>
      <line>Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellowed –</line>
      <line>That night, a child might understand,</line>
      <line>The Deil had business on his hand!</line>
      <line>Weel mounted on his grey mare Meg</line>
      <line>(Better never lifted leg)</line>
      <line>Tam skelpit on through dub and mire,</line>
      <line>Despising wind, and rain, and fire;</line>
      <line>Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet,</line>
      <line>Whiles crooning o’er some auld Scots sonnet,</line>
      <line> Whiles glow’ring round wi’ prudent cares,</line>
      <line>Lest bogles catch him unawares!</line>
      <line>Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh,</line>
      <line>Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry.</line>
      <line>By this time he was cross the ford,</line>
      <line>Whare in the snaw the chapman smoored;</line>
      <line>And past the birks and meikle stane,</line>
      <line>Whare drunken Charlie brak’s neck-bane;</line>
      <line>And through the whins, and by the cairn,</line>
      <line>Whare hunters fand the murdered bairn;</line>
      <line> And near the thorn, aboon the well,</line>
      <line>Whare Mungo’s mither hanged hersel.</line>
      <line>Before him Doon pours all his floods;</line>
      <line>The doubling storm roars through the woods;</line>
      <line>The lightning’s flash from pole to pole;</line>
      <line>Near and more near the thunders roll –</line>
      <line>When, glimmering through the groaning trees,</line>
      <line>Kirk-Alloway seemed in a bleeze:</line>
      <line>Through ilka bore the beams were glancing,</line>
      <line>And loud resounded mirth and dancing.</line>
      <line>Inspiring bold John Barleycorn,</line>
      <line>What dangers thou canst make us scorn!</line>
      <line>Wi’ tippenny, we fear nae evil;</line>
      <line>Wi’ usquabae, we’ll face the Devil!</line>
      <line>The swats sae reamed in Tammie’s noddle,</line>
      <line>Fair play, he cared na deils a boddle.</line>
      <line>But Maggie stood, right sair astonished,</line>
      <line>Till, by the heel and hand admonished,</line>
      <line>She ventured forward on the light,</line>
      <line>And, wow, Tam saw an unco sight! –</line>
      <line> Warlocks and witches in a dance –</line>
      <line>Nae cotillion, brent new frae France,</line>
      <line>But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys and reels,</line>
      <line>Put life and mettle in their heels.</line>
      <line>A winnock-bunker in the east,</line>
      <line>There sat Auld Nick, in shape o’ beast</line>
      <line>(A tousie tyke, black, grim, and large) –</line>
      <line>To gie them music was his charge.</line>
      <line>He screwed the pipes and gart them skirl,</line>
      <line>Till roof and rafters a’ did dirl.</line>
      <line> Coffins stood round, like open presses,</line>
      <line>That shawed the dead in their last dresses;</line>
      <line>And, by some devilish cantraip sleight,</line>
      <line>Each in its cauld hand held a light –</line>
      <line>By which heroic Tam was able</line>
      <line>To note upon the haly table,</line>
      <line>A murderer’s banes, in gibbet-airns;</line>
      <line>Twa span-lang, wee, unchristened bairns;</line>
      <line>A thief new-cutted frae a rape</line>
      <line>(Wi’ his last gasp his gab did gape);</line>
      <line> Five tomahawks wi’ bluid red-rusted;</line>
      <line>Five scymitars wi’ murder crusted;</line>
      <line>A garter which a babe had strangled;</line>
      <line>A knife a father’s throat had mangled,</line>
      <line>Whom his ain son o’ life bereft –</line>
      <line>The grey-hairs yet stack to the heft! –</line>
      <line>Wi’ mair of horrible and awefu’,</line>
      <line>Which even to name wad be unlawfu’.</line>
      <line>As Tammie glowred, amazed and curious,</line>
      <line>The mirth and fun grew fast and furious;</line>
      <line> The piper loud and louder blew,</line>
      <line>The dancers quick and quicker flew,</line>
      <line>They reeled, they set, they crossed, they cleekit.</line>
      <line>Till ilka carlin swat and reekit,</line>
      <line>And coost her duddies to the wark,</line>
      <line>And linket at it in her sark!</line>
      <line>Now Tam, oh Tam – had thae been queans,</line>
      <line>A’ plump and strapping in their teens –</line>

      <line>I wad hae gi’en them off my hurdies</line>
      <line>For ae blink o’ the bonnie burdies!</line>
      <line>But withered beldams, auld and droll,</line>
      <line>Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal,</line>
      <line>Louping and flinging on a crummock,</line>
      <line>I wonder did na turn thy stomach!</line>
      <line>But Tam kend what was what fu’ brawlie:</line>
      <line>There was ae winsome wench and wawlie</line>
      <line> That night enlisted in the core,</line>
      <line>Lang after kend on Carrick shore –</line>
      <line>For monie a beast to dead she shot,</line>
      <line>An’ perished monie a bonnie boat,</line>
      <line>And shook baith meikle corn and bear,</line>
      <line>And kept the country-side in fear!</line>
      <line>Her cutty sark, o’ Paisley harn,</line>
      <line>That while a lassie she had worn,</line>
      <line>In longitude though sorely scanty,</line>
      <line>It was her best, and she was vauntie.</line>
      <line> Ah, little kend thy reverend grannie,</line>
      <line>That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,</line>
      <line>Wi’ twa pund Scots (’twas a’ her riches),</line>
      <line>Wad ever graced a dance of witches!</line>
      <line>But here my Muse her wing maun cour,</line>
      <line>Sic flights are far beyond her power –</line>
      <line>To sing how Nannie lap and flang</line>
      <line>(A souple jade she was and strang),</line>
      <line>And how Tam stood like ane bewitched,</line>
      <line>And thought his very een enriched!</line>
      <line> Even Satan glowred, and fidged fu’ fain,</line>
      <line>And hotched and blew wi’ might and main;</line>
      <line>Till – first ae caper, syne anither –</line>
      <line>Tam tint his reason a’ thegither,</line>
      <line>And roars out: ’Weel done, Cutty-sark!’</line>
      <line>And in an instant all was dark;</line>
      <line>And scarcely had he Maggie rallied,</line>
      <line>When out the hellish legion sallied.</line>
      <line>As bees bizz out wi’ angry fyke,</line>
      <line>When plundering herds assail their byke;</line>
      <line> As open pussie’s mortal foes,</line>
      <line>When, pop! she starts before their nose;</line>
      <line>As eager runs the market-crowd,</line>
      <line>When ‘Catch the thief!’ resounds aloud –</line>
      <line>So Maggie runs; the witches follow,</line>
      <line>Wi’ monie an eldritch skriech and hollo!</line>
      <line>Ah, Tam! Ah, Tam! thou’ll get thy fairin –</line>
      <line>In hell they’ll roast thee like a herrin!</line>
      <line>In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin –</line>
      <line>Kate soon will be a woefu’ woman!</line>
      <line>Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg,</line>
      <line>And win the key-stane of the brig;</line>
      <line>There, at them thou thy tail may toss,</line>
      <line>A running stream they dare na cross!</line>
      <line>But ere the key-stane she could make,</line>
      <line>The fient a tail she had to shake –</line>
      <line>For Nannie, far before the rest,</line>
      <line>Hard upon noble Maggie prest,</line>
      <line>And flew at Tam wi’ furious ettle!</line>
      <line>But little wist she Maggie’s mettle –</line>
      <line> Ae spring brought off her master hale,</line>
      <line>But left behind her ain grey tail:</line>
      <line>The carlin claught her by the rump,</line>
      <line>And left poor Maggie scarce a stump!</line>
      <line>Now, wha this tale o’ truth shall read,</line>
      <line>Ilk man, and mother’s son, take heed:</line>
      <line>Whene’er to drink you are inclined,</line>
      <line>Or cutty sarks run in your mind,</line>
      <line>Think, ye may buy the joys o’er dear –</line>
      <line>Remember Tam o’ Shanter’s mare!</line>

    <title>The Lass of Fair Wone</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beside the parson’s bower of yew</line>
      <line>Why strays a troubled spright,</line>
      <line>That peaks and pines, and dimly shines</line>
      <line>Thro’ curtains of the night?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Why steals along the pond of toads</line>
      <line>A gliding fire so blue,</line>
      <line>That lights a spot where grows no grass,</line>
      <line>Where falls no rain nor dew?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The parson’s daughter once was good,</line>
      <line>And gentle as the dove,</line>
      <line>And young and fair – and many came</line>
      <line>To win the damsel’s love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>High o’er the hamlet, from the hill</line>
      <line>Beyond the winding stream,</line>
      <line> The windows of a stately house</line>
      <line>In sheen of evening gleam.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There dwelt, in riot, rout, and roar,</line>
      <line>A lord so frank and free,</line>
      <line>That oft, with inward joy of heart,</line>
      <line>The maid beheld his glee –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Whether he met the dawning day</line>
      <line>In hunting trim so fine,</line>
      <line>Or tapers, sparkling from his hall,</line>
      <line>Beshone the midnight wine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He sent the maid his picture, girt</line>
      <line>With diamond, pearl, and gold,</line>
      <line>And silken-paper, sweet with musk,</line>
      <line>This gentle message told:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Let go thy sweethearts, one and all!</line>
      <line>Shalt thou be basely woo’d,</line>
      <line>That worthy art to gain the heart</line>
      <line>Of youths of noble blood?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The tale I would to thee bewray,</line>
      <line>In secret must be said:</line>
      <line> At midnight-hour I’ll seek thy bower –</line>
      <line>Fair lass, be not afraid!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the amorous nightingale</line>
      <line>Sings sweetly to his mate,</line>
      <line>I’ll pipe my quail-call from the field –</line>
      <line>Be kind, nor make me wait.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In cap and mantle clad he came,</line>
      <line>At night, with lonely tread,</line>
      <line>Unseen, and silent as a mist,</line>
      <line>And hush’d the dogs with bread.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And when the amorous nightingale</line>
      <line>Sung sweetly to his mate,</line>
      <line>She heard his quail-call in the field,</line>
      <line>And, ah, ne’er made him wait!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The words he whisper’d were so soft</line>
      <line>They won her ear and heart –</line>
      <line>How soon will she who loves believe!</line>
      <line>How deep a lover’s art!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No lure, no soothing guise, he spar’d,</line>
      <line>To banish virtuous shame;</line>
      <line> He call’d on holy God above,</line>
      <line>As witness to his flame.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He clasp’d her to his breast, and swore</line>
      <line>To be for ever true:</line>
      <line>‘O yield thee to my wishful arms,</line>
      <line>Thy choice thou shalt not rue!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And while she strove, he drew her on,</line>
      <line>And led her to the bower,</line>
      <line>So still, so dim – and round about</line>
      <line>Sweet smelt the beans in flower.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> There beat her heart, and heav’d her breast,</line>
      <line>And pleaded every sense –</line>
      <line>And there the glowing breath of lust</line>
      <line>Did blast her innocence!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when the fragrant beans began</line>
      <line>Their sallow blooms to shed,</line>
      <line>Her sparkling eyes their lustre lost;</line>
      <line>Her cheek, its roses fled:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when she saw the pods increase,</line>
      <line>The ruddier cherries strain,</line>
      <line> She felt her silken robe grow tight,</line>
      <line>Her waist new weight sustain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the mowers went afield,</line>
      <line>The yellow corn to ted,</line>
      <line>She felt her burden stir within,</line>
      <line>And shook with tender dread.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the winds of autumn hist</line>
      <line>Along the stubble-field;</line>
      <line>Then could the damsel’s piteous plight</line>
      <line>No longer be conceal’d.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Her sire, a harsh and angry man,</line>
      <line>With furious voice revil’d:</line>
      <line>‘Hence from my sight! I’ll none of thee –</line>
      <line>I harbour not thy child!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And fast, amid her fluttering hair,</line>
      <line>With clenchéd fist he gripes,</line>
      <line>And seiz’d a leathern thong, and lash’d</line>
      <line>Her side with sounding stripes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her lily skin, so soft and white,</line>
      <line>He ribb’d with bloody wales,</line>
      <line> And thrust her out – tho’ black the night,</line>
      <line>Tho’ sleet and storm assails.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Up the harsh rock, on flinty paths,</line>
      <line>The maiden had to roam –</line>
      <line>On tottering feet she grop’d her way,</line>
      <line>And sought her lover’s home.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘A mother thou has made of me,</line>
      <line>Before thou mad’st a wife:</line>
      <line>For this, upon my tender breast,</line>
      <line>These livid stripes are rife –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Behold!’ And then, with bitter sobs,</line>
      <line>She sank upon the floor:</line>
      <line>‘Make good the evil thou has wrought –</line>
      <line>My injur’d name restore!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Poor soul! I’ll have thee hous’d and nurs’d!</line>
      <line>Thy terrors I lament,</line>
      <line>Stay here – we’ll have some further talk –</line>
      <line>The old one shall repent.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘I have no time to rest and wait –</line>
      <line>That saves not my good name –</line>
      <line> If thou with honest soul hast sworn,</line>
      <line>O leave me not to shame;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But at the holy altar be</line>
      <line>Our union sanctified:</line>
      <line>Before the people and the priest</line>
      <line>Receive me for thy bride.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Unequal matches must not blot</line>
      <line>The honours of my line –</line>
      <line>Art thou of wealth or rank for me</line>
      <line>To harbour thee as mine?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> What’s fit and fair I’ll do for thee:</line>
      <line>Shalt yet retain my love –</line>
      <line>Shalt wed my huntsman – and we’ll then</line>
      <line>Our former transports prove.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Thy wicked soul, hard-hearted man,</line>
      <line>May pangs in Hell await –</line>
      <line>Sure, if not suited for thy bride,</line>
      <line>I was not for thy mate!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Go, seek a spouse of nobler blood,</line>
      <line>Nor God’s just judgements dread!</line>
      <line> So shall, ere long, some base-born wretch</line>
      <line>Defile thy marriage-bed –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, traitor, feel how wretched they</line>
      <line>In hopeless shame immerst –</line>
      <line>Then smite thy forehead on the wall,</line>
      <line>While horrid curses burst!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Roll thy dry eyes in wild despair –</line>
      <line>Unsooth’d thy grinning woe!’</line>
      <line>Thro’ thy pale temples fire the ball,</line>
      <line>And sink to fiends below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Collected then she started up</line>
      <line>And thro’ the hissing sleet,</line>
      <line>Thro’ thorn and briar, thro’ flood and mire,</line>
      <line>She fled with bleeding feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Where now’, she cry’d, ‘my gracious God!</line>
      <line>What refuge have I left?’</line>
      <line>And reach’d the garden of her home,</line>
      <line>Of hope in man bereft.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On hand and foot she feebly crawl’d</line>
      <line>Beneath the bower unblest,</line>
      <line> Where withering leaves and gathering snow</line>
      <line>Prepar’d her only rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There rending pains and darting throes</line>
      <line>Assail’d her shuddering frame;</line>
      <line>And from her womb a lovely boy</line>
      <line>With wail and weeping came.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Forth from her hair a silver pin</line>
      <line>With hasty hand she drew,</line>
      <line>And prest against its tender heart,</line>
      <line>And the sweet babe she slew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Erst when the act of blood was done,</line>
      <line>Her soul its guilt abhorr’d:</line>
      <line>‘My Jesus! what has been my deed?</line>
      <line>Have mercy on me, Lord!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With bloody nails, beside the pond,</line>
      <line>Its shallow grave she tore:</line>
      <line>‘There rest in God – there shame and want</line>
      <line>Thou can’st not suffer more!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Me vengeance waits! My poor, poor child,</line>
      <line>Thy wound shall bleed afresh,</line>
      <line> When ravens from the gallows tear</line>
      <line>Thy mother’s mould’ring flesh!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hard by the bower her gibbet stands;</line>
      <line>Her skull is still to show –</line>
      <line>It seems to eye the barren grave,</line>
      <line>Three spans in length below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That is the spot where grows no grass,</line>
      <line>Where falls no rain nor dew,</line>
      <line>Whence steals along the pond of toads</line>
      <line>A hovering fire so blue!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And nightly, when the ravens come,</line>
      <line>Her ghost is seen to glide;</line>
      <line>Pursues and tries to quench the flame,</line>
      <line>And pines the pool beside.</line>

    <title>Alonzo the Brave and the Fair Imogine</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A warrior so bold and a virgin so bright</line>
      <line>Conversed, as they sat on the green;</line>
      <line>They gazed on each other with tender delight –</line>
      <line>Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,</line>
      <line> The maid’s was the Fair Imogine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And, oh!’ said the youth, ‘since to-morrow I go</line>
      <line>To fight in a far-distant land,</line>
      <line>Your tears for my absence soon leaving to flow,</line>
      <line>Some other will court you, and you will bestow</line>
      <line>On a wealthier suitor your hand!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh hush these suspicions’, Fair Imogine said,</line>
      <line>‘Offensive to love and to me!</line>
      <line>For, if you be living, or if you be dead,</line>
      <line>I swear by the Virgin, that none in your stead</line>
      <line> Shall husband of Imogine be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if e’er for another my heart should decide,</line>
      <line>Forgetting Alonzo the Brave,</line>
      <line>God grant that, to punish my falsehood and pride,</line>
      <line>Your ghost at the marriage may sit by my side –</line>
      <line>May tax me with perjury, claim me as bride,</line>
      <line>And bear me away to the grave!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To Palestine hastened the hero so bold,</line>
      <line>His love she lamented him sore –</line>
      <line>But scarce had a twelvemonth elapsed when, behold,</line>
      <line> A Baron all covered with jewels and gold</line>
      <line>Arrived at Fair Imogine’s door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His treasure, his presents, his spacious domain,</line>
      <line>Soon made her untrue to her vows:</line>
      <line>He dazzled her eyes, he bewildered her brain,</line>
      <line>He caught her affections so light and so vain –</line>
      <line>And carried her home as his spouse,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now had the marriage been blest by the priest;</line>
      <line>The revelry now was begun;</line>
      <line>The tables they groaned with the weight of the feast –</line>
      <line> Nor yet had the laughter and merriment ceased,</line>
      <line>When the bell of the Castle tolled one!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then first with amazement Fair Imogine found</line>
      <line>That a stranger was placed by her side:</line>
      <line>His air was terrific; he uttered no sound;</line>
      <line>He spoke not, he moved not, he looked not around,</line>
      <line>But earnestly gazed on the bride.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His vizor was closed, and gigantic his height;</line>
      <line>His armour was sable to view;</line>
      <line>All pleasure and laughter were hushed at his sight;</line>
      <line> The dogs, as they eyed him, drew back in affright;</line>
      <line>The lights in the chamber burnt blue!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His presence all bosoms appeared to dismay;</line>
      <line>The guests sat in silence and fear;</line>
      <line>At length spoke the bride, while she trembled: ‘I pray</line>
      <line>Sir Knight, that your helmet aside you would lay,</line>
      <line>And deign to partake of our cheer.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The lady is silent, the stranger complies –</line>
      <line>His vizor he slowly unclosed –</line>
      <line>Oh, then what a sight met Fair Imogine’s eyes!</line>
      <line> What words can express her dismay and surprise</line>
      <line>When a skeleton’s head was exposed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All present then uttered a terrified shout –</line>
      <line>All turned with disgust from the scene –</line>
      <line>The worms they crept in, and the worms they crept out,</line>
      <line>And sported his eyes and his temples about,</line>
      <line>While the spectre addressed Imogine:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Behold me, thou false one! Behold me!’ he cried,</line>
      <line>‘Remember Alonzo the Brave!</line>
      <line>God grants that, to punish thy falsehood and pride,</line>
      <line> My ghost at thy marriage should sit by thy side –</line>
      <line>Should tax thee with perjury, claim thee as bride,</line>
      <line>And bear thee away to the grave!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus saying, his arms round the lady he wound,</line>
      <line>While loudly she shrieked in dismay,</line>
      <line>Then sank with his prey through the wide-yawning ground –</line>
      <line>Nor ever again was Fair Imogine found,</line>
      <line>Or the spectre who bore her away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not long lived the Baron, and none since that time</line>
      <line>To inhabit the Castle presume;</line>
      <line> For chronicles tell that, by order sublime,</line>
      <line>There Imogine suffers the pain of her crime,</line>
      <line>And mourns her deplorable doom.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At midnight four times in each year does her sprite,</line>
      <line>When mortals in slumber are bound,</line>
      <line>Arrayed in her bridal apparel of white,</line>
      <line>Appear in the hall with that skeleton-knight,</line>
      <line>And shriek as he whirls her around.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While they drink out of skulls newly torn from the grave,</line>
      <line>Dancing round them pale spectres are seen!</line>
      <line> Their liquor is blood, and this horrible stave</line>
      <line>They howl: ‘To the health of Alonzo the Brave,</line>
      <line>And his consort, the False Imogine!’</line>

    <title>The Thorn</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘There is a thorn, it looks so old</line>
      <line>In truth you’d find it hard to say</line>
      <line>How it could ever have been young,</line>
      <line>It looks so old and grey.</line>
      <line> Not higher than a two years’ child</line>
      <line>It stands erect, this agéd thorn.</line>
      <line>No leaves it has, no thorny points;</line>
      <line>It is a mass of knotted joints,</line>
      <line>A wretched thing forlorn.</line>
      <line>It stands erect, and like a stone</line>
      <line>With lichens it is overgrown.</line>
      <line>Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown</line>
      <line>With lichens to the very top,</line>
      <line>And hung with heavy tufts of moss,</line>
      <line> A melancholy crop.</line>
      <line>Up from the earth these mosses creep,</line>
      <line>And this poor thorn they clasp it round</line>
      <line>So close you’d say that they were bent</line>
      <line>With plain and manifest intent</line>
      <line>To drag it to the ground,</line>
      <line>And all had joined in one endeavour</line>
      <line>To bury this poor thorn for ever.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>High on a mountain’s highest ridge</line>
      <line>(Where oft the stormy winter gale</line>
      <line> Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds</line>
      <line>It sweeps from vale to vale),</line>
      <line>Not five yards from the mountain-path</line>
      <line>This thorn you on your left espy;</line>
      <line>And to the left, three yards beyond,</line>
      <line>You see a little muddy pond</line>
      <line>Of water, never dry.</line>
      <line>I’ve measured it from side to side:</line>
      <line>’Tis three feet long and two feet wide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And close beside this agéd thorn</line>
      <line> There is a fresh and lovely sight</line>
      <line>A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,</line>
      <line>Just half a foot in height.</line>
      <line>All lovely colours there you see,</line>
      <line>All colours that were ever seen,</line>
      <line>And mossy network too is there,</line>
      <line>As if by hand of lady fair</line>
      <line>The work had woven been –</line>
      <line>And cups, the darlings of the eye,</line>
      <line>So deep is their vermilion dye.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Ah me, what lovely tints are there</line>
      <line>Of olive-green and scarlet bright,</line>
      <line>In spikes, in branches, and in stars,</line>
      <line>Green, red, and pearly white!</line>
      <line>This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss,</line>
      <line>Which close beside the thorn you see</line>
      <line>So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,</line>
      <line>Is like an infant’s grave in size –</line>
      <line>As like as like can be –</line>
      <line>But never, never, anywhere</line>
      <line> An infant’s grave was half so fair!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now would you see this agéd thorn,</line>
      <line>This pond and beauteous hill of moss,</line>
      <line>You must take care and choose your time</line>
      <line>The mountain when to cross.</line>
      <line>For oft there sits, between the heap</line>
      <line>That’s like an infant’s grave in size</line>
      <line>And that same pond of which I spoke,</line>
      <line>A woman in a scarlet cloak,</line>
      <line>And to herself she cries,</line>
      <line> “Oh misery! Oh misery!</line>
      <line>Oh woe is me, oh misery!”</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At all times of the day and night</line>
      <line>This wretched woman thither goes,</line>
      <line>And she is known to every star,</line>
      <line>And every wind that blows.</line>
      <line>And there beside the thorn she sits</line>
      <line>When the blue daylight’s in the skies,</line>
      <line>And when the whirlwind’s on the hill,</line>
      <line>Or frosty air is keen and still,</line>
      <line> And to herself she cries,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘Now wherefore thus, by day and night,</line>
      <line>In rain, in tempest, and in snow,</line>
      <line>Thus to the dreary mountain-top</line>
      <line>Does this poor woman go?</line>
      <line>And why sits she beside the thorn</line>
      <line>When the blue daylight’s in the sky,</line>
      <line>Or when the whirlwind’s on the hill,</line>
      <line> Or frosty air is keen and still,</line>

      <line>I’ll tell you everything I know –</line>

      <line>Which is a little step beyond,</line>
      <line>I wish that you would go:</line>

      <line>You something of her tale may trace.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I’ll give you the best help I can:</line>
      <line>Before you up the mountain go,</line>
      <line>Up to the dreary mountain-top,</line>
      <line>I’ll tell you all I know.</line>
      <line> ’Tis now some two-and-twenty years</line>
      <line>Since she (her name is Martha Ray)</line>
      <line>Gave with a maiden’s true good will</line>
      <line>Her company to Stephen Hill,</line>
      <line>And she was blithe and gay –</line>
      <line>And she was happy, happy still</line>
      <line>Whene’er she thought of Stephen Hill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And they had fixed the wedding-day –</line>
      <line>The morning that must wed them both –</line>
      <line>But Stephen to another maid</line>
      <line> Had sworn another oath,</line>
      <line>And with this other maid to church</line>
      <line>Unthinking Stephen went.</line>
      <line>Poor Martha, on that woeful day</line>
      <line>A cruel, cruel fire, they say,</line>
      <line>Into her bones was sent –</line>
      <line>It dried her body like a cinder,</line>
      <line>And almost turned her brain to tinder!</line>
      <line>They say, full six months after this,</line>
      <line>While yet the summer-leaves were green,</line>
      <line> She to the mountain-top would go,</line>
      <line>And there was often seen.</line>
      <line>’Tis said a child was in her womb,</line>
      <line>As now to any eye was plain:</line>
      <line>She was with child and she was mad –</line>
      <line>Yet often she was sober sad</line>
      <line>From her exceeding pain.</line>
      <line>Oh me, ten thousand times I’d rather</line>
      <line>That he had died, that cruel father!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sad case for such a brain to hold</line>
      <line> Communion with a stirring child –</line>
      <line>Sad case, as you may think, for one</line>
      <line>Who had a brain so wild!</line>
      <line>Last Christmas when we talked of this,</line>
      <line>Old Farmer Simpson did maintain</line>
      <line>That in her womb the infant wrought</line>
      <line>About its mother’s heart, and brought</line>
      <line>Her senses back again;</line>
      <line>And when at last her time drew near,</line>
      <line>Her looks were calm, her senses clear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> No more I know, I wish I did,</line>
      <line>And I would tell it all to you –</line>
      <line>For what became of this poor child</line>
      <line>There’s none that ever knew;</line>
      <line>And if a child was born or no,</line>
      <line>There’s no one that could ever tell;</line>
      <line>And if’twas born alive or dead,</line>
      <line>There’s no one knows, as I have said –</line>
      <line>But some remember well</line>
      <line>That Martha Ray about this time</line>
      <line> Would up the mountain often climb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And all that winter, when at night</line>
      <line>The wind blew from the mountain-peak,</line>
      <line>’Twas worth your while, though in the dark,</line>
      <line>The churchyard-path to seek;</line>
      <line>For many a time and oft were heard</line>
      <line>Cries coming from the mountain-head.</line>
      <line>Some plainly living voices were,</line>
      <line>And others (I’ve heard many swear)</line>
      <line>Were voices of the dead –</line>
      <line> I cannot think, whate’er they say,</line>
      <line>They had to do with Martha Ray.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But that she goes to this old thorn,</line>
      <line>The thorn which I’ve described to you,</line>
      <line>And there sits in a scarlet cloak,</line>
      <line>I will be sworn is true.</line>
      <line>For one day with my telescope,</line>
      <line>To view the ocean wide and bright</line>
      <line>(When to this country first I came,</line>
      <line>Ere I had heard of Martha’s name),</line>
      <line> I climbed the mountain’s height;</line>
      <line>A storm came on, and I could see</line>
      <line>No object higher than my knee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain!</line>
      <line>No screen, no fence, could I discover –</line>
      <line>And then the wind, in faith it was</line>
      <line>A wind full ten times over!</line>
      <line>I looked around, I thought I saw</line>
      <line>A jutting crag, and off I ran</line>
      <line>Head-foremost through the driving rain</line>
      <line> The shelter of the crag to gain,</line>
      <line>And, as I am a man,</line>
      <line>Instead of jutting crag I found</line>
      <line>A woman seated on the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I did not speak – I saw her face –</line>
      <line>Her face it was enough for me!</line>
      <line>I turned about and heard her cry,</line>
      <line>“Oh misery! Oh misery!”</line>
      <line>And there she sits, until the moon</line>
      <line>Through half the clear blue sky will go;</line>
      <line>And when the little breezes make</line>
      <line>The waters of the pond to shake</line>
      <line>(As all the country know),</line>
      <line>She shudders, and you hear her cry,</line>
      <line>“Oh misery! Oh misery!”’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘But what’s the thorn, and what’s the pond,</line>
      <line>And what’s the hill of moss to her?</line>
      <line>And what’s the creeping breeze that comes</line>
      <line>The little pond to stir?’</line>
      <line>‘I cannot tell, but some will say</line>
      <line> She hanged her baby on the tree;</line>
      <line>Some say she drowned it in the pond,</line>
      <line>Which is a little step beyond;</line>
      <line>But all and each agree</line>
      <line>The little babe was buried there,</line>
      <line>Beneath that hill of moss so fair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ve heard the scarlet moss is red</line>
      <line>With drops of that poor infant’s blood –</line>
      <line>But kill a new-born infant thus,</line>
      <line>I do not think she could!</line>
      <line> Some say, if to the pond you go</line>
      <line>And fix on it a steady view,</line>
      <line>The shadow of a babe you trace,</line>
      <line>A baby and a baby’s face,</line>
      <line>And that it looks at you –</line>
      <line>Whene’er you look on it, ’tis plain</line>
      <line>The baby looks at you again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And some had sworn an oath that she</line>
      <line>Should be to public justice brought;</line>
      <line>And for the little infant’s bones</line>
      <line> With spades they would have sought.</line>
      <line>But then the beauteous hill of moss</line>
      <line>Before their eyes began to stir,</line>
      <line>And for full fifty yards around</line>
      <line>The grass it shook upon the ground –</line>
      <line>But all do still aver</line>
      <line>The little babe is buried there,</line>
      <line>Beneath that hill of moss so fair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I cannot tell how this may be,</line>
      <line>But plain it is the thorn is bound</line>
      <line> With heavy tufts of moss that strive</line>
      <line>To drag it to the ground.</line>
      <line>And this I know, full many a time</line>
      <line>When she was on the mountain high,</line>
      <line>By day, and in the silent night</line>
      <line>When all the stars shone clear and bright,</line>
      <line>That I have heard her cry,</line>
      <line>“Oh misery! Oh misery!</line>
      <line>Oh woe is me, oh misery!”’</line>

      <line>’Tis the middle of night by the Castle-clock,</line>
      <line>And the owls have awakened the crowing cock:</line>
      <line>Tu-whit! Tu-whoo!</line>
      <line>And hark, again! the crowing cock,</line>
      <line> How drowsily it crew.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,</line>
      <line>Hath a toothless mastiff bitch;</line>
      <line>From her kennel beneath the rock</line>
      <line>She makes answer to the clock,</line>
      <line>Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour –</line>
      <line>Ever and aye, moonshine or shower,</line>
      <line>Sixteen short howls, not over loud</line>
      <line>(Some say, she sees my Lady’s shroud).</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Is the night chilly and dark?</line>
      <line> The night is chilly, but not dark.</line>
      <line>The thin grey cloud is spread on high –</line>
      <line>It covers but not hides the sky.</line>
      <line>The moon is behind, and at the full,</line>
      <line>And yet she looks both small and dull.</line>
      <line>The night is chill, the cloud is grey –</line>
      <line>’Tis a month before the month of May,</line>
      <line>And the spring comes slowly up this way.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The lovely lady, Christabel,</line>
      <line>Whom her father loves so well,</line>
      <line> What makes her in the wood so late,</line>
      <line>A furlong from the Castle-gate?</line>
      <line>She had dreams all yesternight</line>
      <line>Of her own betrothéd knight –</line>
      <line>Dreams that made her moan and leap</line>
      <line>As on her bed she lay in sleep –</line>
      <line>And she in the midnight-wood will pray</line>
      <line>For the weal of her lover that’s far away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She stole along, she nothing spoke,</line>
      <line>The breezes they were still also,</line>
      <line>And naught was green upon the oak</line>
      <line>But moss and rarest mistletoe;</line>
      <line> She kneels beneath the huge oak-tree,</line>
      <line>And in silence prayeth she.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The lady leaps up suddenly,</line>
      <line>The lovely lady, Christabel!</line>
      <line>It moaned as near, as near can be,</line>
      <line>But what it is she cannot tell –</line>
      <line>On the other side it seems to be,</line>
      <line>Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak-tree!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The night is chill; the forest bare;</line>
      <line>Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?</line>
      <line> There is not wind enough in the air</line>
      <line>To move away the ringlet-curl</line>
      <line>From the lovely lady’s cheek –</line>
      <line>There is not wind enough to twirl</line>
      <line>The one red leaf, the last of its clan,</line>
      <line>That dances as often as dance it can,</line>
      <line>Hanging so light, and hanging so high,</line>
      <line>On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hush, beating heart of Christabel –</line>
      <line>Jesu, Maria, shield her well!</line>
      <line> She folded her arms beneath her cloak,</line>
      <line>And stole to the other side of the oak.</line>
      <line>What sees she there?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There she sees a damsel bright,</line>
      <line>Drest in a silken robe of white;</line>
      <line>Her neck, her feet, her arms, bare,</line>
      <line>And the jewels disordered in her hair.</line>
      <line>I guess, ’twas frightful there to see</line>
      <line>A lady so richly clad as she –</line>
      <line>Beautiful exceedingly!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘Mary mother, save me now!’</line>
      <line>Said Christabel, ‘and who art thou?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The lady strange made answer meet,</line>
      <line>And her voice was faint and sweet:</line>
      <line>‘Have pity on my sore distress –</line>
      <line>I scarce can speak for weariness –</line>
      <line>Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!’</line>
      <line>Said Christabel, ‘How camest thou here?’</line>
      <line>And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,</line>
      <line>Did thus pursue her answer meet:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘My sire is of a noble line,</line>
      <line>And my name is Geraldine;</line>
      <line>Five warriors seized me yestermorn,</line>
      <line>Me, even me, a maid forlorn –</line>
      <line>They choked my cries with force and fright,</line>
      <line>And tied me on a palfrey white.</line>
      <line>The palfrey was as fleet as wind,</line>
      <line>And they rode furiously behind.</line>
      <line>They spurred amain, their steeds were white –</line>
      <line>And once we crossed the shade of night.</line>
      <line> As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,</line>
      <line>I have no thought what men they be;</line>
      <line>Nor do I know how long it is</line>
      <line>(For I have lain in fits, I wis)</line>
      <line>Since one, the tallest of the five,</line>
      <line>Took me from the palfrey’s back,</line>
      <line>A weary woman, scarce alive.</line>
      <line>Some muttered words his comrades spoke:</line>
      <line>He placed me underneath this oak,</line>
      <line>He swore they would return with haste –</line>
      <line> Whither they went I cannot tell.</line>
      <line>I thought I heard, some minutes past,</line>
      <line>Sounds as of a castle-bell.</line>
      <line>Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she),</line>
      <line>And help a wretched maid to flee.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then Christabel stretched forth her hand,</line>
      <line>And comforted fair Geraldine,</line>
      <line>Saying that she should command</line>
      <line>The service of Sir Leoline,</line>
      <line>And straight be convoyed, free from thrall,</line>
      <line>Back to her noble father’s hall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So up she rose, and forth they passed</line>
      <line>With hurrying steps, yet nothing fast.</line>
      <line>Her lucky stars the lady blest,</line>
      <line>And Christabel she sweetly said:</line>
      <line>‘All our household are at rest,</line>
      <line>Each one sleeping in his bed;</line>
      <line>Sir Leoline is weak in health,</line>
      <line>And may not well awakened be,</line>
      <line>So to my room we’ll creep in stealth,</line>
      <line> And you tonight must sleep with me.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They crossed the moat, and Christabel</line>
      <line>Took the key that fitted well;</line>
      <line>A little door she opened straight,</line>
      <line>All in the middle of the gate –</line>
      <line>The gate that was ironed within and without,</line>
      <line>Where an army in battle-array had marched out.</line>
      <line>The lady sank, belike through pain,</line>
      <line>And Christabel with might and main</line>
      <line>Lifted her up, a weary weight,</line>
      <line> Over the threshold of the gate –</line>
      <line>Then the lady rose again,</line>
      <line>And moved as she were not in pain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So free from danger, free from fear,</line>
      <line>They crossed the court – right glad they were!</line>
      <line>And Christabel devoutly cried</line>
      <line>To the lady by her side,</line>
      <line>‘Praise we the Virgin all divine</line>
      <line>Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!’</line>
      <line>‘Alas, alas!’ said Geraldine,</line>
      <line> ‘I cannot speak for weariness.’</line>
      <line>So free from danger, free from fear,</line>
      <line>They crossed the court – right glad they were!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Outside her kennel, the mastiff old</line>
      <line>Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold.</line>
      <line>The mastiff old did not awake,</line>
      <line>Yet she an angry moan did make!</line>
      <line>And what can ail the mastiff bitch?</line>
      <line>Never till now she uttered yell</line>
      <line>Beneath the eye of Christabel –</line>
      <line> Perhaps it is the owlet’s scritch,</line>
      <line>For what can ail the mastiff bitch?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They passed the hall, that echoes still,</line>
      <line>Pass as lightly as you will!</line>
      <line>The brands were flat, the brands were dying,</line>
      <line>Amid their own white ashes lying;</line>
      <line>But when the lady passed there came</line>
      <line>A tongue of light, a fit of flame,</line>
      <line>And Christabel saw the lady’s eye –</line>
      <line>And nothing else saw she thereby,</line>
      <line> Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,</line>
      <line>Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.</line>
      <line>‘Oh softly tread’, said Christabel,</line>
      <line>‘My father seldom sleepeth well.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sweet Christabel her feet she bares,</line>
      <line>And they are creeping up the stairs</line>
      <line>(Now in glimmer, and now in gloom),</line>
      <line>And now they pass the Baron’s room,</line>
      <line>As still as death, with stifled breath!</line>
      <line>And now have reached her chamber-door,</line>
      <line> And now with eager feet press down</line>
      <line>The rushes of her chamber-floor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The moon shines dim in the open air,</line>
      <line>And not a moonbeam enters here;</line>
      <line>But they without its light can see</line>
      <line>The chamber carved so curiously –</line>
      <line>Carved with figures strange and sweet,</line>
      <line>All made out of the carver’s brain,</line>
      <line>For a lady’s chamber meet:</line>
      <line>The lamp with twofold silver chain</line>
      <line> Is fastened to an angel’s feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The silver lamp burns dead and dim;</line>
      <line>But Christabel the lamp will trim –</line>
      <line>She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,</line>
      <line>And left it swinging to and fro,</line>
      <line>While Geraldine, in wretched plight,</line>
      <line>Sank down upon the floor below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh weary lady, Geraldine,</line>
      <line>I pray you, drink this cordial wine!</line>
      <line>It is a wine of virtuous powers –</line>
      <line> My mother made it of wild flowers.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And will your mother pity me,</line>
      <line>Who am a maiden most forlorn?’</line>
      <line>Christabel answered: ‘Woe is me!</line>
      <line>She died the hour that I was born.</line>
      <line>I have heard the gray-haired friar tell</line>
      <line>How on her deathbed she did say</line>
      <line>That she should hear the Castle-bell</line>
      <line>Strike twelve upon my wedding-day –</line>
      <line>Oh mother dear, that thou wert here!’</line>
      <line> ‘I would’, said Geraldine, ‘she were!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But soon with altered voice, said she,</line>
      <line>’Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!</line>
      <line>I have power to bid thee flee.’</line>
      <line>Alas, what ails poor Geraldine?</line>
      <line>Why stares she with unsettled eye?</line>
      <line>Can she the bodiless dead espy?</line>
      <line>And why with hollow voice cries she,</line>
      <line>’Off, woman, off! This hour is mine –</line>
      <line>Though thou her guardian spirit be,</line>
      <line>Off, woman, off! – ’tis given to me.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then Christabel knelt by the lady’s side,</line>
      <line>And raised to Heaven her eyes so blue –</line>
      <line>‘Alas!’ said she, ‘this ghastly ride,</line>
      <line>Dear lady, it hath wildered you!’</line>
      <line>The lady wiped her moist cold brow,</line>
      <line>And faintly said, ‘’Tis over now!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Again the wild-flower wine she drank:</line>
      <line>Her fair large eyes ’gan glitter bright,</line>
      <line>And from the floor whereon she sank</line>
      <line> The lofty lady stood upright –</line>
      <line>She was most beautiful to see,</line>
      <line>Like a lady of a far countree!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus the lofty lady spake –</line>
      <line>‘All they who live in the upper sky,</line>
      <line>Do love you, holy Christabel!</line>
      <line>And you love them, and for their sake</line>
      <line>And for the good which me befel,</line>
      <line>Even I in my degree will try,</line>
      <line>Fair maiden, to requite you well.</line>
      <line> But now unrobe yourself, for I</line>
      <line>Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.’</line>
      <line>Quoth Christabel, ‘So let it be!</line>
      <line>And as the lady bade, did she.</line>
      <line>Her gentle limbs did she undress,</line>
      <line>And lay down in her loveliness.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But through her brain, of weal and woe</line>
      <line>So many thoughts moved to and fro</line>
      <line>That vain it were her lids to close;</line>
      <line>So half-way from the bed she rose,</line>
      <line> And on her elbow did recline</line>
      <line>To look at the lady Geraldine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,</line>
      <line>And slowly rolled her eyes around;</line>
      <line>Then, drawing in her breath aloud</line>
      <line>Like one that shuddered, she unbound</line>
      <line>The cincture from beneath her breast.</line>
      <line>Her silken robe and inner vest</line>
      <line>Dropt to her feet, and, full in view,</line>
      <line>Behold her bosom and half her side –</line>
      <line> A sight to dream of, not to tell!</line>
      <line>And she is to sleep with Christabel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;</line>
      <line>Ah! what a stricken look was hers!</line>
      <line>Deep from within she seems half-way</line>
      <line>To lift some weight with sick assay,</line>
      <line>And eyes the maid and seeks delay –</line>
      <line>Then suddenly, as one defied,</line>
      <line>Collects herself in scorn and pride,</line>
      <line>And lay down by the maiden’s side!</line>
      <line>And in her arms the maid she took,</line>
      <line>Ah wel-a-day!</line>
      <line>And with low voice and doleful look</line>
      <line>These words did say:</line>
      <line>‘In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,</line>
      <line>Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!</line>
      <line> Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,</line>
      <line>This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;</line>
      <line>But vainly thou warrest,</line>
      <line>For this is alone in</line>
      <line>Thy power to declare,</line>
      <line>That in the dim forest</line>
      <line>Thou heardst a low moaning,</line>
      <line>And foundst a bright lady, surpassingly fair;</line>
      <line>And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,</line>
      <line>To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.’</line>

    <title>The Old Woman of Berkeley</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The raven croaked as she sat at her meal</line>
      <line>And the Old Woman knew what she said,</line>
      <line>And she grew pale at the raven’s tale</line>
      <line>And sickened and went to her bed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘Now fetch me my children, and fetch them with speed’,</line>
      <line>The Old Woman of Berkeley said –</line>
      <line>‘The Monk, my son, and my daughter the Nun,</line>
      <line>Bid them hasten, or I shall be dead.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Monk, her son, and her daughter the Nun</line>
      <line>Their way to Berkeley went,</line>
      <line>And they have brought, with pious thought,</line>
      <line>The holy sacrament.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Old Woman shrieked as they entered the door,</line>
      <line>And she cried with a voice of despair:</line>
      <line> ‘Now take away the sacrament,</line>
      <line>For its presence I cannot bear!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her lip it trembled with agony,</line>
      <line>The sweat ran down her brow:</line>
      <line>‘I have tortures in store for evermore,</line>
      <line>But spare me, my children, now!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away they sent the sacrament,</line>
      <line>The fit it left her weak,</line>
      <line>She looked at her children with ghastly eyes</line>
      <line>And faintly struggled to speak:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ‘All kinds of sin I have rioted in,</line>
      <line>And the Judgment now must be –</line>
      <line>But I secured my children’s souls,</line>
      <line>Oh, pray, my children, for me!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have ’nointed myself with infants’ fat –</line>
      <line>The fiends have been my slaves –</line>
      <line>From sleeping babes I have sucked the breath,</line>
      <line>And, breaking by charms the sleep of death,</line>
      <line>I have called the dead from their graves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the Devil will fetch me now in fire,</line>
      <line> My witchcrafts to atone;</line>
      <line>And I who have troubled the dead man’s grave</line>
      <line>Shall never have rest in my own.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Bless, I entreat, my winding-sheet,</line>
      <line>My children, I beg of you;</line>
      <line>And with holy water sprinkle my shroud –</line>
      <line>And sprinkle my coffin too!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And let me be chained in my coffin of stone,</line>
      <line>And fasten it strong, I implore,</line>
      <line>With iron bars – and with three chains</line>
      <line> Chain it to the church-floor!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And bless the chains, and sprinkle them,</line>
      <line>And let fifty priests stand round,</line>
      <line>Who night and day the mass may say</line>
      <line>When I lie on the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And see that fifty choristers</line>
      <line>Beside the bier attend me,</line>
      <line>And day and night by the taper’s light</line>
      <line>With holy hymns defend me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let the church-bells all, both great and small,</line>
      <line> Be tolled by night and day,</line>
      <line>To drive from thence the fiends who come</line>
      <line>To bear my body away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And ever have the church-door barred,</line>
      <line>After the Evensong –</line>
      <line>And I beseech you, children dear,</line>
      <line>Let the bars and bolts be strong.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And let this be three days and nights,</line>
      <line>My wretched corpse to save –</line>
      <line>Till the fourth morning keep me safe,</line>
      <line> And then I may rest in my grave.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Old Woman of Berkeley laid her down,</line>
      <line>And her eyes grew deadly dim;</line>
      <line>Short came her breath, and the struggle of death</line>
      <line>Did loosen every limb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They blessed the Old Woman’s winding-sheet</line>
      <line>With rites and prayers due;</line>
      <line>With holy water they sprinkled her shroud,</line>
      <line>And they sprinkled her coffin too.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And they chained her in her coffin of stone,</line>
      <line> And with iron barred it down,</line>
      <line>And in the church with three strong chains</line>
      <line>They chained it to the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And they blessed the chains and sprinkled them,</line>
      <line>And fifty priests stood round</line>
      <line>By night and day the mass to say</line>
      <line>Where she lay on the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And fifty sacred choristers</line>
      <line>Beside the bier attend her,</line>
      <line>Who day and night, by tapers’ light,</line>
      <line> Should with holy hymns defend her.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To see the priests and choristers</line>
      <line>It was a goodly sight,</line>
      <line>Each holding (as it were a staff)</line>
      <line>A taper burning bright.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the church-bells all, both loud and small,</line>
      <line>Did toll so loud and long;</line>
      <line>And they have barred the church-door hard,</line>
      <line>After the Evensong.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the first night, the tapers’ light</line>
      <line> Burnt steadily and clear;</line>
      <line>But they, without, an hideous rout</line>
      <line>Of angry fiends could hear –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A hideous roar at the church-door</line>
      <line>Like a long thunder-peal –</line>
      <line>And the priests they prayed, and the choristers sung,</line>
      <line>Louder in fearful zeal!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Loud tolled the bell, the priests prayed well,</line>
      <line>The tapers they burnt bright;</line>
      <line>The Monk her son, and her daughter the Nun,</line>
      <line>They told their beads all night.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The cock he crew, the fiends they flew</line>
      <line>From the voice of the morning away;</line>
      <line>Then undisturbed the choristers sing,</line>
      <line>And the fifty priests they pray:</line>
      <line>As they had sung and prayed all night,</line>
      <line>They prayed and sung all day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The second night the taper’s light</line>
      <line>Burnt dismally and blue,</line>
      <line>And everyone saw his neighbour’s face</line>
      <line> Like a dead man’s face to view.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And yells and cries, without, arise</line>
      <line>That the stoutest heart might shock,</line>
      <line>And a deafening roaring, like a cataract pouring</line>
      <line>Over a mountain-rock.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Monk and Nun they told their beads</line>
      <line>As fast as they could tell,</line>
      <line>And aye as louder grew the noise</line>
      <line>The faster went the bell!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Louder and louder the choristers sung</line>
      <line> As they trembled more and more;</line>
      <line>And the priests, as they prayed to Heaven for aid,</line>
      <line>They smote their breasts full sore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The cock he crew, the fiends they flew</line>
      <line>From the voice of the morning away;</line>
      <line>Then undisturbed the choristers sing,</line>
      <line>And the fifty priests they pray:</line>
      <line>As they had sung and prayed all night,</line>
      <line>They prayed and sung all day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The third night came, and the tapers’ flame</line>
      <line> A frightful stench did make,</line>
      <line>And they burnt as though they had been dipped</line>
      <line>In the burning brimstone lake!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the loud commotion, like the rushing of ocean,</line>
      <line>Grew momently more and more;</line>
      <line>And strokes as of a battering-ram</line>
      <line>Did shake the strong church-door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The bellmen, they for very fear</line>
      <line>Could toll the bell no longer;</line>
      <line>And still as louder grew the strokes,</line>
      <line> Their fear it grew the stronger.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Monk and Nun forgot their beads –</line>
      <line>They fell on the ground in dismay –</line>
      <line>There was not a single saint in Heaven</line>
      <line>To whom they did not pray!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the choristers’ song, which late was so strong,</line>
      <line>Faltered with consternation,</line>
      <line>For the church did rock as an earthquake-shock</line>
      <line>Uplifted its foundation.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And a sound was heard like the trumpet-blast</line>
      <line> That shall one day wake the dead;</line>
      <line>The strong church-door could bear no more,</line>
      <line>And the bolts and the bars they fled;</line>
      <line>And the tapers’ light was extinguished quite</line>
      <line>And the choristers faintly sung;</line>
      <line>And the priests dismayed, panted and prayed,</line>
      <line>And on all saints in Heaven for aid</line>
      <line>They called with trembling tongue!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And in He came with eyes of flame,</line>
      <line>The Devil to fetch the dead,</line>
      <line> And all the church with his presence glowed</line>
      <line>Like a fiery furnace red.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He laid his hand on the iron chains,</line>
      <line>And like flax they mouldered asunder,</line>
      <line>And the coffin-lid, which was barred so firm,</line>
      <line>He burst with his voice of thunder.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he bade the old Woman of Berkeley rise,</line>
      <line>And come with her master away –</line>
      <line>A cold sweat started on that cold corpse</line>
      <line>At the voice she was forced to obey!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> She rose on her feet in her winding-sheet,</line>
      <line>Her dead flesh quivered with fear,</line>
      <line>And a groan like that which the Old Woman gave</line>
      <line>Never did mortal hear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She followed her Master to the church-door –</line>
      <line>There stood a black horse there,</line>
      <line>His breath was red like furnace-smoke,</line>
      <line>His eyes like a meteor’s glare.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Devil he flung her on the horse,</line>
      <line>And he leapt up before,</line>
      <line> And away like the lightning’s speed they went,</line>
      <line>And she was seen no more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They saw her no more, but her cries</line>
      <line>For four miles round they could hear,</line>
      <line>And children at rest at their mother’s breast</line>
      <line>Started, and screamed with fear!</line>

    <title>The Haunted Beach</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upon a lonely desert beach</line>
      <line>Where the white foam was scattered,</line>
      <line>A little shed upreared its head</line>
      <line>Though lofty barks were shattered.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The sea-weeds gathering near the door</line>
      <line>A sombre path displayed;</line>
      <line>And, all around, the deafening roar</line>
      <line>Re-echoed on the chalky shore,</line>
      <line>By the green billows made.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Above a jutting cliff was seen</line>
      <line>Where sea-birds hovered, craving;</line>
      <line>And all around the crags were bound</line>
      <line>With weeds – for ever waving.</line>
      <line>And here and there, a cavern wide</line>
      <line> Its shadowy jaws displayed;</line>
      <line>And near the sands, at ebb of tide,</line>
      <line>A shivered mast was seen to ride</line>
      <line>Where the green billows strayed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And often, while the moaning wind</line>
      <line>Stole o’er the summer ocean,</line>
      <line>The moonlight scene was all serene,</line>
      <line>The waters scarce in motion;</line>
      <line>Then, while the smoothly slanting sand</line>
      <line>The tall cliff wrapped in shade,</line>
      <line> The fisherman beheld a band</line>
      <line>Of spectres gliding hand in hand –</line>
      <line>Where the green billows played.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And pale their faces were as snow,</line>
      <line>And sullenly they wandered;</line>
      <line>And to the skies with hollow eyes</line>
      <line>They looked as though they pondered.</line>
      <line>And sometimes, from their hammock-shroud,</line>
      <line>They dismal howlings made,</line>
      <line>And while the blast blew strong and loud</line>
      <line> The clear moon marked the ghastly crowd,</line>
      <line>Where the green billows played!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then above the haunted hut</line>
      <line>The curlews screaming hovered;</line>
      <line>And the low door, with furious roar,</line>
      <line>The frothy breakers covered.</line>
      <line>For in the fisherman’s lone shed</line>
      <line>A murdered man was laid,</line>
      <line>With ten wide gashes in his head,</line>
      <line>And deep was made his sandy bed</line>
      <line> Where the green billows played.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A shipwrecked mariner was he,</line>
      <line>Doomed from his home to sever,</line>
      <line>Who swore to be through wind and sea</line>
      <line>Firm and undaunted ever!</line>
      <line>And when the wave resistless rolled,</line>
      <line>About his arm he made</line>
      <line>A packet rich of Spanish gold,</line>
      <line>And, like a British sailor bold,</line>
      <line>Plunged where the billows played!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The spectre band, his messmates brave,</line>
      <line>Sunk in the yawning ocean,</line>
      <line>While to the mast he lashed him fast,</line>
      <line>And braved the storm’s commotion.</line>
      <line>The winter moon upon the sand</line>
      <line>A silvery carpet made,</line>
      <line>And marked the sailor reach the land,</line>
      <line>And marked his murderer wash his hand</line>
      <line>Where the green billows played.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And since that hour the fisherman</line>
      <line> Has toiled and toiled in vain;</line>
      <line>For all the night the moony light</line>
      <line>Gleams on the spectered main!</line>
      <line>And when the skies are veiled in gloom,</line>
      <line>The murderer’s liquid way</line>
      <line>Bounds o’er the deeply yawning tomb,</line>
      <line>And flashing fires the sands illume,</line>
      <line>Where the green billows play!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Full thirty years his task has been,</line>
      <line>Day after day more weary;</line>
      <line> For Heaven designed his guilty mind</line>
      <line>Should dwell on prospects dreary.</line>
      <line>Bound by a strong and mystic chain,</line>
      <line>He has not power to stray;</line>
      <line>But destined misery to sustain,</line>
      <line>He wastes, in solitude and pain,</line>
      <line>A loathsome life away.</line>

    <title>From The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright,</line>
      <line>Go visit it by the pale moon-light;</line>
      <line>For the gay beams of lightsome day</line>
      <line>Gild, but to flout, the ruins grey.</line>
      <line> When the broken arches are black in night,</line>
      <line>And each shafted oriel glimmers white;</line>
      <line>When the cold light’s uncertain shower</line>
      <line>Streams on the ruined central tower;</line>
      <line>When buttress and buttress, alternately,</line>
      <line>Seem framed of ebon and ivory;</line>
      <line>When silver edges the imagery,</line>
      <line>And the scrolls that teach thee to live and die;</line>
      <line>When distant Tweed is heard to rave,</line>
      <line>And the owlet to hoot o’er the dead man’s grave;</line>
      <line> Then go – but go alone the while –</line>
      <line>Then view St David’s ruined pile;</line>
      <line>And, home returning, soothly swear,</line>
      <line>Was never scene so sad and fair!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Short halt did Deloraine make there;</line>
      <line>Little recked he of the scene so fair.</line>
      <line>With dagger’s hilt, on the wicket strong,</line>
      <line>He struck full loud, and struck full long.</line>
      <line>The porter hurried to the gate –</line>
      <line>‘Who knocks so loud, and knocks so late?’</line>
      <line> ‘From Branksome I’, the warrior cried;</line>
      <line>And strait the wicket opened wide:</line>
      <line>For Branksome’s chiefs had in battle stood,</line>
      <line>To fence the rights of fair Melrose;</line>
      <line>And lands and livings, many a rood,</line>
      <line>Had gifted the shrine for their souls’ repose.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Bold Deloraine his errand said;</line>
      <line>The porter bent his humble head;</line>
      <line>With torch in hand, and foot unshod,</line>
      <line>And noiseless step, the path he trod;</line>
      <line> The archéd cloisters, far and wide,</line>
      <line>Rang to the warrior’s clanking stride;</line>
      <line>Till, stooping low his lofty crest,</line>
      <line>He entered the cell of the ancient priest,</line>
      <line>And lifted his barréd aventayle,</line>
      <line>To hail the Monk of St Mary’s aisle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘The Ladye of Branksome greets thee by me –</line>
      <line>Says that the fated hour is come,</line>
      <line>And that to-night I shall watch with thee,</line>
      <line>To win the treasure of the tomb.’</line>
      <line> From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,</line>
      <line>With toil his stiffened limbs he reared</line>
      <line>(A hundred years had flung their snows</line>
      <line>On his thin locks and floating beard),</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And strangely on the knight looked he,</line>
      <line>And his blue eyes gleamed wild and wide:</line>
      <line>‘And, darest thou, warrior, seek to see</line>
      <line>What Heaven and Hell alike would hide ?</line>
      <line>My breast, in belt of iron pent,</line>
      <line>With shirt of hair and scourge of thorn,</line>
      <line> For threescore years, in penance spent,</line>
      <line>My knees those flinty stones have worn –</line>
      <line>Yet all too little to atone</line>
      <line>For knowing what should ne’er be known.</line>
      <line>Wouldst thou thy every future year</line>
      <line>In ceaseless prayer and penance drie,</line>
      <line>Yet wait thy latter end with fear? –</line>
      <line>Then, daring warrior, follow me !’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Penance, father, will I none!</line>
      <line>Prayer know I hardly one –</line>
      <line> For mass or prayer can I rarely tarry,</line>
      <line>Save to patter an Avé Mary</line>
      <line>When I ride on a Border foray –</line>
      <line>Other prayer can I none</line>
      <line>So speed me my errand, and let me be gone.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Again on the Knight looked the Churchman old</line>
      <line>And again he sighed heavily;</line>
      <line>For he had himself been a warrior bold,</line>
      <line>And fought in Spain and Italy.</line>
      <line>And he thought on the days that were long since bye,</line>
      <line> When his limbs were strong, and his courage was high;</line>
      <line>Now, slow and faint, he led the way,</line>
      <line>Where, cloistered round, the garden lay;</line>
      <line>The pillared arches were over their head,</line>
      <line>And beneath their feet were the bones of the dead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Spreading herbs and flowerets bright,</line>
      <line>Glistened with the dew of night;</line>
      <line>Nor herb nor floweret glistened there,</line>
      <line>But was carved in the cloister arches as fair.</line>
      <line>The Monk gazed long on the lovely moon,</line>
      <line> Then into the night he lookéd forth;</line>
      <line>And red and bright the streamers light</line>
      <line>Were dancing in the glowing north.</line>
      <line>So had he seen, in fair Castile,</line>
      <line>The youth in glittering squadrons start;</line>
      <line>Sudden the flying jennet wheel,</line>
      <line>And hurl the unexpected dart.</line>
      <line>He knew, by the streamers that shot so bright,</line>
      <line>That spirits were riding the northern light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By a steel-clenchéd postern-door,</line>
      <line> They entered now the chancel tall;</line>
      <line>The darkened roof rose high aloof</line>
      <line>On pillars lofty, and light, and small;</line>
      <line>The keystone, that locked each ribbéd aisle,</line>
      <line>Was a fleur-de-lys, or a quatre-feuille;</line>
      <line>The corbells were carved grotesque and grim;</line>
      <line>And the pillars, with clustered shafts so trim,</line>
      <line>With plinth and with capital flourished around,</line>
      <line>Seemed bundles of lances which garlands had bound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Full many a scutcheon and banner riven</line>
      <line>Shook to the cold night-wind of heaven,</line>
      <line>Around the screenéd altar’s pale;</line>
      <line>And there the dying lamps did burn,</line>
      <line>Before thy low and lonely urn,</line>
      <line>Oh gallant chief of Otterburne,</line>
      <line>And thine, dark knight of Liddesdale!</line>
      <line>Oh fading honours of the dead!</line>
      <line>Oh high ambition, lowly laid!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The moon on the east oriel shone,</line>
      <line>Through slender shafts of shapely stone,</line>
      <line> By foliaged tracery combined;</line>
      <line>Thou wouldst have thought some fairy’s hand,</line>
      <line>’Twixt poplars straight, the osier wand,</line>
      <line>In many a freakish knot, had twined –</line>
      <line>Then framed a spell, when the work was done,</line>
      <line>And changed the willow-wreaths to stone.</line>
      <line>The silver light, so pale and faint,</line>
      <line>Shewed many a prophet and many a saint,</line>
      <line>Whose image on the glass was dyed;</line>
      <line>Full in the midst, his cross of red</line>
      <line> Triumphant Michael brandishéd,</line>
      <line>And trampled the apostate’s pride.</line>
      <line>The moonbeam kissed the holy pane,</line>
      <line>And threw on the pavement a bloody stain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They sate them down on a marble stone</line>
      <line>(A Scottish monarch slept below);</line>
      <line>Thus spoke the Monk, in solemn tone:</line>
      <line>‘I was not always a man of woe,</line>
      <line>For Paynim countries I have trod</line>
      <line>And fought beneath the cross of God –</line>
      <line> Now, strange to my eyes thine arms appear,</line>
      <line>And their iron clang sounds strange to my ear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In these far climes, it was my lot</line>
      <line>To meet the wondrous Michael Scott;</line>
      <line>A wizard of such dreaded fame,</line>
      <line>That when, in Salamanca’s cave,</line>
      <line>Him listed his magic wand to wave,</line>
      <line>The bells would ring in Notre Dame!</line>
      <line>Some of his skill he taught to me;</line>
      <line>And, warrior, I could say to thee</line>
      <line> The words that clove Eildon hills in three,</line>
      <line>And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone;</line>
      <line>But to speak them were a deadly sin;</line>
      <line>And for having but thought them my heart within,</line>
      <line>A treble penance must be done.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When Michael lay on his dying-bed,</line>
      <line>His conscience was awakenéd;</line>
      <line>He bethought him of his sinful deed,</line>
      <line>And he gave me a sign to come with speed:</line>
      <line>I was in Spain when the morning rose,</line>
      <line> But I stood by his bed ere evening close!</line>
      <line>The words may not again be said</line>
      <line>That he spoke to me, on death-bed laid;</line>
      <line>They would rend this Abbaye’s massy nave,</line>
      <line>And pile it in heaps above his grave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I swore to bury his mighty book,</line>
      <line>That never mortal might therein look;</line>
      <line>And never to tell where it was hid,</line>
      <line>Save at his chief of Branksome’s need –</line>
      <line>And when that need was past and o’er,</line>
      <line> Again the volume to restore.</line>
      <line>I buried him on St Michael’s night,</line>
      <line>When the bell tolled one, and the moon was bright;</line>
      <line>And I dug his chamber among the dead,</line>
      <line>Where the floor of the chancel was stainéd red,</line>
      <line>That his patron’s cross might over him wave,</line>
      <line>And scare the fiends from the wizard’s grave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was a night of woe and dread,</line>
      <line>When Michael in the tomb I laid!</line>
      <line>Strange sounds along the chancel past;</line>
      <line> The banners waved without a blast!’</line>
      <line>(Still spoke the Monk, when the bell tolled one –</line>
      <line>I tell you, that a braver man</line>
      <line>Than William of Deloraine, good at need,</line>
      <line>Against a foe ne’er spurred a steed;</line>
      <line>Yet somewhat was he chilled with dread,</line>
      <line>And his hair did bristle upon his head.)</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Lo, warrior, now the cross of red</line>
      <line>Points to the grave of the mighty dead;</line>
      <line>Within it burns a wondrous light,</line>
      <line> To chase the spirits that love the night:</line>
      <line>That lamp shall burn unquenchably,</line>
      <line>Until the eternal doom shall be.’</line>
      <line>Slow moved the Monk to the broad flagstone,</line>
      <line>Which the bloody cross was traced upon:</line>
      <line>He pointed to a secret nook;</line>
      <line>A bar from thence the warrior took;</line>
      <line>And the Monk made a sign with his withered hand,</line>
      <line>The grave’s huge portal to expand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With beating heart to the task he went</line>
      <line> (His sinewy frame o’er the gravestone bent),</line>
      <line>With bar of iron heaved amain,</line>
      <line>Till the toil-drops fell from his brows like rain!</line>
      <line>It was by dint of passing strength</line>
      <line>That he moved the massy stone at length.</line>
      <line>I would you had been there to see</line>
      <line>How the light broke forth so gloriously –</line>
      <line>Streamed upward to the chancel roof,</line>
      <line>And through the galleries far aloof!</line>
      <line>No earthly flame blazed e’er so bright:</line>
      <line>It shone like Heaven’s own blesséd light,</line>
      <line>And, issuing from the tomb,</line>
      <line>Shewed the Monk’s cowl and visage pale,</line>
      <line>Danced on the dark-browed Warrior’s mail,</line>
      <line>And kissed his waving plume.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Before their eyes the wizard lay</line>
      <line>As if he had not been dead a day,</line>
      <line>His hoary beard in silver rolled</line>
      <line>(He seemed some seventy winters old),</line>
      <line>A palmer’s amice wrapped him round,</line>
      <line> With a wrought Spanish baldric bound,</line>
      <line>Like a pilgrim from beyond the sea;</line>
      <line>His left hand held his book of might,</line>
      <line>A silver cross was in his right;</line>
      <line>The lamp was placed beside his knee.</line>
      <line>High and majestic was his look,</line>
      <line>At which the fellest fiends had shook,</line>
      <line>And all unruffled was his face –</line>
      <line>They trusted his soul had gotten grace!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Often had William of Deloraine</line>
      <line> Rode through the battle’s bloody plain,</line>
      <line>And trampled down the warriors slain,</line>
      <line>And neither known remorse or awe;</line>
      <line>Yet now remorse and awe he owned:</line>
      <line>His breath came thick, his head swam round,</line>
      <line>When this strange scene of death he saw!</line>
      <line>Bewildered and unnerved he stood,</line>
      <line>And the priest prayed fervently and loud –</line>
      <line>With eyes averted prayéd he,</line>
      <line>He might not endure the sight to see</line>
      <line> Of the man he had loved so brotherly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the priest his death-prayer had prayed,</line>
      <line>Thus unto Deloraine he said:</line>
      <line>‘Now speed thee what thou hast to do,</line>
      <line>Or, warrior, we may dearly rue;</line>
      <line>For those thou mayest not look upon</line>
      <line>Are gathering fast round the yawning stone!’</line>
      <line>Then Deloraine, in terror, took</line>
      <line>From the cold hand the mighty book,</line>
      <line>With iron clasped and with iron bound –</line>
      <line> He thought as he took it the dead man frowned,</line>
      <line>But the glare of the sepulchral light</line>
      <line>Perchance had dazzled the warrior’s sight.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When the huge stone sunk o’er the tomb</line>
      <line>The night returned, in double gloom,</line>
      <line>For the moon had gone down and the stars were few,</line>
      <line>And, as the Knight and Priest withdrew,</line>
      <line>With wavering steps and dizzy brain,</line>
      <line>They hardly might the postern gain.</line>
      <line>’Tis said, as through the aisles they passed</line>
      <line> They heard strange noises on the blast;</line>
      <line>And through the cloister-galleries small,</line>
      <line>Which at mid-height thread the chancel-wall,</line>
      <line>Loud sobs, and laughter louder, ran –</line>
      <line>And voices unlike the voice of man,</line>
      <line>As if the fiends kept holiday</line>
      <line>Because these spells were brought today.</line>
      <line>I cannot tell how the truth may be,</line>
      <line>I say the tale as ’twas said to me!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Now hie thee hence’, the father said,</line>
      <line> ‘And when we are on death-bed laid,</line>
      <line>O may our dear Ladye, and sweet St John,</line>
      <line>Forgive our souls for the deed we have done!’</line>
      <line>The Monk returned him to his cell,</line>
      <line>And many a prayer and penance sped –</line>
      <line>When the Convent met at the noontide-bell,</line>
      <line>The Monk of St Mary’s aisle was dead...</line>

      <line> Her hands she rung, and at times she sung</line>

      <line>She told it for a meed:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘I once had a son, but now he is gone –</line>
      <line>They tore my son from me –</line>

      <line> One evening late by the chimney I sate:</line>

      <line>Of its chirrup so eerie the cricket was weary,</line>
      <line>All silent I sate and alone.</line>

      <line>The fire burnt bright, and I saw by the light</line>
      <line>My own son enter the hall;</line>
      <line>A white birchen wand he held in his hand,</line>
      <line>But no shadow had he on the wall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He looked at the flame, as forward he came,</line>
      <line>All steadfast, and looked not away;</line>
      <line> His motion was still as mist on the hill,</line>
      <line>And his colour like cold-white clay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I knew him full well – but the tones of the bell</line>
      <line>Which quavered as midnight it rung</line>
      <line>So stunned me I strove, but I could not move</line>
      <line>My hand, my foot, nor my tongue.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Blood-drops in a shower then fell on the floor</line>
      <line>From the roof, and they fell upon me:</line>
      <line>No water their stain could wash out again –</line>
      <line>Those blood-drops still may you see!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> His form still grew, and the flame burnt blue,</line>
      <line>I stretched out my arms to embrace;</line>
      <line>But he turned his dead eye, so hollow and dry,</line>
      <line>And so wistfully gazed in my face,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That my head whirled round, and the walls and the ground</line>
      <line>All darkened – no more could I see –</line>
      <line>But each finger’s point, and each finger’s joint,</line>
      <line>Grew thick as the joint of my knee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I wakened ere day, but my son was away,</line>
      <line>No word to me had he said;</line>
      <line> Though my blood was boiling, and my heart recoiling,</line>
      <line>To see him again still I prayed –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And often he has come to my lonely home,</line>
      <line>In guise that might adamant melt:</line>
      <line>He has offered his hand with expression so bland,</line>
      <line>But that hand could never be felt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ve oft seen him glide so close by my side,</line>
      <line>On his grave-cloth the seams I could trace:</line>
      <line>The blood from a wound trickled down to the ground,</line>
      <line>And a napkin was over his face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> So oft have I seen that death-like mien</line>
      <line>It has somewhat bewildered my brain;</line>
      <line>Yet though chilled with affright at the terrible sight,</line>
      <line>I long still to see it again!</line>

    <title>Peter Grimes</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Old Peter Grimes made fishing his employ</line>
      <line>(His wife he cabined with him and his boy)</line>
      <line>And seemed that life laborious to enjoy:</line>
      <line>To town came quiet Peter with his fish,</line>
      <line> And had of all a civil word and wish.</line>
      <line>He left his trade upon the Sabbath-day,</line>
      <line>And took young Peter in his hand to pray;</line>
      <line>But soon the stubborn boy from care broke loose,</line>
      <line>At first refused, then added his abuse.</line>
      <line>His father’s love he scorned, his power defied,</line>
      <line>But being drunk, wept sorely when he died.</line>
      <line>Yes, then he wept, and to his mind there came</line>
      <line>Much of his conduct, and he felt the shame –</line>
      <line>How he had oft the good old man reviled,</line>
      <line> And never paid the duty of a child;</line>
      <line>How, when the father in his Bible read,</line>
      <line>He in contempt and anger left the shed.</line>
      <line>‘It is the word of life’, the parent cried!</line>
      <line>‘This is the life itself’, the boy replied.</line>
      <line>And, while old Peter in amazement stood,</line>
      <line>Gave the hot spirit to his boiling blood;</line>
      <line>How he, with oath and furious speech, began</line>
      <line>To prove his freedom and assert the man;</line>
      <line>And when the parent checked his impious rage,</line>
      <line> How he had cursed the tyranny of age –</line>
      <line>Nay, once had dealt the sacrilegious blow</line>
      <line>On his bare head, and laid his parent low.</line>
      <line>The father groaned, ‘If thou art old’, said he,</line>
      <line>And hast a son, thou wilt remember me:</line>
      <line>Thy mother left me in a happy time,</line>
      <line>Thou killedst not her! Heaven spares the double crime.’</line>
      <line>On an inn-settle, in his maudlin grief,</line>
      <line>This he revolved, and drank for his relief.</line>
      <line>Now lived the youth in freedom, but debarred</line>
      <line> From constant pleasure, and he thought it hard –</line>
      <line>Hard that he could not every wish obey,</line>
      <line>But must awhile relinquish ale and play –</line>
      <line>Hard that he could not to his cards attend,</line>
      <line>But must acquire the money he would spend!</line>
      <line>With greedy eye he looked on all he saw</line>
      <line>(He knew not justice, and he laughed at law),</line>
      <line>On all he marked he stretched his ready hand –</line>
      <line>He fished by water and he filched by land!</line>
      <line>Oft in the night has Peter dropped his oar,</line>
      <line> Fled from his boat, and sought for prey on shore;</line>
      <line>Oft up the hedgerow glided, on his back</line>
      <line>Bearing the orchard’s produce in a sack,</line>
      <line>Or farm-yard load, tugged fiercely from the stack.</line>
      <line>And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose,</line>
      <line>The more he looked on all men as his foes.</line>
      <line>He built a mud-walled hovel, where he kept</line>
      <line>His various wealth, and there he oft-times slept;</line>
      <line>But no success could please his cruel soul:</line>
      <line>He wished for one to trouble and control –</line>
      <line> He wanted some obedient boy to stand</line>
      <line>And bear the blow of his outrageous hand,</line>
      <line>And hoped to find in some propitious hour</line>
      <line>A feeling creature subject to his power.</line>
      <line>Peter had heard there were in London then</line>
      <line>(Still have they being!) workhouse clearing-men,</line>
      <line>Who, undisturbed by feelings just or kind,</line>
      <line>Would parish-boys to needy tradesmen bind:</line>
      <line>They in their want a trifling sum would take,</line>
      <line>And toiling slaves of piteous orphans make.</line>
      <line> Such Peter sought, and when a lad was found,</line>
      <line>The sum was dealt him, and the slave was bound.</line>
      <line>Some few in town observed in Peter’s trap</line>
      <line>A boy, with jacket blue and woollen cap;</line>
      <line>But none enquired how Peter used the rope,</line>
      <line>Or what the bruise that made the stripling stoop;</line>
      <line>None could the ridges on his back behold,</line>
      <line>None sought him shivering in the winter’s cold;</line>
      <line>None put the question, ‘Peter, dost thou give</line>
      <line>The boy his food? What, man, the lad must live!</line>
      <line> Consider, Peter, let the child have bread,</line>
      <line>He’ll serve thee better if he’s stroked and fed.’</line>
      <line>None reasoned thus, and some, on hearing cries,</line>
      <line>Said calmly, ‘Grimes is at his exercise.’</line>
      <line>Pinned, beaten, cold, pinched, threatened and abused,</line>
      <line>His efforts punished and his food refused,</line>
      <line>Awake tormented (soon aroused from sleep),</line>
      <line>Struck if he wept, and yet compelled to weep,</line>
      <line>The trembling boy dropped down and strove to pray,</line>
      <line>Received a blow, and trembling turned away,</line>
      <line> Or sobbed and hid his piteous face – while he,</line>
      <line>The savage master, grinned in horrid glee!</line>
      <line>He’d now the power he ever loved to show,</line>
      <line>A feeling being subject to his blow.</line>
      <line>Thus lived the lad, in hunger, peril, pain,</line>
      <line>His tears despised, his supplications vain.</line>
      <line>Compelled by fear to lie, by need to steal,</line>
      <line>His bed uneasy and unblest his meal,</line>
      <line>For three sad years the boy his tortures bore,</line>
      <line>And then his pains and trials were no more.</line>
      <line> ‘How died he, Peter?’ when the people said,</line>
      <line>He growled, ‘I found him lifeless in his bed’ –</line>
      <line>Then tried for softer tone, and sighed, ‘Poor Sam is dead.’</line>
      <line>Yet murmurs were there, and some questions asked –</line>
      <line>How he was fed, how punished, and how tasked?</line>
      <line>Much they suspected, but they little proved,</line>
      <line>And Peter passed untroubled and unmoved.</line>
      <line>Another boy with equal ease was found,</line>
      <line>The money granted, and the victim bound –</line>
      <line>And what his fate? One night it chanced he fell</line>
      <line>From the boat’s mast and perished in her well,</line>
      <line>Where fish were living kept, and where the boy,</line>
      <line>So reasoned men, could not himself destroy.</line>
      <line>‘Yes, so it was’, said Peter. ‘In his play</line>
      <line>(For he was idle both by night and day)</line>
      <line>He climbed the mainmast and then fell below’ –</line>
      <line>Then showed his corpse, and pointed to the blow.</line>
      <line>What said the jury? They were long in doubt,</line>
      <line>But sturdy Peter faced the matter out;</line>
      <line>So they dismissed him, saying at the time,</line>
      <line> ‘Keep fast your hatchway when you’ve boys who climb.’</line>
      <line>This hit the conscience, and he coloured more</line>
      <line>Than for the closest questions put before.</line>
      <line>Thus all his fears the verdict set aside,</line>
      <line>And at the slave-shop Peter still applied.</line>
      <line>Then came a boy of manners soft and mild –</line>
      <line>Our seamen’s wives with grief beheld the child;</line>
      <line>All thought (the poor themselves) that he was one</line>
      <line>Of gentle blood, some noble sinner’s son,</line>
      <line>Who had, belike, deceived some humble maid,</line>
      <line> Whom he had first seduced and then betrayed.</line>
      <line>However this, he seemed a gracious lad,</line>
      <line>In grief submissive and with patience sad.</line>
      <line>Passive he laboured, till his slender frame</line>
      <line>Bent with his loads, and he at length was lame –</line>
      <line>Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long</line>
      <line>The grossest insult and the foulest wrong,</line>
      <line>But there were causes: in the town they gave</line>
      <line>Fire, food, and comfort, to the gentle slave;</line>
      <line>And though stern Peter, with a cruel hand</line>
      <line> And knotted rope, enforced the rude command,</line>
      <line>Yet he considered what he’d lately felt,</line>
      <line>And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt.</line>
      <line>One day such draughts the cruel fisher made,</line>
      <line>He could not vend them in his borough-trade,</line>
      <line>But sailed for London-mart. The boy was ill,</line>
      <line>But ever humbled to his master’s will,</line>
      <line>And on the river, where they smoothly sailed,</line>
      <line>He strove with terror and awhile prevailed –</line>
      <line>But new to danger on the angry sea,</line>
      <line> He clung affrightened to his master’s knee.</line>
      <line>The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong,</line>
      <line>Rough was the passage and the time was long;</line>
      <line>His liquor failed, and Peter’s wrath arose –</line>
      <line>No more is known, the rest we must suppose</line>
      <line>Or learn of Peter. Peter says he spied</line>
      <line>The stripling’s danger and for harbour tried –</line>
      <line>Meantime the fish, and then the apprentice, died.’</line>
      <line>The pitying women raised a clamour round</line>
      <line>And weeping said, ‘Thou hast thy ‘prentice drowned.’</line>
      <line> Now the stern man was summoned to the hall</line>
      <line>To tell his tale before the burghers all –</line>
      <line>He gave the account, professed the lad he loved,</line>
      <line>And kept his brazen features all unmoved.</line>
      <line>The mayor himself with tone severe replied:</line>
      <line>‘Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide.</line>
      <line>Hire thee a freeman, whom thou durst not beat,</line>
      <line>But who in thy despite will sleep and eat!</line>
      <line>Free thou art now – again shouldst thou appear,</line>
      <line>Thou’lt find thy sentence, like thy soul, severe.’</line>
      <line> Alas for Peter! Not a helping hand</line>
      <line>(So was he hated) could he now command –</line>
      <line>Alone he rowed his boat, alone he cast</line>
      <line>His nets beside, or made his anchor fast.</line>
      <line>To hold a rope, or hear a curse, was none –</line>
      <line>He toiled and railed, he groaned and swore, alone.</line>
      <line>Thus by himself compelled to live each day,</line>
      <line>To wait for certain hours the tide’s delay,</line>
      <line>At the same time the same dull views to see:</line>
      <line>The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree;</line>
      <line> The water only, when the tides were high,</line>
      <line>When low, the mud half-covered and half-dry;</line>
      <line>The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks,</line>
      <line>And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks;</line>
      <line>Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float,</line>
      <line>As the tide rolls by the impeded boat.</line>
      <line>When tides were neap, and, in the sultry day,</line>
      <line>Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way,</line>
      <line>Which on each side rose swelling, and below</line>
      <line>The dark warm flood ran silently and slow,</line>
      <line> There anchoring, Peter chose from man to hide,</line>
      <line>There hang his head, and view the lazy tide</line>
      <line>In its hot slimy channel slowly glide.</line>
      <line>Where the small eels, that left the deeper way</line>
      <line>For the warm shore, within the shallows play –</line>
      <line>Where gaping mussels, left upon the mud,</line>
      <line>Slope their slow passage to the fallen flood –</line>
      <line>Here dull and hopeless he’d lie down and trace</line>
      <line>How sidelong crabs had scrawled their crooked race,</line>
      <line>Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry</line>
      <line> Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye.</line>
      <line>What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come,</line>
      <line>And the loud bittern, from the bullrush home,</line>
      <line>Gave from the salt-ditch side the bellowing boom,</line>
      <line>He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce</line>
      <line>And loved to stop beside the opening sluice</line>
      <line>Where the small stream, confined in narrow bound,</line>
      <line>Ran with a dull, unvaried, saddening sound –</line>
      <line>Where all presented to the eye or ear</line>
      <line>Oppressed the soul with misery, grief, and fear.</line>
      <line>Besides these objects, there were places three</line>
      <line>Which Peter seemed with certain dread to see:</line>
      <line>When he drew near them he would turn from each,</line>
      <line>And loudly whistle till he passed the reach.</line>
      <line>A change of scene to him brought no relief:</line>
      <line>In town, ’twas plain, men took him for a thief;</line>
      <line>The sailors’ wives would stop him in the street</line>
      <line>And say, ‘Now, Peter, thou’st no boy to beat!’</line>
      <line>Infants at play, when they perceived him, ran,</line>
      <line>Warning each other – ‘That’s the wicked man!’</line>
      <line> He growled an oath, and in an angry tone</line>
      <line>Cursed the whole place, and wished to be alone.</line>
      <line>Alone he was, the same dull scenes in view,</line>
      <line>And still more gloomy in his sight they grew.</line>
      <line>Though man he hated, yet, employed alone</line>
      <line>At bootless labour, he would swear and groan,</line>
      <line>Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot</line>
      <line>And gulls that caught them when his arts could not.</line>
      <line>Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame,</line>
      <line>And strange disease (he couldn’t say the name);</line>
      <line> Wild were his dreams, and oft he rose in fright,</line>
      <line>Waked by his view of horrors in the night –</line>
      <line>Horrors that would the sternest minds amaze,</line>
      <line>Horrors that demons might be proud to raise.</line>
      <line>And though he felt forsaken, grieved at heart</line>
      <line>To think he lived from all mankind apart,</line>
      <line>Yet, if a man approached, in terrors he would start.</line>
      <line>A winter passed since Peter saw the town,</line>
      <line>And summer lodgers were again come down;</line>
      <line>These, idly curious, with their glasses spied</line>
      <line> The ships in bay (as anchored for the tide</line>
      <line>The river’s craft) the bustle of the quay –</line>
      <line>And seaport views, which landsmen love to see.</line>
      <line>One, up the river, had a man and boat</line>
      <line>Seen day by day, now anchored, now afloat.</line>
      <line>Fisher he seemed, yet used no net nor hook;</line>
      <line>Of sea-fowl swimming by no heed he took,</line>
      <line>But on the gliding waves still fixed his lazy look.</line>
      <line>At certain stations he would view the stream,</line>
      <line>As if he stood bewildered in a dream,</line>
      <line> Or that some power had chained him for a time</line>
      <line>To feel a curse or meditate on crime.</line>
      <line>This known, some curious, some in pity, went,</line>
      <line>And others questioned: ‘Wretch, dost thou repent?’</line>
      <line>He heard, he trembled, and in fear resigned</line>
      <line>His boat. New terror filled his restless mind;</line>
      <line>Furious he grew, and up the country ran,</line>
      <line>And there they seized him – a distempered man.</line>
      <line>Him we received, and to a parish-bed,</line>
      <line>Followed and cursed, the groaning man was led.</line>
      <line> Here when they saw him, whom they used to shun –</line>
      <line>A lost, lone man, so harassed and undone –</line>
      <line>Our gentle females (ever prompt to feel)</line>
      <line>Perceived compassion on their anger steal.</line>
      <line>His crimes they could not from their memories blot,</line>
      <line>But they were grieved, and trembled at his lot.</line>
      <line>A priest too came, to whom his words are told –</line>
      <line>And all the signs they shuddered to behold.</line>
      <line>‘Look! look!’ they cried ‘his limbs with horror shake,</line>
      <line>And as he grinds his teeth, what noise they make!</line>
      <line> How glare his angry eyes, and yet he’s not awake!</line>
      <line>See what cold drops upon his forehead stand,</line>
      <line>And how he clenches that broad bony hand!’</line>
      <line>The priest attending found he spoke at times</line>
      <line>As one alluding to his fears and crimes:</line>
      <line>‘It was the fall’, he muttered, ‘I can show</line>
      <line>The manner how – I never struck a blow.’</line>
      <line>And then aloud, ‘Unhand me, free my chain.</line>
      <line>On oath he fell – it struck him to the brain.</line>
      <line>Why ask my father? That old man will swear</line>
      <line> Against my life – besides, he wasn’t there.</line>
      <line>What, all agreed? Am I to die to-day?</line>
      <line>My Lord, in mercy give me time to pray.’</line>
      <line>Then as they watched him, calmer he became,</line>
      <line>And grew so weak he couldn’t move his frame,</line>
      <line>But murmuring spake–while they could see and hear</line>
      <line>The start of terror and the groan of fear –</line>
      <line>See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise,</line>
      <line>And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes.</line>
      <line>Nor yet he died, but with unwonted force</line>
      <line> Seemed with some fancied being to discourse.</line>
      <line>He knew not us, or with accustomed art</line>
      <line>He hid the knowledge, yet exposed his heart –</line>
      <line>’Twas part confession and the rest defence,</line>
      <line>A madman’s tale, with gleams of waking sense.</line>
      <line>‘I’ll tell you all’, he said, ‘the very day</line>
      <line>When the old man first placed them in my way –</line>
      <line>My father’s spirit – he who always tried</line>
      <line>To give me trouble, when he lived and died:</line>
      <line>When he was gone he could not be content</line>
      <line> To see my days in painful labour spent,</line>
      <line>But would appoint his meetings, and he made</line>
      <line>Me watch at these, and so neglect my trade.</line>
      <line>’Twas one hot noon, all silent, still, serene,</line>
      <line>No living being had I lately seen;</line>
      <line>I paddled up and down and dipped my net,</line>
      <line>But (such his pleasure) I could nothing get –</line>
      <line>A father’s pleasure, when his toil was done,</line>
      <line>To plague and torture thus an only son!</line>
      <line>And so I sat and looked upon the stream,</line>
      <line>How it ran on, and felt as in a dream –</line>
      <line>But dream it was not. No! I fixed my eyes</line>
      <line>On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise –</line>
      <line>I saw my father on the water stand</line>
      <line>And hold a thin pale boy in either hand,</line>
      <line>And there they glided ghastly on the top</line>
      <line>Of the salt flood, and never touched a drop.</line>
      <line>I would have struck them, but they knew the intent</line>
      <line>And smiled upon the oar, and down they went.</line>
      <line>Now, from that day, whenever I began</line>
      <line> To dip my net, there stood the hard old man –</line>
      <line>He and those boys! I humbled me and prayed</line>
      <line>They would be gone – they heeded not, but stayed.</line>
      <line>Nor could I turn, nor would the boat go by,</line>
      <line>But, gazing on the spirits, there was I –</line>
      <line>They bade me leap to death, but I was loath to die.</line>
      <line>And every day, as sure as day arose,</line>
      <line>Would these three spirits meet me ere the close;</line>
      <line>To hear and mark them daily was my doom,</line>
      <line>And “Come” they said, with weak sad voices, “Come!”</line>
      <line> To row away, with all my strength I tried,</line>
      <line>But there were they, hard by me in the tide,</line>
      <line>The three unbodied forms – and “Come”, still “Come” they cried!</line>
      <line>Fathers should pity – but this old man shook</line>
      <line>His hoary locks, and froze me by a look!</line>
      <line>Thrice, when I struck them, through the water came</line>
      <line>A hollow groan, that weakened all my frame:</line>
      <line>“Father”, said I, “have mercy!” He replied</line>
      <line>I know not what – the angry spirit lied!</line>
      <line>“Didst thou not draw thy knife?” said he. ’Twas true,</line>
      <line> But I had pity and my arm withdrew –</line>
      <line>He cried for mercy, which I kindly gave,</line>
      <line>But he has no compassion in his grave.</line>
      <line>There were three places, where they ever rose</line>
      <line>(The whole long river has not such as those),</line>
      <line>Places accurst, where if a man remain</line>
      <line>He’ll see the things which strike him to the brain –</line>
      <line>And there they made me on my paddle lean</line>
      <line>And look at them for hours. Accurséd scene,</line>
      <line>When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space,</line>
      <line> Then bid me leap and join them in the place –</line>
      <line>And at my groans each little villain-sprite</line>
      <line>Enjoyed my pains and vanished in delight!</line>
      <line>In one fierce summer-day, when my poor brain</line>
      <line>Was burning hot, and cruel was my pain,</line>
      <line>Then came this father-foe – and there he stood</line>
      <line>With his two boys again, upon the flood.</line>
      <line>There was more mischief in their eyes, more glee</line>
      <line>In their pale faces when they glared at me!</line>
      <line>Still did they force me on the oar to rest,</line>
      <line> And when they saw me fainting and oppressed,</line>
      <line>He, with his hand – the old man – scooped the flood,</line>
      <line>And there came flame about him mixed with blood!</line>
      <line>He bade me stoop and look upon the place,</line>
      <line>Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face!</line>
      <line>Burning it blazed, and then I roared for pain –</line>
      <line>I thought the demons would have turned my brain.</line>
      <line>Still there they stood, and forced me to behold</line>
      <line>A place of horrors (they cannot be told) –</line>
      <line>Where the flood opened, there I heard the shriek</line>
      <line> Of tortured guilt, no earthly tongue can speak:</line>
      <line>“All days alike, for ever!” did they say,</line>
      <line>“And unremitted torments every day!”</line>
      <line>Yes, so they said.’ But here he ceased, and gazed</line>
      <line>On all around, affrightened and amazed.</line>
      <line>And still he tried to speak, and looked in dread</line>
      <line>Of frightened females gathering round his bed –</line>
      <line>Then dropped exhausted, and appeared at rest,</line>
      <line>Till the strong foe the vital powers possessed;</line>
      <line>Then with an inward, broken voice he cried,</line>
      <line> ‘Again they come!’ and muttered as he died.</line>

    <title>Darkness</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I had a dream, which was not all a dream:</line>
      <line>The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars</line>
      <line>Did wander darkling in the eternal space,</line>
      <line>Rayless and pathless, and the icy Earth</line>
      <line> Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air!</line>
      <line>Morn came, and went, and came – and brought no day.</line>
      <line>And men forgot their passions in the dread</line>
      <line>Of this their desolation; and all hearts</line>
      <line>Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light.</line>
      <line>And they did live by watchfires – and the thrones,</line>
      <line>The palaces of crownéd kings, the huts,</line>
      <line>The habitations of all things which dwell,</line>
      <line>Were burnt for beacons. Cities were consumed,</line>
      <line>And men were gathered round their blazing homes</line>
      <line> To look once more into each other’s face.</line>
      <line>Happy were those who dwelt within the eye</line>
      <line>Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch!</line>
      <line>A fearful hope was all the World contained –</line>
      <line>Forests were set on fire, but hour by hour</line>
      <line>They fell and faded, and the crackling trunks</line>
      <line>Extinguished with a crash, and all was black.</line>
      <line>The brows of men by the despairing light</line>
      <line>Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits</line>
      <line>The flashes fell upon them. Some lay down</line>
      <line> And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest</line>
      <line>Their chins upon their clenchéd hands, and smiled;</line>
      <line>And others hurried to and fro, and fed</line>
      <line>Their funeral-piles with fuel, and lookéd up</line>
      <line>With mad disquietude on the dull sky,</line>
      <line>The pall of a past World – and then again</line>
      <line>With curses cast them down upon the dust,</line>
      <line>And gnashed their teeth and howled. The wild birds shrieked</line>
      <line>And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,</line>
      <line>And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes</line>
      <line> Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled</line>
      <line>And twined themselves among the multitude,</line>
      <line>Hissing, but stingless – they were slain for food!</line>
      <line>And War, which for a moment was no more,</line>
      <line>Did glut himself again: a meal was bought</line>
      <line>With blood, and each sat sullenly apart</line>
      <line>Gorging himself in gloom. No love was left.</line>
      <line>All earth was but one thought, and that was death,</line>
      <line>Immediate and inglorious – and the pang</line>
      <line>Of famine fed upon all entrails! Men</line>
      <line> Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh.</line>
      <line>The meagre by the meagre were devoured.</line>
      <line>Even dogs assailed their masters – all save one,</line>
      <line>And he was faithful to a corse, and kept</line>
      <line>The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,</line>
      <line>Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead</line>
      <line>Lured their lank jaws – himself sought out no food,</line>
      <line>But with a piteous and perpetual moan,</line>
      <line>And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand</line>
      <line>Which answered not with a caress, he died.</line>
      <line> The crowd was famished by degrees; but two</line>
      <line>Of an enormous city did survive,</line>
      <line>And they were enemies. They met beside</line>
      <line>The dying embers of an altar-place</line>
      <line>Where had been heaped a mass of holy things</line>
      <line>For an unholy usage; they raked up,</line>
      <line>And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands,</line>
      <line>The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath</line>
      <line>Blew for a little life, and made a flame</line>
      <line>Which was a mockery. Then they lifted up</line>
      <line> Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld</line>
      <line>Each other’s aspects – saw, and shrieked, and died –</line>
      <line>Even of their mutual hideousness they died,</line>
      <line>Unknowing who he was upon whose brow</line>
      <line>Famine had written fiend!</line>
      <line>The world was void:</line>
      <line>The populous and the powerful was a lump,</line>
      <line>Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless –</line>
      <line>A lump of death – a chaos of hard clay!</line>
      <line>The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,</line>
      <line>And nothing stirred within their silent depths.</line>
      <line> Ships, sailorless, lay rotting on the sea,</line>
      <line>And their masts fell down piecemeal – as they dropped</line>
      <line>They slept on the abyss without a surge.</line>
      <line>The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave</line>
      <line>(The Moon, their mistress, had expired before);</line>
      <line>The winds were withered in the stagnant air,</line>
      <line>And the clouds perished – Darkness had no need</line>
      <line>Of aid from them – She was the Universe!</line>

    <title>from Superstition’s Dream</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>That time was come, or seemed as it was come,</line>
      <line>When death no longer makes the grave its home,</line>
      <line> When waking spirits leave their earthly rest</line>
      <line>To mix forever with the damned or blest,</line>
      <line>When years in drowsy thousands counted by</line>
      <line>Then hung on minutes with their destiny,</line>
      <line>When life in terror drops its draining glass</line>
      <line>And all that’s mortal like to shadows pass</line>
      <line>As ’neath approaching tempests sinks the sun,</line>
      <line>When time shall leave eternity begun.</line>
      <line>Life swooned in terror at that hour’s dread birth</line>
      <line>And as in ague, shook the fearful earth,</line>
      <line> And shuddering Nature seemed herself to shun</line>
      <line>While trembling conscience felt the deed was done!</line>
      <line>A gloomy sadness round the sky was cast,</line>
      <line>And clouds seemed hurrying with unusual haste –</line>
      <line>Winds urged them forward like to restless ships,</line>
      <line>And light dim faded with its last eclipse,</line>
      <line>While Agitation turned a straining eye,</line>
      <line>And Hope stood watching like a bird to fly,</line>
      <line>And cringing Nature (like a child in dread)</line>
      <line>Clung to her fading garments till she fled,</line>
      <line> And awful sights began to be revealed</line>
      <line>Which Death’s dark dungeons had so long concealed!</line>
      <line>Each grave its doomsday prisoner resigned,</line>
      <line>And burst in noises like an hollow wind,</line>
      <line>And spirits (mingling with the living then)</line>
      <line>Thrilled fearful voices with the cries of men,</line>
      <line>And, flying furious, grinning deep despair</line>
      <line>Shaped dismal shadows on the troubled air,</line>
      <line>And lightning shot its flashes as they came</line>
      <line>And passing clouds seemed kindling into flame</line>
      <line> And strong, and, stronger came the sulphury smell</line>
      <line>While demons followed in the breath of Hell,</line>
      <line>Grinning in mockery as the doomed complained –</line>
      <line>Losing their pains in seeing others pained!</line>
      <line>Fierce raged destruction sweeping o’er the land</line>
      <line>And the last counted moment seemed at hand;</line>
      <line>As scales near equal hang the earnest eyes</line>
      <line>In doubtful balance which shall fall or rise,</line>
      <line>So in the moment of that crashing blast</line>
      <line>Eyes hearts and hopes paused trembling for the last,</line>
      <line> And sudden thunder-claps with yawing rents</line>
      <line>Gashed the frail garment of the elements</line>
      <line>And bursting whirlwinds, winged in purple flame,</line>
      <line>And lightning’s flash in stronger terrors came</line>
      <line>Burning all life and Nature where they fell</line>
      <line>And leaving earth as desolate as Hell.</line>
      <line>The pleasant hues of fields and woods was past</line>
      <line>And Nature’s beauties had enjoyed their last:</line>
      <line>The coloured flower, the green of field and tree,</line>
      <line>What they had been forever ceased to be;</line>
      <line> Grass shriveled brown in miserable hues</line>
      <line>And showers of fire dried up the hissing dews;</line>
      <line>Leaves crumbled ashes to the air’s hot breath,</line>
      <line>And all awaited universal death...</line>

      <line>I slided, and by him stood;</line>
      <line>But I wished myself on the gallows again</line>
      <line>When I smelt that beggar’s food –</line>
      <line>A foul beef-bone, and a mouldy crust –</line>
      <line>‘Oh’, quoth he, ‘the Heavens are good!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Then, after this grace, he cast him down:</line>
      <line>Says I, ‘You’ll get sweeter air</line>
      <line>A pace or two off, on the windward side’ –</line>
      <line>For the felons’ bones lay there!</line>
      <line>But he only laughed at the empty skulls,</line>
      <line>And offered them part of his fare.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘I never harmed them, and they won’t harm me –</line>
      <line>Let the proud and the rich be cravens!’</line>
      <line>I did not like that strange beggar-man,</line>
      <line>He looked up so at the Heaven –</line>
      <line> Anon he shook out his empty old poke:</line>
      <line>‘There’s the crumbs’, saith he, ‘for the ravens!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It made me angry to see his face,</line>
      <line>It had such a jesting look;</line>
      <line>But while I made up my mind to speak,</line>
      <line>A small case-bottle he took:</line>
      <line>Quoth he, ‘Though I gather the green watercress,</line>
      <line>My drink is not of the brook!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Full manners-like he tendered the dram –</line>
      <line>Oh it came of a dainty cask –</line>
      <line> But whenever it came to his turn to pull:</line>
      <line>‘Your leave, good sir, I must ask;</line>
      <line>But I always wipe the brim with my sleeve</line>
      <line>When a hangman sups at my flask!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then he laughed so loudly and long,</line>
      <line>The churl was quite out of breath –</line>
      <line>I thought the very Old One was come</line>
      <line>To mock me before my death,</line>
      <line>And wished I had buried the dead men’s bones</line>
      <line>That were lying about the heath.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But the beggar gave me a jolly clap:</line>
      <line>‘Come, let us pledge each other,</line>
      <line>For all the wide world is dead beside’</line>
      <line>And we are brother and brother –</line>
      <line>I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart</line>
      <line>As if we had come from one mother.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart</line>
      <line>That almost makes me weep,</line>
      <line>For as I passed from town to town</line>
      <line>The folks were all stone-asleep,</line>
      <line> But when I saw thee sitting aloft</line>
      <line>It made me both laugh and leap!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now a curse (I thought) be on his love,</line>
      <line>And a curse be on his mirth,</line>
      <line>An’ it were not for that beggar-man</line>
      <line>I’d be the King of the Earth –</line>
      <line>But I promised myself an hour should come</line>
      <line>To make him rue his birth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So down we sat and boused again</line>
      <line>Till the sun was in mid-sky,</line>
      <line> When, just as the gentle west wind came,</line>
      <line>We hearkened a dismal cry:</line>
      <line>‘Up, up on the tree’, quoth the beggar-man,</line>
      <line>‘Till those horrible dogs go by!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And lo, from the forest’s far-off skirts</line>
      <line>They came all yelling for gore,</line>
      <line>A hundred hounds all yelling at once,</line>
      <line>And a panting hart before –</line>
      <line>Till he sunk down at the gallows’ foot,</line>
      <line>And there his haunches they tore!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> His haunches they tore, without a horn</line>
      <line>To tell when the chase was done,</line>
      <line>And there was not a scarlet coat</line>
      <line>To flaunt it in the sun –</line>
      <line>I turned and looked at the beggar-man,</line>
      <line>And his tears dropped one by one.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And with curses sore he chid the hounds,</line>
      <line>Till the last dropped out of sight –</line>
      <line>Anon saith he, ‘Let’s down again,</line>
      <line>And ramble for our delight,</line>
      <line> For the world’s all free, and we may choose</line>
      <line>A right cozy barn for tonight!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With that he set up his staff on end</line>
      <line>And it fell with the point due west;</line>
      <line>So we fared that way to a city great</line>
      <line>Where the folks had died of the pest –</line>
      <line>It was fine to enter in house and hall</line>
      <line>Wherever it liked me best!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For the porters all were stiff and cold,</line>
      <line>And could not lift their heads;</line>
      <line>And when we came where their masters lay,</line>
      <line>The rats leapt out of the beds –</line>
      <line>The grandest palaces in the land</line>
      <line>Were as free as workhouse-sheds.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the beggar-man made a mumping face,</line>
      <line>And knocked at every gate:</line>
      <line>It made me curse to hear how he whined,</line>
      <line>So our fellowship turned to hate,</line>
      <line>And I bade him walk the world by himself,</line>
      <line>For I scorned so humble a mate.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> So he turned right, and I turned left,</line>
      <line>As if we had never met,</line>
      <line>And I chose a fair stone-house for myself,</line>
      <line>For the city was all to let –</line>
      <line>And for three brave holydays drank my fill</line>
      <line>Of the choicest I could get!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And because my jerkin was coarse and worn</line>
      <line>I got me a properer vest;</line>
      <line>It was purple velvet, stitched over with gold,</line>
      <line>And a shining star at the breast –</line>
      <line> ’Twas enough to fetch old Joan from her grave,</line>
      <line>To see me so purely dressed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Joan was dead, and under the mould,</line>
      <line>And every buxom lass –</line>
      <line>In vane I watched at the window-pane</line>
      <line>For a Christian soul to pass,</line>
      <line>But sheep and kine wandered up the street</line>
      <line>And browsed on the new-come grass.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When lo, I spied the old beggar-man,</line>
      <line>And lustily he did sing;</line>
      <line> His rags were lapped in a scarlet cloak,</line>
      <line>And a crown he had, like a king –</line>
      <line>So he stepped right up before my gate</line>
      <line>And danced me a saucy fling!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Heaven mend us all – but within my mind</line>
      <line>I had killed him then and there</line>
      <line>To see him lording so braggart-like</line>
      <line>That was born to his beggar’s fare –</line>
      <line>And now he had stolen the royal crown</line>
      <line>His betters were meant to wear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But God forbid that a thief should die</line>
      <line>Without his share of the laws!</line>
      <line>So I nimbly whipped my tackle out</line>
      <line>And soon tied up his claws –</line>
      <line>I was judge myself, and jury, and all,</line>
      <line>And solemnly tried the cause.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the beggar-man would not plead, but cried</line>
      <line>Like a babe without its corals,</line>
      <line>For he knew how hard it is apt to go</line>
      <line>When the law and a thief have quarrels –</line>
      <line> There was not a Christian soul alive</line>
      <line>To speak a word for his morals!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh how gaily I doffed my costly gear</line>
      <line>And put on my workday clothes –</line>
      <line>I was tired of such long Sunday life,</line>
      <line>And was never one of the sloths;</line>
      <line>But the beggar-man grumbled a weary deal,</line>
      <line>And made many crooked mouths.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So I hauled him off to the gallows’ foot,</line>
      <line>And blinded him in his bags;</line>
      <line> ’Twas a weary job to heave him up</line>
      <line>(For a doomed man always lags),</line>
      <line>But by ten of the clock he was off his legs</line>
      <line>In the wind and airing his rags!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So there he hung, and there I stood</line>
      <line>The LAST MAN left alive,</line>
      <line>To have my own will of all the earth:</line>
      <line>Quoth I, ‘Now I shall thrive!’</line>
      <line>But when was ever honey made</line>
      <line>With one bee in a hive?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> My conscience began to gnaw my heart</line>
      <line>Before the day was done,</line>
      <line>For other men’s lives had all gone out</line>
      <line>Like candles in the sun –</line>
      <line>But it seemed as if I had broke at last</line>
      <line>A thousand necks in one!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So I went and cut his body down</line>
      <line>To bury it decently</line>
      <line>(God send there were any soul alive</line>
      <line>To do the same by me),</line>
      <line> But the wild dogs came with a terrible speed,</line>
      <line>And bayed me up the tree.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My sight was like a drunkard’s sight,</line>
      <line>And my head began to swim,</line>
      <line>To see their jaws all white with foam</line>
      <line>Like the ravenous ocean’s brim –</line>
      <line>But when the wild dogs trotted away</line>
      <line>Their jaws were bloody and grim!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Their jaws were bloody and grim, good Lord,</line>
      <line>But the beggar-man, where was he?</line>
      <line> There was nought of him but some ribbons of rags</line>
      <line>Below the gallows-tree –</line>
      <line>I know the Devil, when I am dead,</line>
      <line>Will send his hounds for me!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ve buried my babies one by one,</line>
      <line>And dug the deep hole for Joan,</line>
      <line>And covered the faces of kith and kin,</line>
      <line>And felt the old churchyard-stone</line>
      <line>Go cold to my heart, full many a time –</line>
      <line>But I never felt so lone!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For the lion and Adam were company,</line>
      <line>And the tiger him beguiled;</line>
      <line>But the simple kind are foes to my life,</line>
      <line>And the household brutes are wild.</line>
      <line>If the veriest cur would lick my hand,</line>
      <line>I could love it like a child!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the beggar-man’s ghost besets my dreams</line>
      <line>At night, to make me madder,</line>
      <line>And my wretched conscience within my breast</line>
      <line>Is stinging like an adder –</line>
      <line> I sigh when I pass the gallows’ foot,</line>
      <line>And look at the rope and ladder!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For hanging looks sweet – but alas, in vain</line>
      <line>My desperate fancy begs;</line>
      <line>I must turn my cup of sorrows quite up,</line>
      <line>And drink it to the dregs,</line>
      <line>For there is not another man alive</line>
      <line>In the world, to pull my legs!</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And this he always kept in mind,</line>

      <line>To seek his mother’s life;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And as he ran to seek his mother</line>

      <line>A deed which is not common.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She soon grew pregnant, and brought forth</line>
      <line>Scurvy and Spotted Fever;</line>
      <line>The father grinned and skipped about,</line>

      <line> For now I have procured these imps,</line>

      <line>And stopped up all its vents,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the child began to swell</line>
      <line>He shouted out aloud,</line>

      <line>Shall do the world more good!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He took up Fever by the neck,</line>

      <line>He first discovered guts!</line>

    <title>The Idiot Boy</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis eight o’clock, a clear March night,</line>
      <line>The moon is up, the sky is blue,</line>
      <line>The owlet in the moonlight air</line>
      <line>He shouts from nobody knows where,</line>
      <line> He lengthens out his lonely shout,</line>
      <line>Halloo! Halloo! A long halloo!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why bustle thus about your door,</line>
      <line>What means this bustle, Betty Foy?</line>
      <line>Why are you in this mighty fret?</line>
      <line>And why on horseback have you set</line>
      <line>Him whom you love, your idiot boy?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beneath the moon that shines so bright,</line>
      <line>Till she is tired, let Betty Foy</line>
      <line>With girth and stirrup fiddle-faddle –</line>
      <line> But wherefore set upon a saddle</line>
      <line>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There’s scarce a soul that’s out of bed;</line>
      <line>Good Betty, put him down again!</line>
      <line>His lips with joy they burr at you,</line>
      <line>But Betty, what has he to do</line>
      <line>With stirrup, saddle, or with rein?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The world will say ’tis very idle,</line>
      <line>Bethink you of the time of night!</line>
      <line>There’s not a mother, no not one,</line>
      <line> But when she hears what you have done,</line>
      <line>Oh Betty she’ll be in a fright!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Betty’s bent on her intent,</line>
      <line>For her good neighbour, Susan Gale</line>
      <line>(Old Susan, she who dwells alone)</line>
      <line>Is sick, and makes a piteous moan</line>
      <line>As if her very life would fail.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There’s not a house within a mile,</line>
      <line>No hand to help them in distress;</line>
      <line>Old Susan lies abed in pain,</line>
      <line> And sorely puzzled are the twain,</line>
      <line>For what she ails they cannot guess.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty’s husband’s at the wood</line>
      <line>Where by the week he doth abide,</line>
      <line>A woodman in the distant vale;</line>
      <line>There’s none to help poor Susan Gale –</line>
      <line>What must be done, what will betide?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty from the lane has fetched</line>
      <line>Her pony that is mild and good</line>
      <line>Whether he be in joy or pain,</line>
      <line> Feeding at will along the lane</line>
      <line>Or bringing faggots from the wood.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he is all in travelling trim,</line>
      <line>And by the moonlight Betty Foy</line>
      <line>Has up upon the saddle set –</line>
      <line>The like was never heard of yet –</line>
      <line>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he must post without delay</line>
      <line>Across the bridge that’s in the dale,</line>
      <line>And by the church, and o’er the down,</line>
      <line> To bring a doctor from the town,</line>
      <line>Or she will die, old Susan Gale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There is no need of boot or spur,</line>
      <line>There is no need of whip or wand,</line>
      <line>For Johnny has his holly-bough,</line>
      <line>And with a hurly-burly now</line>
      <line>He shakes the green bough in his hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty o’er and o’er has told</line>
      <line>The boy who is her best delight,</line>
      <line>Both what to follow, what to shun,</line>
      <line> What do, and what to leave undone,</line>
      <line>How turn to left, and how to right.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty’s most especial charge</line>
      <line>Was, ‘Johnny! Johnny! mind that you</line>
      <line>Come home again, nor stop at all,</line>
      <line>Come home again, whate’er befall,</line>
      <line>My Johnny do, I pray you do.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To this did Johnny answer make</line>
      <line>Both with his head and with his hand,</line>
      <line>And proudly shook the bridle too;</line>
      <line> And then, his words were not a few,</line>
      <line>Which Betty well could understand!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now that Johnny is just going,</line>
      <line>Though Betty’s in a mighty flurry,</line>
      <line>She gently pats the pony’s side</line>
      <line>On which her idiot boy must ride,</line>
      <line>And seems no longer in a hurry.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when the pony moved his legs,</line>
      <line>Oh, then for the poor idiot boy! –</line>
      <line>For joy he cannot hold the bridle,</line>
      <line> For joy his head and heels are idle,</line>
      <line>He’s idle all for very joy!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And while the pony moves his legs,</line>
      <line>In Johnny’s left hand you may see</line>
      <line>The green bough’s motionless and dead;</line>
      <line>The moon that shines above his head</line>
      <line>Is not more still and mute than he.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His heart it was so full of glee</line>
      <line>That till full fifty yards were gone</line>
      <line>He quite forgot his holly whip</line>
      <line> And all his skill in horsemanship –</line>
      <line>Oh happy, happy, happy John!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty’s standing at the door,</line>
      <line>And Betty’s face with joy o’erflows –</line>
      <line>Proud of herself, and proud of him,</line>
      <line>OO She sees him in his travelling trim,</line>
      <line>How quietly her Johnny goes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The silence of her idiot boy,</line>
      <line>What hopes it sends to Betty’s heart!</line>
      <line>He’s at the guide-post – he turns right,</line>
      <line>She watches till he’s out of sight,</line>
      <line>And Betty will not then depart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Burr, burr – now Johnny’s lips they burr,</line>
      <line>As loud as any mill, or near it!</line>
      <line>Meek as a lamb the pony moves,</line>
      <line>And Johnny makes the noise he loves,</line>
      <line>And Betty listens, glad to hear it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away she hies to Susan Gale,</line>
      <line>And Johnny’s in a merry tune;</line>
      <line>The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,</line>
      <line> And Johnny’s lips they burr, burr, burr,</line>
      <line>And on he goes beneath the moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His steed and he right well agree,</line>
      <line>For of this pony there’s a rumour</line>
      <line>That should he lose his eyes and ears,</line>
      <line>And should he live a thousand years,</line>
      <line>He never will be out of humour.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But then he is a horse that thinks,</line>
      <line>And when he thinks his pace is slack!</line>
      <line>Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,</line>
      <line> Yet for his life he cannot tell</line>
      <line>What he has got upon his back.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So through the moonlight lanes they go,</line>
      <line>And far into the moonlight dale,</line>
      <line>And by the church, and o’er the down,</line>
      <line>To bring a doctor from the town,</line>
      <line>To comfort poor old Susan Gale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty, now at Susan’s side,</line>
      <line>Is in the middle of her story,</line>
      <line>What comfort Johnny soon will bring–</line>
      <line> With many a most diverting thing</line>
      <line>Of Johnny’s wit and Johnny’s glory.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty’s still at Susan’s side –</line>
      <line>By this time she’s not quite so flurried;</line>
      <line>Demure with porringer and plate</line>
      <line>She sits, as if in Susan’s fate</line>
      <line>Her life and soul were buried.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Betty, poor good woman, she</line>
      <line>(You plainly in her face may read it)</line>
      <line>Could lend out of that moment’s store</line>
      <line> Five years of happiness or more,</line>
      <line>To any that might need it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But yet I guess that now and then</line>
      <line>With Betty all was not so well;</line>
      <line>And to the road she turns her ears,</line>
      <line>And thence full many a sound she hears</line>
      <line>Which she to Susan will not tell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,</line>
      <line>‘As sure as there’s a moon in heaven’,</line>
      <line>Cries Betty, ‘he’ll be back again!</line>
      <line> They’ll both be here, ’tis almost ten –</line>
      <line>They’ll both be here before eleven.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,</line>
      <line>The clock gives warning for eleven –</line>
      <line>’Tis on the stroke! ‘If Johnny’s near’,</line>
      <line>Quoth Betty, ‘he will soon be here,</line>
      <line>As sure as there’s a moon in heaven.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The clock is on the stroke of twelve</line>
      <line>And Johnny is not yet in sight;</line>
      <line>The moon’s in heaven, as Betty sees,</line>
      <line> But Betty is not quite at ease –</line>
      <line>And Susan has a dreadful night!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty, half an hour ago,</line>
      <line>On Johnny vile reflections cast,</line>
      <line>‘A little idle sauntering thing!’</line>
      <line>With other names, an endless string,</line>
      <line>But now that time is gone and past.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty’s drooping at the heart,</line>
      <line>That happy time all past and gone,</line>
      <line>‘How can it be he is so late?</line>
      <line> The doctor he has made him wait –</line>
      <line>Susan, they’ll both be here anon.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Susan’s growing worse and worse,</line>
      <line>And Betty’s in a sad quandary –</line>
      <line>And then there’s nobody to say</line>
      <line>If she must go or she must stay;</line>
      <line>She’s in a sad quandary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The clock is on the stroke of one,</line>
      <line>But neither doctor nor his guide</line>
      <line>Appear along the moonlight road;</line>
      <line> There’s neither horse nor man abroad,</line>
      <line>And Betty’s still at Susan’s side.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Susan she begins to fear</line>
      <line>Of sad mischances not a few:</line>
      <line>That Johnny may perhaps be drowned,</line>
      <line>Or lost perhaps, and never found –</line>
      <line>Which they must both forever rue.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She prefaced half a hint of this</line>
      <line>With, ‘God forbid it should be true!’</line>
      <line>At the first word that Susan said</line>
      <line> Cried Betty, rising from the bed,</line>
      <line>‘Susan, I’d gladly stay with you!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I must be gone, I must away!</line>
      <line>Consider, Johnny’s but half-wise;</line>
      <line>Susan, we must take care of him.</line>
      <line>If he is hurt in life or limb’ –</line>
      <line>‘Oh God forbid!’ poor Susan cries.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘What can I do?’ says Betty, going,</line>
      <line>‘What can I do to ease your pain?</line>
      <line>Good Susan tell me, and I’ll stay;</line>
      <line>I fear you’re in a dreadful way,</line>
      <line>But I shall soon be back again.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Good Betty go, good Betty go,</line>
      <line>There’s nothing that can ease my pain’</line>
      <line>Then off she hies, but with a prayer</line>
      <line>That God poor Susan’s life would spare,</line>
      <line>Till she comes back again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So through the moonlight lane she goes,</line>
      <line>And far into the moonlight dale;</line>
      <line>And how she ran, and how she walked,</line>
      <line> And all that to herself she talked,</line>
      <line>Would surely be a tedious tale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In high and low, above, below,</line>
      <line>In great and small, in round and square,</line>
      <line>In tree and tower, was Johnny seen –</line>
      <line>In bush and brake, in black and green,</line>
      <line>’Twas Johnny, Johnny, everywhere.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She’s past the bridge that’s in the dale,</line>
      <line>And now the thought torments her sore,</line>
      <line>Johnny perhaps his horse forsook</line>
      <line> To hunt the moon that’s in the brook,</line>
      <line>And never will be heard of more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she’s high upon the down,</line>
      <line>Alone amid a prospect wide;</line>
      <line>There’s neither Johnny nor his horse</line>
      <line>Among the fern or in the gorse;</line>
      <line>There’s neither doctor nor his guide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh saints, what is become of him?</line>
      <line>Perhaps he’s climbed into an oak,</line>
      <line>Where he will stay till he is dead;</line>
      <line> Or sadly he has been misled,</line>
      <line>And joined the wandering gypsy-folk.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or him that wicked pony’s carried</line>
      <line>To the dark cave, the goblins’ hall,</line>
      <line>Or in the castle he’s pursuing,</line>
      <line>Among the ghosts, his own undoing;</line>
      <line>Or playing with the waterfall.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At poor old Susan then she railed</line>
      <line>While to the town she posts away,</line>
      <line>‘If Susan had not been so ill,</line>
      <line> Alas, I should have had him still,</line>
      <line>My Johnny, till my dying day.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Betty, in this sad distemper,</line>
      <line>The doctor’s self would hardly spare;</line>
      <line>Unworthy things she talked and wild –</line>
      <line>Even he, of cattle the most mild,</line>
      <line>The pony had his share.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she’s got into the town,</line>
      <line>And to the doctor’s door she hies;</line>
      <line>’Tis silence all on every side –</line>
      <line> The town so long, the town so wide,</line>
      <line>Is silent as the skies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she’s at the doctor’s door,</line>
      <line>She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap;</line>
      <line>The doctor at the casement shows</line>
      <line>His glimmering eyes that peep and doze,</line>
      <line>And one hand rubs his old nightcap.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh doctor, doctor, where’s my Johnny?’</line>
      <line>‘I’m here, what is’t you want with me?’</line>
      <line>‘Oh sir, you know I’m Betty Foy,</line>
      <line> And I have lost my poor dear boy!</line>
      <line>You know him, him you often see –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He’s not so wise as some folks be.’</line>
      <line>‘The Devil take his wisdom!’ said</line>
      <line>The doctor, looking somewhat grim;</line>
      <line>‘What, woman, should I know of him?’</line>
      <line>And, grumbling, he went back to bed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh woe is me! Oh woe is me!</line>
      <line>Here will I die, here will I die;</line>
      <line>I thought to find my Johnny here,</line>
      <line> But he is neither far nor near –</line>
      <line>Oh what a wretched mother I!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She stops, she stands, she looks about,</line>
      <line>Which way to turn she cannot tell.</line>
      <line>Poor Betty! It would ease her pain</line>
      <line>If she had heart to knock again;</line>
      <line>The clock strikes three – a dismal knell!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then up along the town she hies,</line>
      <line>No wonder if her senses fail,</line>
      <line>This piteous news so much it shocked her,</line>
      <line> She quite forgot to send the doctor,</line>
      <line>To comfort poor old Susan Gale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she’s high upon the down,</line>
      <line>And she can see a mile of road,</line>
      <line>‘Oh cruel! I’m almost three-score –</line>
      <line>Such night as this was ne’er before,</line>
      <line>There’s not a single soul abroad.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She listens, but she cannot hear</line>
      <line>The foot of horse, the voice of man;</line>
      <line>The streams with softest sound are flowing,</line>
      <line> The grass you almost hear it growing –</line>
      <line>You hear it now if e’er you can.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The owlets through the long blue night</line>
      <line>Are shouting to each other still –</line>
      <line>Fond lovers, yet not quite hob-nob,</line>
      <line>They lengthen out the tremulous sob</line>
      <line>That echoes far from hill to hill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Betty now has lost all hope,</line>
      <line>Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin;</line>
      <line>A green-grown pond she just has passed,</line>
      <line>And from the brink she hurries fast,</line>
      <line>Lest she should drown herself therein.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she sits her down and weeps –</line>
      <line>Such tears she never shed before –</line>
      <line>‘Oh dear, dear pony! My sweet joy!</line>
      <line>Oh carry back my idiot boy,</line>
      <line>And we will ne’er o’erload thee more!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A thought is come into her head:</line>
      <line>‘The pony he is mild and good,</line>
      <line>And we have always used him well;</line>
      <line> Perhaps he’s gone along the dell</line>
      <line>And carried Johnny to the wood.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then up she springs as if on wings,</line>
      <line>She thinks no more of deadly sin –</line>
      <line>If Betty fifty ponds should see,</line>
      <line>The last of all her thoughts would be</line>
      <line>To drown herself therein.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh reader, now that I might tell</line>
      <line>What Johnny and his horse are doing!</line>
      <line>What they’ve been doing all this time –</line>
      <line> Oh could I put it into rhyme,</line>
      <line>A most delightful tale pursuing!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Perhaps (and no unlikely thought!)</line>
      <line>He with his pony now doth roam</line>
      <line>The cliffs and peaks so high that are,</line>
      <line>To lay his hands upon a star,</line>
      <line>And in his pocket bring it home.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Perhaps he’s turned himself about,</line>
      <line>His face unto his horse’s tail,</line>
      <line>And still and mute, in wonder lost,</line>
      <line> All like a silent horseman-ghost</line>
      <line>He travels on along the vale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now perhaps he’s hunting sheep,</line>
      <line>A fierce and dreadful hunter he!</line>
      <line>Yon valley, that’s so trim and green,</line>
      <line>In five months’ time, should he be seen,</line>
      <line>A desert wilderness will be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Perhaps, with head and heels on fire</line>
      <line>And like the very soul of evil,</line>
      <line>He’s galloping away, away,</line>
      <line> And so he’ll gallop on for aye,</line>
      <line>The bane of all that dread the Devil.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I to the Muses have been bound,</line>
      <line>These fourteen years, by strong indentures;</line>
      <line>Oh gentle Muses, let me tell</line>
      <line>But half of what to him befell,</line>
      <line>For sure he met with strange adventures!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh gentle Muses, is this kind?</line>
      <line>Why will ye thus my suit repel?</line>
      <line>Why of your further aid bereave me?</line>
      <line> And can ye thus unfriended leave me,</line>
      <line>Ye Muses, whom I love so well?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who’s yon, that near the waterfall</line>
      <line>Which thunders down with headlong force</line>
      <line>Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,</line>
      <line>As careless as if nothing were,</line>
      <line>Sits upright on a feeding horse?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Unto his horse, that’s feeding free,</line>
      <line>He seems, I think, the rein to give;</line>
      <line>Of moon or stars he takes no heed</line>
      <line> (Of such we in romances read) –</line>
      <line>’Tis Johnny, Johnny, as I live!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And that’s the very pony too!</line>
      <line>Where is she, where is Betty Foy?</line>
      <line>She hardly can sustain her fears –</line>
      <line>The roaring waterfall she hears,</line>
      <line>And cannot find her idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Your pony’s worth his weight in gold;</line>
      <line>Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!</line>
      <line>She’s coming from among the trees,</line>
      <line> And now, all full in view, she sees</line>
      <line>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Betty sees the pony too!</line>
      <line>Why stand you thus good Betty Foy?</line>
      <line>It is no goblin, ’tis no ghost,</line>
      <line>’Tis he whom you so long have lost,</line>
      <line>He whom you love, your idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She looks again – her arms are up –</line>
      <line>She screams – she cannot move for joy!</line>
      <line>She darts as with a torrent’s force,</line>
      <line> She almost has o’erturned the horse,</line>
      <line>And fast she holds her idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Johnny burrs and laughs aloud –</line>
      <line>Whether in cunning or in joy</line>
      <line>I cannot tell, but while he laughs</line>
      <line>Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs</line>
      <line>To hear again her idiot boy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now she’s at the pony’s tail,</line>
      <line>And now she’s at the pony’s head,</line>
      <line>On that side now, and now on this;</line>
      <line> And, almost stifled with her bliss,</line>
      <line>A few sad tears does Betty shed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She kisses o’er and o’er again</line>
      <line>Him whom she loves, her idiot boy;</line>
      <line>She’s happy here, she’s happy there,</line>
      <line>She is uneasy everywhere –</line>
      <line>Her limbs are all alive with joy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She pats the pony, where or when</line>
      <line>She knows not, happy Betty Foy!</line>
      <line>The little pony glad may be,</line>
      <line>But he is milder far than she,</line>
      <line>You hardly can perceive his joy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh Johnny, never mind the doctor!</line>
      <line>You’ve done your best, and that is all.’</line>
      <line>She took the reins, when this was said,</line>
      <line>And gently turned the pony’s head</line>
      <line>From the loud waterfall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By this the stars were almost gone;</line>
      <line>The moon was setting on the hill,</line>
      <line>So pale you scarcely looked at her;</line>
      <line> The little birds began to stir,</line>
      <line>Though yet their tongues were still.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The pony, Betty, and her boy,</line>
      <line>Wind slowly through the woody dale:</line>
      <line>And who is she, betimes abroad,</line>
      <line>That hobbles up the steep rough road –</line>
      <line>Who is it, but old Susan Gale?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Long Susan lay deep lost in thought,</line>
      <line>And many dreadful fears beset her,</line>
      <line>Both for her messenger and nurse;</line>
      <line> And as her mind grew worse and worse,</line>
      <line>Her body it grew better.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She turned, she tossed herself, in bed –</line>
      <line>On all sides doubts and terrors met her;</line>
      <line>Point after point did she discuss,</line>
      <line>And while her mind was fighting thus,</line>
      <line>Her body still grew better.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Alas, what is become of them?</line>
      <line>These fears can never be endured –</line>
      <line>I’ll to the wood.’ The word scarce said,</line>
      <line> Did Susan rise up from her bed,</line>
      <line>As if by magic cured.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away she posts up hill and down,</line>
      <line>And to the wood at length is come;</line>
      <line>She spies her friends, she shouts a greeting –</line>
      <line>Oh me, it is a merry meeting</line>
      <line>As ever was in Christendom!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The owls have hardly sung their last</line>
      <line>While our four travellers homeward wend;</line>
      <line>The owls have hooted all night long –</line>
      <line> And with the owls began my song,</line>
      <line>And with the owls must end.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For while they all were travelling home,</line>
      <line>Cried Betty, ‘Tell us Johnny, do,</line>
      <line>Where all this long night you have been,</line>
      <line>What you have heard, what you have seen,</line>
      <line>And Johnny, mind you tell us true.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now Johnny all night long had heard</line>
      <line>The owls in tuneful concert strive;</line>
      <line>No doubt too he the moon had seen,</line>
      <line> For in the moonlight he had been</line>
      <line>From eight o’clock till five.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus to Betty’s question, he</line>
      <line>Made answer, like a traveller bold</line>
      <line>(His very words I give to you):</line>
      <line>‘The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,</line>
      <line>And the sun did shine so cold.’</line>
      <line>Thus answered Johnny in his glory,</line>
      <line>And that was all his travel’s story.</line>

    <title>from Peter Bell</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is it some party, in a parlour</line>
      <line>Crammed (just as they on earth were crammed),</line>
      <line>Some sipping punch, some sipping tea,</line>
      <line>But as you by their faces see,</line>
      <line> All silent and all damned?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis no such thing, I do assure you,</line>
      <line>Which Peter sees in the clear flood.</line>
      <line>It is no ugly apprehension</line>
      <line>Of eyes and ears, ’tis no invention –</line>
      <line>It is a thing of flesh and blood...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now poor Peter is convinced,</line>
      <line>While still he holds the ass’s head,</line>
      <line>That ’tis a fiend with visage wan,</line>
      <line>A live man-fiend, a living man,</line>
      <line> That’s lying in the river-bed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He looks, he looks, he looks again,</line>
      <line>He sees a motion, hears a groan;</line>
      <line>His eyes will burst, his heart will break,</line>
      <line>He gives a loud and dreadful shriek,</line>
      <line>And back he falls just like a stone...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He lifts his head, he sees his staff,</line>
      <line>He touches – ’tis to him a treasure!</line>
      <line>To find that he is not in Hell,</line>
      <line>As you’ll suppose to Peter Bell</line>
      <line> Doth give a sweet and languid pleasure.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And while upon his side he lies,</line>
      <line>His head upon his elbow raised,</line>
      <line>Almost you’d say as in a dream</line>
      <line>His eyes are settling on the stream</line>
      <line>Where he before had gazed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No dimple now disturbs the stream;</line>
      <line>In Peter’s brain there is no riot;</line>
      <line>His eye upon the stream he fixes,</line>
      <line>And with the sight no terror mixes,</line>
      <line>His heart is calm and quiet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Quoth he, ‘That is a dead man’s face</line>
      <line>Among the shadows of the trees!</line>
      <line>Those are no doubt a dead man’s knuckles,</line>
      <line>And there you see his brass shoe-buckles.</line>
      <line>And there his breeches’ knees.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At last he rises from his side,</line>
      <line>And sits upright upon the ground,</line>
      <line>And o’er the stream he hangs his nose</line>
      <line>And points his staff as you’d suppose</line>
      <line> The river’s depth to sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This sees the ass, while on the grass</line>
      <line>Close by the river’s brink he lies,</line>
      <line>And straight with a transition tragic,</line>
      <line>That seems just like the touch of magic,</line>
      <line>Up from the ground the ass doth rise.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At this friend Peter round him looks,</line>
      <line>And sees the poor and patient creature</line>
      <line>Close to him, in his uncouth way</line>
      <line>Expressing all the joy he may</line>
      <line> In every limb and feature.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His meagre bones all shake with joy,</line>
      <line>And close by Peter’s side he stands;</line>
      <line>While Peter o’er the river bends,</line>
      <line>The little ass his neck extends</line>
      <line>And fondly licks his hands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such life is in the ass’s eyes,</line>
      <line>Such life is in his limbs and ears,</line>
      <line>That Peter Bell, if he had been</line>
      <line>The veriest coward ever seen,</line>
      <line> Must now have thrown aside his fears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With caution Peter eyes the stream</line>
      <line>(The sapling deep and deeper goes);</line>
      <line>‘The body is no doubt’, quoth he,</line>
      <line>‘The thing which it appears to be –</line>
      <line>It moves not, neither limbs, nor clothes.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The ass looks on, and to his work</line>
      <line>Is Peter quietly resigned:</line>
      <line>He touches here, he touches there,</line>
      <line>And now among the dead man’s hair</line>
      <line> His sapling Peter has entwined.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He pulls, and pulls, and pulls again,</line>
      <line>And he whom the poor ass had lost –</line>
      <line>The man who had been four days dead –</line>
      <line>Head-foremost from the river’s bed</line>
      <line>Uprises like a ghost!</line>

    <title>We Are Seven</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A simple child, dear brother Jim,</line>
      <line>That lightly draws its breath,</line>
      <line>And feels its life in every limb,</line>
      <line>What should it know of death?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I met a little cottage-girl–</line>
      <line>She was eight years old, she said –</line>
      <line>Her hair was thick with many a curl</line>
      <line>That clustered round her head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She had a rustic, woodland air,</line>
      <line>And she was wildly clad;</line>
      <line>Her eyes were fair, and very fair –</line>
      <line>Her beauty made me glad.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Sisters and brothers, little maid,</line>
      <line>How many may you be?’</line>
      <line> ‘How many? Seven in all’, she said,</line>
      <line>And wondering looked at me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And where are they, I pray you tell?’</line>
      <line>She answered, ‘Seven are we,</line>
      <line>And two of us at Conway dwell,</line>
      <line>And two are gone to sea;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Two of us in the churchyard lie,</line>
      <line>My sister and my brother;</line>
      <line>And in the churchyard-cottage, I</line>
      <line>Dwell near them with my mother.’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> ‘You say that two at Conway dwell,</line>
      <line>And two are gone to sea,</line>
      <line>Yet you are seven – I pray you tell,</line>
      <line>Sweet maid, how this may be?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then did the little maid reply,</line>
      <line>‘Seven boys and girls are we –</line>
      <line>Two of us in the churchyard lie,</line>
      <line>Beneath the churchyard-tree.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘You run about, my little maid,</line>
      <line>Your limbs they are alive;</line>
      <line> If two are in the churchyard laid,</line>
      <line>Then ye are only five.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Their graves are green, they may be seen’,</line>
      <line>The little maid replied,</line>
      <line>‘Twelve steps or more from my mother’s door,</line>
      <line>And they are side by side.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My stockings there I often knit,</line>
      <line>My kerchief there I hem,</line>
      <line>And there upon the ground I sit,</line>
      <line>I sit and sing to them.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line> And often after sunset, sir,</line>
      <line>When it is light and fair,</line>
      <line>I take my little porringer</line>
      <line>And eat my supper there.</line>

      <line>The first that died was little Jane;</line>
      <line>In bed she moaning lay,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>So in the churchyard she was laid,</line>

      <line> Together round her grave we played,</line>
      <line>My brother John and I.</line>

    <title>The Devil’s Thoughts</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>From his brimstone bed at break of day</line>
      <line>A walking the Devil is gone,</line>
      <line>To visit his snug little farm the Earth,</line>
      <line>And see how his stock went on.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Over the hill and over the dale,</line>
      <line>And he went over the plain,</line>
      <line>And backward and forward he swished his long tail</line>
      <line>As a gentleman swishes his cane.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He saw a lawyer killing a viper</line>
      <line>On the dunghill beside his stable;</line>
      <line>‘Oh, oh!’, quoth he, for it put him in mind</line>
      <line>Of the story of Cain and Abel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>An apothecary on a white horse</line>
      <line>Rode by on his vocation,</line>
      <line> And the Devil thought of his old friend</line>
      <line>Death in the Revelation.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He went into a rich bookseller’s shop,</line>
      <line>Quoth he, ‘We are both of one college!</line>
      <line>For I sat myself, like a cormorant, once</line>
      <line>Upon the tree of knowledge.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He saw a turnkey in a trice</line>
      <line>Hand-cuff a troublesome blade;</line>
      <line>‘Nimbly,’ quoth he, ‘the fingers move</line>
      <line>If a man is but used to his trade.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He saw the same turnkey unfettering a man,</line>
      <line>With but little expedition,</line>
      <line>And he laughed for he thought of the long debates</line>
      <line>On the Slave-trade abolition.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As he went through [Cold-Bath] fields he looked</line>
      <line>At a solitary cell;</line>
      <line>And the Devil was pleased, for it gave him a hint</line>
      <line>For improving the prisons of Hell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He past a cottage with a double coach-house,</line>
      <line>A cottage of gentility;</line>
      <line> And he grinned at the sight, for his favourite vice</line>
      <line>Is pride that apes humility.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He saw a pig right rapidly</line>
      <line>Adown the river float,</line>
      <line>The pig swam well, but every stroke</line>
      <line>Was cutting his own throat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Old Nicholas grinned and swished his tail</line>
      <line>For joy and admiration;</line>
      <line>And he thought of his daughter, Victory,</line>
      <line>And his darling babe, Taxation.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He met an old acquaintance</line>
      <line>Just by the Methodist meeting –</line>
      <line>She held a consecrated flag,</line>
      <line>And the Devil nods a greeting.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She tipped him the wink, then frowned and cried,</line>
      <line>‘Avaunt! my name’s Religion’,</line>
      <line>And turned to Mr. W[ilberforce]</line>
      <line>And leered like a love-sick pigeon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>General [Gascoigne]’s burning face</line>
      <line>He saw with consternation,</line>
      <line> And back to Hell his way did take,</line>
      <line>For the Devil thought by a slight mistake</line>
      <line>It was general conflagration.</line>

    <title>Procrastination</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love will expire – the gay, the happy dream</line>
      <line>Will turn to scorn, indifference, or esteem.</line>
      <line>Some favoured pairs, in this exchange, are blest,</line>
      <line>Nor sigh for raptures in a state of rest;</line>
      <line> Others, ill-matched, with minds unpaired, repent</line>
      <line>At once the deed, and know no more content –</line>
      <line>From joy to anguish they in haste decline,</line>
      <line>And, with their fondness, their esteem resign.</line>
      <line>More luckless still their fate, who are the prey</line>
      <line>Of long-protracted hope and dull delay:</line>
      <line>Mid plans of bliss the heavy hours pass on,</line>
      <line>Till love is withered, and till joy is gone.</line>
      <line>This gentle flame two youthful hearts possessed,</line>
      <line>The sweet disturber of unenvied rest:</line>
      <line> The prudent Dinah was the maid beloved,</line>
      <line>And the kind Rupert was the swain approved.</line>
      <line>A wealthy aunt her gentle niece sustained,</line>
      <line>He, with a father, at his desk remained –</line>
      <line>The youthful couple, to their vows sincere,</line>
      <line>Thus loved expectant, year succeeding year,</line>
      <line>With pleasant views and hopes, but not a prospect near.</line>
      <line>Rupert some comfort in his station saw,</line>
      <line>But the poor virgin lived in dread and awe;</line>
      <line>Upon her anxious looks the widow smiled,</line>
      <line> And bade her wait, ‘for she was yet a child’.</line>
      <line>She for her neighbour had a due respect,</line>
      <line>Nor would his son encourage or reject;</line>
      <line>And thus the pair, with expectations vain,</line>
      <line>Beheld the seasons change and change again.</line>
      <line>Meantime the nymph her tender tales perused,</line>
      <line>Where cruel aunts impatient girls refused –</line>
      <line>While hers, though teasing, boasted to be kind,</line>
      <line>And she, resenting, to be all resigned!</line>
      <line>The dame was sick, and when the youth applied</line>
      <line> For her consent, she groaned, and coughed, and cried,</line>
      <line>Talked of departing, and again her breath</line>
      <line>Drew hard, and coughed, and talked again of death:</line>
      <line>‘Here you may live, my Dinah – here the boy</line>
      <line>And you together my estate enjoy!’</line>
      <line>Thus to the lovers was her mind expressed,</line>
      <line>Till they forbore to urge the fond request.</line>
      <line>Servant, and nurse, and comforter, and friend,</line>
      <line>Dinah had still some duty to attend –</line>
      <line>But yet their walk, when Rupert’s evening call</line>
      <line> Obtained an hour, made sweet amends for all.</line>
      <line>So long they now each other’s thoughts had known,</line>
      <line>That nothing seemed exclusively their own;</line>
      <line>But with the common wish, the mutual fear,</line>
      <line>They now had travelled to their thirtieth year.</line>
      <line>At length a prospect opened – but alas!</line>
      <line>Long time must yet, before the union, pass:</line>
      <line>Rupert was called, in other clime, to increase</line>
      <line>Another’s wealth, and toil for future peace.</line>
      <line>Loath were the lovers; but the aunt declared</line>
      <line> ’Twas fortune’s call, and they must be prepared:</line>
      <line>‘You now are young, and for this brief delay,</line>
      <line>And Dinah’s care, what I bequeath will pay –</line>
      <line>All will be yours! Nay, love, suppress that sigh!</line>
      <line>The kind must suffer, and the best must die!’</line>
      <line>Then came the cough, and strong the signs it gave</line>
      <line>Of holding long contention with the grave.</line>
      <line>The lovers parted with a gloomy view,</line>
      <line>And little comfort, but that both were true;</line>
      <line>He for uncertain duties doomed to steer,</line>
      <line> While hers remained too certain and severe.</line>
      <line>Letters arrived, and Rupert fairly told</line>
      <line>His cares were many, and his hopes were cold:</line>
      <line>The view more clouded, that was never fair,</line>
      <line>And love alone preserved him from despair –</line>
      <line>In other letters brighter hopes he drew,</line>
      <line>His friends were kind, and he believed them true!</line>
      <line>When the sage widow Dinah’s grief descried,</line>
      <line>She wondered much why one so happy sighed,</line>
      <line>Then bade her see how her poor aunt sustained</line>
      <line> The ills of life, nor murmured nor complained.</line>
      <line>To vary pleasures, from the lady’s chest</line>
      <line>Were drawn the pearly string and tabby vest,</line>
      <line>Beads, jewels, laces, all their value shown,</line>
      <line>With the kind notice – ‘They will be your own!’</line>
      <line>This hope, these comforts, cherished day by day,</line>
      <line>To Dinah’s bosom made a gradual way,</line>
      <line>Till love of treasure had as large a part</line>
      <line>As love of Rupert, in the virgin’s heart.</line>
      <line>Whether it be that tender passions fail,</line>
      <line> From their own nature, while the strong prevail;</line>
      <line>Or whether avarice, like the poison-tree,</line>
      <line>Kills all beside it, and alone will be –</line>
      <line>Whatever cause prevailed, the pleasure grew</line>
      <line>In Dinah’s soul: she loved the hoards to view;</line>
      <line>With lively joy those comforts she surveyed,</line>
      <line>And love grew languid in the careful maid.</line>
      <line>Now the grave niece partook the widow’s cares,</line>
      <line>Looked to the great, and ruled the small affairs;</line>
      <line>Saw cleaned the plate, arranged the china-show,</line>
      <line> And felt her passion for a shilling grow:</line>
      <line>The indulgent aunt increased the maid’s delight,</line>
      <line>By placing tokens of her wealth in sight;</line>
      <line>She loved the value of her bonds to tell,</line>
      <line>And spake of stocks, and how they rose and fell.</line>
      <line>This passion grew, and gained at length such sway</line>
      <line>That other passions shrank to make it way;</line>
      <line>Romantic notions now the heart forsook,</line>
      <line>She read but seldom, and she changed her book;</line>
      <line>And for the verses she was wont to send,</line>
      <line>Short was her prose – and she was Rupert’s friend.</line>
      <line>Seldom she wrote, and then the widow’s cough,</line>
      <line>And constant call, excused her breaking off;</line>
      <line>Who, now oppressed, no longer took the air,</line>
      <line>But sat and dozed upon an easy chair.</line>
      <line>The cautious doctor saw the case was clear,</line>
      <line>But judged it best to have companions near;</line>
      <line>They came, they reasoned, they prescribed – at last,</line>
      <line>Like honest men, they said their hopes were past!</line>
      <line>Then came a priest – ’tis comfort to reflect,</line>
      <line> When all is over, there was no neglect!</line>
      <line>And all was over: by her husband’s bones</line>
      <line>The widow rests beneath the sculptured stones</line>
      <line>That yet record their fondness and their fame;</line>
      <line>While all they left, the virgin’s care became –</line>
      <line>Stock, bonds, and buildings! It disturbed her rest</line>
      <line>To think what load of troubles she possessed;</line>
      <line>Yet, if a trouble, she resolved to take</line>
      <line>The important duty for the donor’s sake!</line>
      <line>She too was heiress to the widow’s taste,</line>
      <line> Her love of hoarding, and her dread of waste.</line>
      <line>Sometimes the past would on her mind intrude,</line>
      <line>And then a conflict full of care ensued:</line>
      <line>The thoughts of Rupert on her mind would press –</line>
      <line>His worth she knew, but doubted his success –</line>
      <line>Of old she saw him heedless: what the boy</line>
      <line>Forbore to save, the man would not enjoy.</line>
      <line>Oft had he lost the chance that care would seize,</line>
      <line>Willing to live, but more to live at ease –</line>
      <line>Yet could she not a broken vow defend,</line>
      <line> And Heaven, perhaps, might yet enrich her friend!</line>
      <line>Month after month was passed, and all were spent</line>
      <line>In quiet comfort and in rich content:</line>
      <line>Miseries there were, and woes the world around,</line>
      <line>But these had not her pleasant dwelling found;</line>
      <line>She knew that mothers grieved, and widows wept,</line>
      <line>And she was sorry, said her prayers, and slept!</line>
      <line>Thus passed the seasons, and to Dinah’s board</line>
      <line>Gave what the seasons to the rich afford;</line>
      <line>For she indulged – nor was her heart so small,</line>
      <line> That one strong passion should engross it all!</line>
      <line>A love of splendour now with avarice strove,</line>
      <line>And oft appeared to be the stronger love:</line>
      <line>A secret pleasure filled the Widow’s breast</line>
      <line>When she reflected on the hoards possessed,</line>
      <line>But livelier joy inspired the ambitious Maid</line>
      <line>When she the purchase of those hoards displayed.</line>
      <line>In small but splendid room she loved to see</line>
      <line>That all was placed in view and harmony;</line>
      <line>There, as with eager glance she looked around,</line>
      <line> She much delight in every object found;</line>
      <line>While books devout were near her – to destroy,</line>
      <line>Should it arise, an overflow of joy!</line>
      <line>Within that fair apartment guests might see</line>
      <line>The comforts culled for wealth by vanity:</line>
      <line>Around the room an Indian paper blazed,</line>
      <line>With lively tint and figures boldly raised;</line>
      <line>Silky and soft upon the floor below,</line>
      <line>The elastic carpet rose with crimson glow.</line>
      <line>All things around implied both cost and care –</line>
      <line> What met the eye was elegant or rare!</line>
      <line>Some curious trifles round the room were laid,</line>
      <line>By hope presented to the wealthy maid;</line>
      <line>Within a costly case of varnished wood,</line>
      <line>In level rows, her polished volumes stood</line>
      <line>(Shown as a favour to a chosen few,</line>
      <line>To prove what beauty for a book could do);</line>
      <line>A silver urn with curious work was fraught,</line>
      <line>A silver lamp from Grecian pattern wrought;</line>
      <line>Above her head, all gorgeous to behold,</line>
      <line> A timepiece stood on feet of burnished gold.</line>
      <line>A stag’s-head crest adorned the pictured case –</line>
      <line>Through the pure crystal shone the enamelled face –</line>
      <line>And while on brilliants moved the hands of steel,</line>
      <line>It clicked from prayer to prayer, from meal to meal.</line>
      <line>Here as the lady sat, a friendly pair</line>
      <line>Stepped in to admire the view, and took their chair –</line>
      <line>They then related how the young and gay</line>
      <line>Were thoughtless wandering in the broad highway,</line>
      <line>How tender damsels sailed in tilted boats</line>
      <line> And laughed with wicked men in scarlet coats,</line>
      <line>And how we live in such degenerate times</line>
      <line>That men conceal their wants, and show their crimes,</line>
      <line>While vicious deeds are screened by fashion’s name,</line>
      <line>And what was once our pride is now our shame.</line>
      <line>Dinah was musing, as her friends discoursed,</line>
      <line>When these last words a sudden entrance forced</line>
      <line>Upon her mind – and ‘what was once her pride</line>
      <line>And now her shame’ some painful views supplied.</line>
      <line>Thoughts of the past within her bosom pressed,</line>
      <line> And there a change was felt, and was confessed.</line>
      <line>While thus the virgin strove with secret pain,</line>
      <line>Her mind was wandering o’er the troubled main –</line>
      <line>Still she was silent, nothing seemed to see,</line>
      <line>But sat and sighed in pensive reverie.</line>
      <line>OO The friends prepared new subjects to begin –</line>
      <line>When tall Susannah, maiden starch, stalked in!</line>
      <line>Not in her ancient mode, sedate and slow,</line>
      <line>As when she came, the mind she knew, to know;</line>
      <line>Nor as, when listening half an hour before,</line>
      <line>She twice or thrice tapped gently at the door;</line>
      <line>But, all decorum cast in wrath aside,</line>
      <line>‘I think the devil’s in the man!’ she cried –</line>
      <line>‘A huge tall sailor, with his tawny cheek,</line>
      <line>And pitted face, will with my lady speak!</line>
      <line>He grinned an ugly smile, and said he knew,</line>
      <line>Please you, my lady, ’twould be joy to you –</line>
      <line>What must I answer?’ Trembling and distressed</line>
      <line>Sank the pale Dinah by her fears oppressed,</line>
      <line>When, thus alarmed, and brooking no delay,</line>
      <line>Swift to her room the stranger made his way.</line>
      <line> ‘Revive, my love’, said he, ‘I’ve done thee harm –</line>
      <line>Give me thy pardon!’ and he looked alarm.</line>
      <line>Meantime the prudent Dinah had contrived</line>
      <line>Her soul to question, and she then revived.</line>
      <line>‘See, my good friend’ – and then she raised her head –</line>
      <line>‘The bloom of life, the strength of youth is fled!</line>
      <line>Living we die – to us the world is dead!</line>
      <line>We parted blest with health, and I am now</line>
      <line>Age-struck and feeble – so I find art thou:</line>
      <line>Thine eye is sunken, furrowed is thy face,</line>
      <line> And downward lookst thou. So we run our race –</line>
      <line>And happier they whose race is nearly run,</line>
      <line>Their troubles over, and their duties done!’</line>
      <line>‘True, lady, true – we are not girl and boy,</line>
      <line>But time has left us something to enjoy.’</line>
      <line>‘What! thou hast learned my fortune? Yes, I live</line>
      <line>To feel how poor the comforts wealth can give!</line>
      <line>Thou too perhaps art wealthy – but our fate</line>
      <line>Still mocks our wishes! Wealth is come too late.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘To me, nor late nor early! I am come</line>
      <line> Poor as I left thee to my native home –</line>
      <line>Nor yet’, said Rupert, ‘will I grieve. ’Tis mine</line>
      <line>To share thy comforts, and the glory thine:</line>
      <line>For thou wilt gladly take that generous part</line>
      <line>That both exalts and gratifies the heart;</line>
      <line>While mine rejoices –’ ‘Heavens!’ returned the maid,</line>
      <line>‘This talk to one so withered and decayed?</line>
      <line>No! all my care is now to fit my mind</line>
      <line>For other spousal, and to die resigned.</line>
      <line>As friend and neighbour, I shall hope to see</line>
      <line> These noble views, this pious love, in thee –</line>
      <line>That we together may the change await</line>
      <line>(Guides and spectators in each other’s fate),</line>
      <line>When, fellow-pilgrims, we shall daily crave</line>
      <line>The mutual prayer that arms us for the grave!’</line>
      <line>Half angry, half in doubt, the lover gazed</line>
      <line>On the meek maiden, by her speech amazed:</line>
      <line>‘Dinah’, said he, ‘dost thou respect thy vows?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What spousal meanest thou? Thou art Rupert’s spouse!</line>
      <line>The chance is mine to take, and thine to give –</line>
      <line> But, trifling this, if we together live.</line>
      <line>Can I believe that after all the past,</line>
      <line>Our vows, our loves, thou wilt be false at last?</line>
      <line>Something thou hast – I know not what – in view:</line>
      <line>I find thee pious – let me find thee true!’</line>
      <line>‘Ah, cruel this – but do, my friend, depart,</line>
      <line>And to its feelings leave my wounded heart!’</line>
      <line>‘Nay, speak at once – and Dinah, let me know,</line>
      <line>Meanest thou to take me, now I’m wrecked, in tow?</line>
      <line>Be fair; nor longer keep me in the dark –</line>
      <line> Am I forsaken for a trimmer spark?</line>
      <line>Heaven’s spouse thou art not; nor can I believe</line>
      <line>That God accepts her who will man deceive!</line>
      <line>True I am shattered – I have service seen,</line>
      <line>And service done, and have in trouble been!</line>
      <line>My cheek (it shames me not) has lost its red,</line>
      <line>And the brown buff is o’er my features spread.</line>
      <line>Perchance my speech is rude, for I among</line>
      <line>The untamed have been, in temper and in tongue –</line>
      <line>Have been trepanned, have lived in toil and care,</line>
      <line> And wrought for wealth I was not doomed to share.</line>
      <line>It touched me deeply, for I felt a pride</line>
      <line>In gaining riches for my destined bride!</line>
      <line>Speak then my fate. For these my sorrows past,</line>
      <line>Time lost, youth fled, hope wearied, and at last</line>
      <line>This doubt of thee (a childish thing to tell,</line>
      <line>But certain truth) – my very throat they swell;</line>
      <line>They stop the breath, and but for shame could I</line>
      <line>Give way to weakness, and with passion cry.</line>
      <line>These are unmanly struggles, but I feel</line>
      <line> This hour must end them – and perhaps will heal.’</line>
      <line>Here Dinah sighed, as if afraid to speak,</line>
      <line>And then repeated – they were frail and weak;</line>
      <line>His soul she loved, and hoped he had the grace</line>
      <line>To fix his thoughts upon a better place.</line>
      <line>She ceased. With steady glance, as if to see</line>
      <line>The very root of this hypocrisy,</line>
      <line>He her small fingers moulded in his hard</line>
      <line>And bronzed broad hand – then told her his regard,</line>
      <line>His best respect were gone, but love had still</line>
      <line> Hold in his heart, and governed yet the will,</line>
      <line>Or he would curse her. Saying this, he threw</line>
      <line>The hand in scorn away, and bade adieu</line>
      <line>To every lingering hope, with every care in view.</line>
      <line>Proud and indignant, suffering, sick, and poor,</line>
      <line>He grieved unseen, and spoke of love no more –</line>
      <line>Till all he felt in indignation died,</line>
      <line>As hers had sunk in avarice and pride.</line>
      <line>In health declining, as in mind distressed,</line>
      <line>To some in power his troubles he confessed,</line>
      <line>And shares a parish-gift. At prayers he sees</line>
      <line>The pious Dinah dropped upon her knees;</line>
      <line>Thence as she walks the street with stately air</line>
      <line>As chance directs, oft meet the parted pair.</line>
      <line>When he, with thickset coat of badge-man’s blue,</line>
      <line>Moves near her shaded silk of changeful hue;</line>
      <line>When his thin locks of gray approach her braid</line>
      <line>(A costly purchase made in beauty’s aid);</line>
      <line>When his frank air, and his unstudied pace,</line>
      <line>Are seen with her soft manner, air, and grace,</line>
      <line> And his plain artless look with her sharp meaning face;</line>
      <line>It might some wonder in a stranger move,</line>
      <line>How these together could have talked of love.</line>
      <line>Behold them now! See there a tradesman stands,</line>
      <line>And humbly hearkens to some fresh commands.</line>
      <line>He moves to speak, she interrupts him: ‘Stay!’</line>
      <line>Her air expresses – ‘Hark to what I say!’</line>
      <line>Ten paces off, poor Rupert on a seat</line>
      <line>Has taken refuge from the noonday heat,</line>
      <line>His eyes on her intent, as if to find</line>
      <line> What were the movements of that subtle mind.</line>
      <line>How still, how earnest is he! It appears</line>
      <line>His thoughts are wandering through his earlier years –</line>
      <line>Through years of fruitless labour, to the day</line>
      <line>When all his earthly prospects died away:</line>
      <line>‘Had I’, he thinks, ‘been wealthier of the two,</line>
      <line>Would she have found me so unkind, untrue?</line>
      <line>Or knows not man when poor, what man when rich will do?</line>
      <line>Yes, yes! I feel that I had faithful proved,</line>
      <line>And should have soothed and raised her, blest and loved!’</line>
      <line> But Dinah moves – she had observed before,</line>
      <line>The pensive Rupert at an humble door.</line>
      <line>Some thoughts of pity raised by his distress,</line>
      <line>Some feeling touch of ancient tenderness;</line>
      <line>Religion, duty, urged the maid to speak,</line>
      <line>In terms of kindness to a man so weak;</line>
      <line>But pride forbade – and to return would prove</line>
      <line>She felt the shame of his neglected love.</line>
      <line>Nor wrapped in silence could she pass, afraid</line>
      <line>Each eye should see her, and each heart upbraid.</line>
      <line> One way remained – the way the Levite took,</line>
      <line>Who without mercy could on misery look</line>
      <line>(A way perceived by craft, approved by pride),</line>
      <line>She crossed and passed him on the other side.</line>

      <line>‘My brother Jack was nine in May,</line>
      <line>And I was eight on New Year’s Day;</line>
      <line>So in Kate Wilson’s shop</line>
      <line>Papa (he’s my papa and Jack’s)</line>
      <line> Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,</line>
      <line>And brother Jack a top.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Jack’s in the pouts, and this it is –</line>
      <line>He thinks mine came to more than his;</line>
      <line>So to my drawer he goes,</line>
      <line>Takes out the doll, and, O, my stars!</line>
      <line>He pokes her head between the bars,</line>
      <line>And melts off half her nose!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Quite cross, a bit of string I beg,</line>
      <line>And tie it to his peg-top’s peg,</line>
      <line> And bang, with might and main,</line>
      <line>Its head against the parlour-door:</line>
      <line>Off flies the head, and hits the floor,</line>
      <line>And breaks a window-pane.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This made him cry with rage and spite:</line>
      <line>Well, let him cry, it serves him right.</line>
      <line>A pretty thing, forsooth!</line>
      <line>If he’s to melt, all scalding hot,</line>
      <line>Half my doll’s nose, and I am not</line>

      <line> Aunt Hannah heard the window break,</line>

      <line>Thus to distress your aunt:</line>
      <line>No Drury-Lane for you to-day!”</line>
      <line>And while papa said, “Pooh, she may!”</line>
      <line>Mamma said, “No, she shan’t!”</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well, after many a sad reproach,</line>
      <line>They got into a hackney coach,</line>
      <line>And trotted down the street.</line>
      <line>I saw them go: one horse was blind,</line>
      <line> The tails of both hung down behind,</line>
      <line>Their shoes were on their feet.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The chaise in which poor brother Bill</line>
      <line>Used to be drawn to Pentonville,</line>

      <line>I wiped the dust from off the top,</line>
      <line>While Molly mopped it with a mop,</line>

      <line>My uncle’s porter, Samuel Hughes,</line>
      <line>Came in at six to black the shoes</line>

      <line>So what does he, but takes, and drags</line>
      <line>Me in the chaise along the flags,</line>
      <line>And leaves me where I am.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My father’s walls are made of brick,</line>

      <line>As these; and, goodness me!</line>
      <line>My father’s beams are made of wood,</line>
      <line>But never, never half so good</line>
      <line>As those that now I see.</line>

      <line> What a large floor! ’tis like a town!</line>
      <line>The carpet when they lay it down,</line>

      <line>And there’s a row of lamps! – my eye!</line>

      <line>They keep them on the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At first I caught hold of the wing,</line>
      <line>And kept away; but Mr. Thingumbob,</line>
      <line>the prompter man,</line>
      <line>Gave with his hand my chaise a shove,</line>
      <line> And said, “Go on, my pretty love;</line>

      <line>You’ve only got to curtsy, whisper,</line>

      <line>They smile, they nod; I’ll go my ways,</line>

      <line>To join them in the pit.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now, good gentle-folks, I go</line>
      <line>To join mamma, and see the show;</line>
      <line>So, bidding you adieu,</line>
      <line>I curtsy, like a pretty miss,</line>

      <line>I’ll blow a kiss to you.’</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>On Tuesday morn, at half past six o’clock,</line>
      <line>I rose and dressed myself, and having shut</line>
      <line>The door o’ the bedroom still and leisurely,</line>
      <line>I walked down stairs. When at the outer door</line>
      <line> I firmly grasped the key, that ere night-fall</line>
      <line>Had turned the lock into its wonted niche</line>
      <line>Within the brazen implement, that shone</line>
      <line>With no unseemly splendour – mellowed light</line>
      <line>Elicited by touch of careful hand</line>
      <line>On the brown lintel – and the obedient door</line>
      <line>(As at a potent necromancer’s touch)</line>
      <line>Into the air receded suddenly,</line>
      <line>And gave wide prospect of the sparkling lake,</line>
      <line>Just then emerging from the snow-white mist</line>
      <line> Like angel’s veil slow-folded up to Heaven.</line>
      <line>And lo! a vision bright and beautiful</line>
      <line>Sheds a refulgent glory o’er the sand –</line>
      <line>The sand and glory of my avenue,</line>
      <line>For, standing silent by the kitchen-door</line>
      <line>(Tinged by the morning sun, and in its own</line>
      <line>Brown natural hide most lovely, two long ears</line>
      <line>Upstretching perpendicularly, then</line>
      <line>With the horizon levelled – to my gaze</line>
      <line>Superb as horn of fabled unicorn –</line>
      <line> Each in its own proportions grander far</line>
      <line>Than the frontal glory of that wandering beast,</line>
      <line>Child of the desert), lo! a beauteous ass,</line>
      <line>With panniers hanging silent at each side,</line>
      <line>Silent as cage of bird whose song is mute –</line>
      <line>Though silent yet not empty – filled with bread,</line>
      <line>The staff of life, the means by which the soul</line>
      <line>(By fate obedient to the powers of sense)</line>
      <line>Renews its faded vigour, and keeps up</line>
      <line>A proud communion with the external heavens.</line>
      <line> Fastened to a ring it stood, while at its head</line>
      <line>A boy of six years old, an angel bright,</line>
      <line>Patted its neck, and to its mouth applied</line>
      <line>The harmless thistle that his hand had plucked</line>
      <line>From the wild common, melancholy crop!</line>
      <line>Not undelightful was that simple sight,</line>
      <line>For I at once did recognize that ass</line>
      <line>To be the property of one James Rigg...</line>

      <line>Can there be a moon in heaven tonight,</line>
      <line>That the hill and gray cloud seem so light?</line>
      <line>The air is whitened by some spell,</line>
      <line>For there is no moon, I know it well;</line>
      <line> On this third day the sages say –</line>

      <line>Bright somewhere in a heaven below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is a strange and lovely night,</line>
      <line>A grayish pale, but not white!</line>
      <line>Is it rain, or is it dew,</line>
      <line>That falls so thick I see its hue?</line>
      <line>In rays it follows, one, two, three,</line>
      <line>Down the air so merrily;</line>

      <line>Why does the Lady Isabelle</line>
      <line>Sit in the damp and dewy dell</line>
      <line>Counting the racks of drizzly rain?</line>
      <line>And how often the rail cries over again,</line>
      <line>For she’s harping, harping, in the brake,</line>
      <line>‘Craik, craik, craik, craik’ –</line>
      <line>Ten times nine, and thrice eleven;</line>
      <line>That last call was an hundred and seven!</line>
      <line>‘Craik, craik, the hour is near!’</line>
      <line> Let it come, I have no fear –</line>
      <line>Yet it is a dreadful work, I wis,</line>
      <line>Such doings in a night like this!</line>
      <line>Sounds the river harsh and loud?</line>
      <line>The stream sounds harsh, but not loud.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There is a cloud that seems to hover</line>
      <line>By western hill the churchyard over –</line>
      <line>What is it like? ’Tis like a whale!</line>
      <line>’Tis like a shark with half the tail –</line>
      <line>Not half, but a third and more –</line>
      <line> Now ’tis a wolf, and now a boar;</line>
      <line>Its face is raised, it cometh here –</line>
      <line>Let it come, there is no fear!</line>
      <line>There’s two for Heaven, and ten for Hell –</line>

      <line>If every stanza brings us in a crown,</line>

      <line>A bedroom and front parlour for next week.</line>

      <line>Tell me, my dear Thalia, what you think –</line>

      <line>By Monday next I’ll compass a new pair –</line>
      <line>Come now, fling up the cinders, fetch the coals,</line>
      <line>And take away the things you hung to air;</line>
      <line>Set out the tea-things, and bid Phoebe bring</line>
      <line>The kettle up – Arms and the Monks I sing!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Some ten miles off an ancient Abbey stood</line>
      <line>Amidst the mountains, near a noble stream –</line>
      <line>A level eminence, enshrined with wood,</line>
      <line>Sloped to the river’s bank and southern beam.</line>
      <line>Within were fifty friars fat and good,</line>
      <line>Of goodly persons, and of good esteem,</line>
      <line>That passed an easy, exemplary life,</line>
      <line>Remote from want and care and worldly strife.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Between the Monks and Giants there subsisted</line>
      <line>In the first Abbot’s lifetime much respect;</line>
      <line> The Giants let them settle where they listed –</line>
      <line>The Giants were a tolerating sect!</line>
      <line>A poor lame Giant once the Monks assisted:</line>
      <line>Old and abandoned, dying with neglect,</line>
      <line>The Prior found him, cured his broken bone,</line>
      <line>And very kindly cut him for the stone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This seemed a glorious, golden opportunity</line>
      <line>To civilize the whole gigantic race;</line>
      <line>To draw them to pay tithes and dwell in unity;</line>
      <line>The Giant’s valley was a fertile place,</line>
      <line> And might have much enriched the whole community</line>
      <line>Had the old Giant lived a longer space –</line>
      <line>But he relapsed, and though all means were tried,</line>
      <line>They could but just baptize him – when he died.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I believe the Giants never knew</line>
      <line>Of the kind treatment that befell their mate</line>
      <line>(He broke down all at once, and all the crew</line>
      <line>Had taken leave, and left him to his fate),</line>
      <line>And though the Monks exposed him full in view,</line>
      <line>Propped on his crutches at the garden-gate</line>
      <line> To prove their cure, and show that all was right,</line>
      <line>It happened that no Giants came in sight…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In castles and in courts Ambition dwells,</line>
      <line>But not in castles or in courts alone;</line>
      <line> She breathed a wish, throughout those sacred cells,</line>
      <line>For bells of larger size, and louder tone.</line>
      <line>Giants abominate the sound of bells,</line>
      <line>And soon the fierce antipathy was shown –</line>
      <line>The tinkling and the jingling and the clangour</line>
      <line>Roused their irrational gigantic anger!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Unhappy mortals, ever blind to fate!</line>
      <line>Unhappy Monks, you see no danger nigh!</line>
      <line>Exulting in their sound and size and weight,</line>
      <line>From morn till noon the merry peal you ply:</line>
      <line> The belfry rocks, your bosoms are elate,</line>
      <line>Your spirits with the ropes and pulleys fly –</line>
      <line>Tired, but transported, panting, pulling, hauling,</line>
      <line>Ramping and stamping, overjoyed and bawling.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Meanwhile the solemn mountains that surrounded</line>
      <line>The silent valley where the Convent lay,</line>
      <line>With tintinabular uproar were astounded,</line>
      <line>When the first peal burst forth at break of day:</line>
      <line>Feeling their granite ears severely wounded,</line>
      <line>They scarce knew what to think, or what to say,</line>
      <line> And – though large mountains commonly conceal</line>
      <line>Their sentiments, dissembling what they feel –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet Cader-Gibbrish from his cloudy throne</line>
      <line>To huge Loblommon gave an intimation</line>
      <line>Of this strange rumour, with an awful tone</line>
      <line>Thundering his deep surprise and indignation.</line>
      <line>The lesser hills, in language of their own,</line>
      <line>Discussed the topic by reverberation,</line>
      <line>Discoursing with their echoes all day long –</line>
      <line>Their only conversation was, ‘ding-dong’!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Those giant-mountains inwardly were moved,</line>
      <line>But never made an outward change of place:</line>
      <line>Not so the mountain-giants – as behoved</line>
      <line>A more alert and locomotive race –</line>
      <line>Hearing a clatter which they disapproved,</line>
      <line>They ran straight forward to besiege the place</line>
      <line>With a discordant universal yell,</line>
      <line>Like house-dog howling at a dinner-bell.</line>

    <title>Old Meg She Was a Gypsy</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Old Meg she was a gypsy,</line>
      <line>And lived upon the moors,</line>
      <line>Her bed it was the brown heath-turf,</line>
      <line>And her house was out-of-doors.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Her apples were swart blackberries,</line>
      <line>Her currants pods o’ broom,</line>
      <line>Her wine was dew of the white wild rose,</line>
      <line>Her book a churchyard tomb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her brothers were the craggy hills,</line>
      <line>Her sisters larchen trees –</line>
      <line>Alone with her great family</line>
      <line>She lived as she did please.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No breakfast had she many a morn,</line>
      <line>No dinner many a noon,</line>
      <line> And ‘stead of supper she would stare</line>
      <line>Full hard against the moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For every morn, of woodbine fresh</line>
      <line>She made a garlanding,</line>
      <line>And every night the dark glen yew</line>
      <line>She wove – and she would sing!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And with her fingers old and brown</line>
      <line>She plaited mats o’ rushes,</line>
      <line>And gave them to the cottagers</line>
      <line>She met among the bushes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Old Meg she was brave as Margaret Queen</line>
      <line>And tall as Amazon,</line>
      <line>An old red blanket-cloak she wore,</line>
      <line>A chip-hat had she on –</line>
      <line>God rest her agéd bones somewhere,</line>
      <line>She died full long agone!</line>

    <title>Peter Bell the Third (IV)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lo, Peter in Hell’s Grosvenor Square,</line>
      <line>A footman in the Devil’s service!</line>
      <line>And the misjudging world would swear</line>
      <line>That every man in service there</line>
      <line> To virtue would prefer vice.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Peter, though now damned, was not</line>
      <line>What Peter was before damnation:</line>
      <line>Men oftentimes prepare a lot</line>
      <line>Which, ere it finds them, is not what</line>
      <line>Suits with their genuine station.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All things that Peter saw and felt</line>
      <line>Had a peculiar aspect to him;</line>
      <line>And when they came within the belt</line>
      <line>Of his own nature, seemed to melt,</line>
      <line> Like cloud to cloud, into him.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And so the outward world uniting</line>
      <line>To that within him, he became</line>
      <line>Considerably uninviting</line>
      <line>To those who, meditation slighting,</line>
      <line>Were moulded in a different frame.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he scorned them, and they scorned him!</line>
      <line>And he scorned all they did – and they</line>
      <line>Did all that men of their own trim</line>
      <line>Are wont to do to please their whim,</line>
      <line> Drinking, lying, swearing, play.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such were his fellow-servants – thus</line>
      <line>His virtue, like our own, was built</line>
      <line>Too much on that indignant fuss</line>
      <line>Hypocrite pride stirs up in us</line>
      <line>To bully one another’s guilt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had a mind which was somehow</line>
      <line>At once circumference and centre</line>
      <line>Of all he might or feel or know –</line>
      <line>Nothing went ever out, although</line>
      <line> Something did ever enter.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had as much imagination</line>
      <line>As a pint-pot – he never could</line>
      <line>Fancy another situation,</line>
      <line>From which to dart his contemplation,</line>
      <line>Than that wherein he stood!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet his was individual mind,</line>
      <line>And new created all he saw</line>
      <line>In a new manner, and refined</line>
      <line>Those new creations, and combined</line>
      <line> Them, by a master-spirit’s law.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus, though unimaginative,</line>
      <line>An apprehension clear, intense,</line>
      <line>Of his mind’s work, had made alive</line>
      <line>The things it wrought on – I believe</line>
      <line>Wakening a sort of thought in sense.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But from the first ’twas Peter’s drift</line>
      <line>To be a kind of moral eunuch,</line>
      <line>He touched the hem of Nature’s shift,</line>
      <line>Felt faint – and never dared uplift</line>
      <line> The closest, all-concealing tunic!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She laughed the while, with an arch smile,</line>
      <line>And kissed him with a sister’s kiss,</line>
      <line>And said: ‘My best Diogenes,</line>
      <line>I love you well, but, if you please,</line>
      <line>Tempt not again my deepest bliss!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis you are cold – for I, not coy,</line>
      <line>Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;</line>
      <line>And Burns, a Scottish peasant-boy –</line>
      <line>His errors prove it – knew my joy</line>
      <line> More, learnéd friend, than you...</line>

    <title>Don Juan (I)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line> Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,</line>
      <line>Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit; he seemed</line>
      <line>Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;</line>
      <line>And everybody but his mother deemed</line>
      <line>Him almost man; but she flew in a rage</line>
      <line>And bit her lips (for else she might have screamed)</line>
      <line>If any said so, for to be precocious</line>
      <line>Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all</line>
      <line>Selected for discretion and devotion,</line>
      <line> There was the Donna Julia, whom to call</line>
      <line>Pretty were but to give a feeble notion</line>
      <line>Of many charms in her as natural</line>
      <line>As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,</line>
      <line>Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid</line>
      <line>(But this last simile is trite and stupid).</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The darkness of her oriental eye</line>
      <line>Accorded with her Moorish origin.</line>
      <line>Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by</line>
      <line>(In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin):</line>
      <line> When proud Grenada fell, and, forced to fly,</line>
      <line>Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia’s kin</line>
      <line>Some went to Africa, some stayed in Spain –</line>
      <line>Her great great grandmamma chose to remain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She married (I forget the pedigree)</line>
      <line>With an hidalgo, who transmitted down</line>
      <line>His blood less noble than such blood should be;</line>
      <line>At such alliances his sires would frown,</line>
      <line>In that point so precise in each degree</line>
      <line>That they bred in and in, as might be shown,</line>
      <line> Marrying their cousins – nay, their aunts and nieces,</line>
      <line>Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This heathenish cross restored the breed again,</line>
      <line>Ruined its blood, but much improved its flesh;</line>
      <line>For, from a root the ugliest in old Spain</line>
      <line>Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;</line>
      <line>The sons no more were short, the daughters plain –</line>
      <line>But there’s a rumour which I fain would hush:</line>
      <line>’Tis said that Donna Julia’s grandmamma</line>
      <line>Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> However this might be, the race went on</line>
      <line>Improving still through every generation,</line>
      <line>Until it centered in an only son,</line>
      <line>Who left an only daughter; my narration</line>
      <line>May have suggested that this single one</line>
      <line>Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion</line>
      <line>I shall have much to speak about), and she</line>
      <line>Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her eye (I’m very fond of handsome eyes)</line>
      <line>Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire</line>
      <line> Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise</line>
      <line>Flashed an expression more of pride than ire,</line>
      <line>And love than either; and there would arise</line>
      <line>A something in them which was not desire,</line>
      <line>But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul</line>
      <line>Which struggled through and chastened down the whole.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her glossy hair was clustered o’er a brow</line>
      <line>Bright with intelligence, and fair and smooth;</line>
      <line>Her eyebrow’s shape was like the aerial bow,</line>
      <line>Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,</line>
      <line> Mounting, at times, to a transparent glow,</line>
      <line>As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,</line>
      <line>Possessed an air and grace by no means common,</line>
      <line>Her stature tall – I hate a dumpy woman.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wedded she was some years, and to a man</line>
      <line>Of fifty – and such husbands are in plenty –</line>
      <line>And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE</line>
      <line>’Twere better to have TWO of five and twenty,</line>
      <line>Especially in countries near the sun:</line>
      <line>And now I think on’t, mi vien in mente,</line>
      <line> Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue</line>
      <line>Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,</line>
      <line>And all the fault of that indecent sun</line>
      <line>Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay</line>
      <line>But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,</line>
      <line>That howsoever people fast and pray</line>
      <line>The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:</line>
      <line>What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,</line>
      <line>Is much more common where the climate’s sultry.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Happy the nations of the moral north!</line>
      <line>Where all is virtue, and the winter season</line>
      <line>Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth</line>
      <line>(’Twas snow that brought St Anthony to reason);</line>
      <line>Where juries cast up what a wife is worth</line>
      <line>By laying whate’er sum, in mulct, they please on</line>
      <line>The lover, who must pay a handsome price</line>
      <line>Because it is a marketable vice.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alfonso was the name of Julia’s lord,</line>
      <line>A man well looking for his years, and who</line>
      <line> Was neither much beloved, nor yet abhorred;</line>
      <line>They lived together as most people do,</line>
      <line>Suffering each other’s foibles by accord,</line>
      <line>And not exactly either one or two;</line>
      <line>Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,</line>
      <line>For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Julia was – yet I never could see why –</line>
      <line>With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;</line>
      <line>Between their tastes there was small sympathy,</line>
      <line>For not a line had Julia ever penned.</line>
      <line> Some people whisper (but, no doubt, they lie,</line>
      <line>For malice still imputes some private end)</line>
      <line>That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso’s marriage,</line>
      <line>Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And that, still keeping up the old connection,</line>
      <line>Which time had lately rendered much more chaste,</line>
      <line>She took his lady also in affection.</line>
      <line>And certainly this course was much the best:</line>
      <line>She flattered Julia with her sage protection,</line>
      <line>And complimented Don Alfonso’s taste;</line>
      <line> And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,</line>
      <line>At least she left it a more slender handle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I can’t tell whether Julia saw the affair</line>
      <line>With other people’s eyes, or if her own</line>
      <line>Discoveries made, but none could be aware</line>
      <line>Of this, at least no symptom e’er was shown;</line>
      <line>Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,</line>
      <line>Indifferent from the first, or callous grown:</line>
      <line>I’m really puzzled what to think or say,</line>
      <line>She kept her counsel in so close a way.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,</line>
      <line>Caressed him often, such a thing might be</line>
      <line>Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,</line>
      <line>When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;</line>
      <line>But I am not so sure I should have smiled</line>
      <line>When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three,</line>
      <line>These few short years make wondrous alterations,</line>
      <line>Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Whate’er the cause might be, they had become</line>
      <line>Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,</line>
      <line> Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,</line>
      <line>And much embarrassment in either eye.</line>
      <line>There surely will be little doubt with some</line>
      <line>That Donna Julia knew the reason why,</line>
      <line>But as for Juan, he had no more notion</line>
      <line>Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet Julia’s very coldness still was kind,</line>
      <line>And tremulously gentle her small hand</line>
      <line>Withdrew itself from his, but left behind</line>
      <line>A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland</line>
      <line> And slight, so very slight, that to the mind</line>
      <line>’Twas but a doubt; but ne’er magician’s wand</line>
      <line>Wrought change with all Armida’s fairy art</line>
      <line>Like what this light touch left on Juan’s heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if she met him, though she smiled no more,</line>
      <line>She looked a sadness sweeter than her smile,</line>
      <line>As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store</line>
      <line>She must not own, but cherished more the while</line>
      <line>For that compression in its burning core.</line>
      <line>Even innocence itself has many a wile,</line>
      <line> And will not dare to trust itself with truth –</line>
      <line>And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But passion most dissembles yet betrays</line>
      <line>Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky</line>
      <line>Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays</line>
      <line>Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,</line>
      <line>And in whatever aspect it arrays</line>
      <line>Itself, ’tis still the same hypocrisy;</line>
      <line>Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,</line>
      <line>Are masks it often wears, and still too late.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,</line>
      <line>And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,</line>
      <line>And burning blushes, though for no transgression,</line>
      <line>Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;</line>
      <line>All these are little preludes to possession,</line>
      <line>Of which young passion cannot be bereft,</line>
      <line>And merely tend to show how greatly love is</line>
      <line>Embarrassed at first starting with a novice.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Julia’s heart was in an awkward state;</line>
      <line>She felt it going, and resolved to make</line>
      <line> The noblest efforts for herself and mate,</line>
      <line>For honour’s, pride’s, religion’s, virtue’s sake;</line>
      <line>Her resolutions were most truly great,</line>
      <line>And almost might have made a Tarquin quake;</line>
      <line>She prayed the Virgin Mary for her grace,</line>
      <line>As being the best judge of a lady’s case.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She vowed she never would see Juan more,</line>
      <line>And next day paid a visit to his mother,</line>
      <line>And looked extremely at the opening door,</line>
      <line>Which, by the Virgin’s grace, let in another;</line>
      <line>Grateful she was, and yet a little sore –</line>
      <line>Again it opens, it can be no other,</line>
      <line>’Tis surely Juan now – No! I’m afraid</line>
      <line>That night the Virgin was no further prayed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She now determined that a virtuous woman</line>
      <line>Should rather face and overcome temptation,</line>
      <line>That flight was base and dastardly, and no man</line>
      <line>Should ever give her heart the least sensation;</line>
      <line>That is to say, a thought beyond the common</line>
      <line>Preference that we must feel upon occasion</line>
      <line> For people who are pleasanter than others –</line>
      <line>But then they only seem so many brothers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And even if by chance (and who can tell –</line>
      <line>The devil’s so very sly) she should discover</line>
      <line>That all within was not so very well,</line>
      <line>And, if still free, that such or such a lover</line>
      <line>Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell</line>
      <line>Such thoughts, and be the better when they’re over.</line>
      <line>And if the man should ask, ’tis but denial:</line>
      <line>I recommend young ladies to make trial.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And then there are such things as love divine,</line>
      <line>Bright and immaculate, unmixed and pure,</line>
      <line>Such as the angels think so very fine,</line>
      <line>And matrons, who would be no less secure,</line>
      <line>Platonic, perfect, ‘just such love as mine’:</line>
      <line>Thus Julia said – and thought so, to be sure –</line>
      <line>And so I’d have her think, were I the man</line>
      <line>On whom her reveries celestial ran.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such love is innocent, and may exist</line>
      <line>Between young persons without any danger –</line>
      <line> A hand may first, and then a lip be kissed –</line>
      <line>For my part, to such doings I’m a stranger,</line>
      <line>But hear these freedoms form the utmost list</line>
      <line>Of all o’er which such love may be a ranger:</line>
      <line>If people go beyond, ’tis quite a crime,</line>
      <line>But not my fault – I tell them all in time.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love, then, but love within its proper limits,</line>
      <line>Was Julia’s innocent determination</line>
      <line>In young Don Juan’s favour. And to him, its</line>
      <line>Exertion might be useful on occasion,</line>
      <line> And (lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its</line>
      <line>Etherial lustre) with what sweet persuasion</line>
      <line>He might be taught, by love and her together –</line>
      <line>I really don’t know what, nor Julia either!</line>

      <line>Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced</line>
      <line>In mail of proof (her purity of soul),</line>
      <line>She, for the future, of her strength convinced,</line>
      <line>And that her honour was a rock, or mole,</line>
      <line>Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed</line>
      <line>With any kind of troublesome control –</line>
      <line> But whether Julia to the task was equal</line>
      <line>Is that which must be mentioned in the sequel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her plan she deemed both innocent and feasible,</line>
      <line>And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen</line>
      <line>Not scandal’s fangs could fix on much that’s seizable,</line>
      <line>Or if they did so, satisfied to mean</line>
      <line>Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable –</line>
      <line>A quiet conscience makes one so serene!</line>
      <line>Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded</line>
      <line>That all the Apostles would have done as they did.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And if in the mean time her husband died –</line>
      <line>But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross</line>
      <line>Her brain, though in a dream – and then she sighed –</line>
      <line>Never could she survive that common loss! –</line>
      <line>But just suppose that moment should betide,</line>
      <line>I only say suppose it, inter nos</line>
      <line>(This should be entre nous, for Julia thought</line>
      <line>In French, but then the rhyme would go for nought),</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I only say suppose this supposition:</line>
      <line>Juan being then grown up to man’s estate</line>
      <line> Would fully suit a widow of condition,</line>
      <line>Even seven years hence it would not be too late;</line>
      <line>And in the interim (to pursue this vision)</line>
      <line>The mischief, after all, could not be great,</line>
      <line>For he would learn the rudiments of love –</line>
      <line>I mean the seraph way of those above.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So much for Julia. Now we’ll turn to Juan,</line>
      <line>Poor little fellow, he had no idea</line>
      <line>Of his own case, and never hit the true one;</line>
      <line>In feelings quick as Ovid’s Miss Medea,</line>
      <line> He puzzled over what he found a new one,</line>
      <line>But not as yet imagined it could be a</line>
      <line>Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,</line>
      <line>Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,</line>
      <line>His home deserted for the lonely wood,</line>
      <line>Tormented with a wound he could not know,</line>
      <line>His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:</line>
      <line>I’m fond myself of solitude or so,</line>
      <line>But then, I beg it may be understood,</line>
      <line> By solitude I mean a sultan’s, not</line>
      <line>A hermit’s, with a harem for a grot.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,</line>
      <line>Where transport and security entwine,</line>
      <line>Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,</line>
      <line>And here thou art a god indeed divine.’</line>
      <line>The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,</line>
      <line>With the exception of the second line,</line>
      <line>For that same twining ‘transport and security’</line>
      <line>Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals</line>
      <line>To the good sense and senses of mankind,</line>
      <line>The very thing which everybody feels,</line>
      <line>As all have found on trial, or may find,</line>
      <line>That no one likes to be disturbed at meals</line>
      <line>Or love! I won’t say more about ‘entwined’</line>
      <line>Or ‘transport’, as we knew all that before,</line>
      <line>But beg ‘security’ will bolt the door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Young Juan wandered by the glassy brooks</line>
      <line>Thinking unutterable things; he threw</line>
      <line> Himself at length within the leafy nooks</line>
      <line>Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;</line>
      <line>There poets find materials for their books,</line>
      <line>And every now and then we read them through,</line>
      <line>So that their plan and prosody are eligible,</line>
      <line>Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He, Juan (and not Wordsworth) so pursued</line>
      <line>His self-communion with his own high soul</line>
      <line>Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,</line>
      <line>Had mitigated part, though not the whole</line>
      <line> Of its disease; he did the best he could</line>
      <line>With things not very subject to control,</line>
      <line>And turned, without perceiving his condition,</line>
      <line>Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He thought about himself, and the whole earth,</line>
      <line>Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,</line>
      <line>And how the deuce they ever could have birth;</line>
      <line>And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,</line>
      <line>How many miles the moon might have in girth,</line>
      <line>Of air-balloons, and of the many bars</line>
      <line> To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies –</line>
      <line>And then he thought of Donna Julia’s eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern</line>
      <line>Longings sublime, and aspirations high,</line>
      <line>Which some are born with, but the most part learn</line>
      <line>To plague themselves withal, they know not why:</line>
      <line>’Twas strange that one so young should thus concern</line>
      <line>His brain about the action of the sky;</line>
      <line>If you think ’twas philosophy that this did,</line>
      <line>I can’t help thinking puberty assisted.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,</line>
      <line>And heard a voice in all the winds; and then</line>
      <line>He thought of wood nymphs and immortal bowers,</line>
      <line>And how the goddesses came down to men:</line>
      <line>He missed the pathway, he forgot the hours,</line>
      <line>And when he looked upon his watch again,</line>
      <line>He found how much old Time had been a winner –</line>
      <line>He also found that he had lost his dinner.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sometimes he turned to gaze upon his book,</line>
      <line>Boscan, or Garcilasso – by the wind</line>
      <line> Even as the page is rustled while we look,</line>
      <line>So by the poesy of his own mind</line>
      <line>Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,</line>
      <line>As if ’twere one whereon magicians bind</line>
      <line>Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,</line>
      <line>According to some good old woman’s tale.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus would he while his lonely hours away</line>
      <line>Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;</line>
      <line>Nor glowing reverie, nor poet’s lay,</line>
      <line>Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,</line>
      <line> A bosom whereon he his head might lay,</line>
      <line>And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,</line>
      <line>With – several other things, which I forget,</line>
      <line>Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,</line>
      <line>Could not escape the gentle Julia’s eyes;</line>
      <line>She saw that Juan was not at his ease;</line>
      <line>But that which chiefly may, and must, surprise</line>
      <line>Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease</line>
      <line>Her only son with question or surmise;</line>
      <line> Whether it was she did not see, or would not,</line>
      <line>Or, like all very clever people, could not.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This may seem strange, but yet ’tis very common;</line>
      <line>For instance, gentlemen, whose ladies take</line>
      <line>Leave to o’erstep the written rights of woman</line>
      <line>And break the – which commandment is’t they break</line>
      <line>(I have forgot the number, and think no man</line>
      <line>Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake) –</line>
      <line>I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,</line>
      <line>They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A real husband always is suspicious,</line>
      <line>But still no less suspects in the wrong place,</line>
      <line>Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,</line>
      <line>Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace</line>
      <line>By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious –</line>
      <line>The last indeed’s infallibly the case:</line>
      <line>And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,</line>
      <line>He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;</line>
      <line>Though watchful as the lynx, they ne’er discover,</line>
      <line> The while the wicked world beholds delighted,</line>
      <line>Young Hopeful’s mistress, or Miss Fanny’s lover,</line>
      <line>Till some confounded escapade has blighted</line>
      <line>The plan of twenty years, and all is over;</line>
      <line>And then the mother cries, the father swears,</line>
      <line>And wonders why the devil he got heirs.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Inez was so anxious, and so clear</line>
      <line>Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,</line>
      <line>She had some other motive much more near</line>
      <line>For leaving Juan to his new temptation;</line>
      <line>But what that motive was, I shan’t say here;</line>
      <line>Perhaps to finish Juan’s education,</line>
      <line>Perhaps to open Don Alfonso’s eyes,</line>
      <line>In case he thought his wife too great a prize.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was upon a day, a summer’s day –</line>
      <line>Summer’s indeed a very dangerous season,</line>
      <line>And so is spring about the end of May –</line>
      <line>The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;</line>
      <line>But whatsoe’er the cause is, one may say,</line>
      <line>And stand convicted of more truth than treason,</line>
      <line> That there are months which nature grows more merry in:</line>
      <line>March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas on a summer’s day – the sixth of June –</line>
      <line>I like to be particular in dates,</line>
      <line>Not only of the age, and year, but moon;</line>
      <line>They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates</line>
      <line>Change horses, making history change its tune,</line>
      <line>Then spur away o’er empires and o’er states,</line>
      <line>Leaving at last not much besides chronology,</line>
      <line>Excepting the post-obits of theology.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> ’Twas on the sixth of June, about the hour</line>
      <line>Of half-past six – perhaps still nearer seven –</line>
      <line>When Julia sat within as pretty a bower</line>
      <line>As e’er held houri in that heathenish heaven</line>
      <line>Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,</line>
      <line>To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,</line>
      <line>With all the trophies of triumphant song –</line>
      <line>He won them well, and may he wear them long!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She sat, but not alone; I know not well</line>
      <line>How this same interview had taken place,</line>
      <line> And even if I knew, I should not tell –</line>
      <line>People should hold their tongues in any case –</line>
      <line>No matter how or why the thing befell,</line>
      <line>But there were she and Juan, face to face.</line>
      <line>When two such faces are so, ’twould be wise,</line>
      <line>But very difficult, to shut their eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How beautiful she looked! Her conscious heart</line>
      <line>Glowed in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.</line>
      <line>Oh Love, how perfect is thy mystic art,</line>
      <line>Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,</line>
      <line> How self-deceitful is the sagest part</line>
      <line>Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along –</line>
      <line>The precipice she stood on was immense,</line>
      <line>So was her creed in her own innocence.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She thought of her own strength, and Juan’s youth,</line>
      <line>And of the folly of all prudish fears,</line>
      <line>Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,</line>
      <line>And then of Don Alfonso’s fifty years:</line>
      <line>I wish these last had not occurred, in sooth,</line>
      <line>Because that number rarely much endears,</line>
      <line> And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,</line>
      <line>Sounds ill in love, whate’er it may in money.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When people say, ‘I’ve told you fifty times’,</line>
      <line>They mean to scold, and very often do;</line>
      <line>When poets say, ‘I’ve written fifty rhymes’,</line>
      <line>They make you dread that they’ll recite them too;</line>
      <line>In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;</line>
      <line>At fifty love for love is rare, ’tis true,</line>
      <line>But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,</line>
      <line>A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love</line>
      <line>For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,</line>
      <line>By all the vows below to powers above,</line>
      <line>She never would disgrace the ring she wore,</line>
      <line>Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;</line>
      <line>And while she pondered this, besides much more,</line>
      <line>One hand on Juan’s carelessly was thrown,</line>
      <line>Quite by mistake – she thought it was her own;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Unconsciously she leaned upon the other,</line>
      <line>Which played within the tangles of her hair;</line>
      <line> And to contend with thoughts she could not smother,</line>
      <line>She seemed by the distraction of her air.</line>
      <line>’Twas surely very wrong in Juan’s mother</line>
      <line>To leave together this imprudent pair –</line>
      <line>She who for many years had watched her son so:</line>
      <line>I’m very certain mine would not have done so.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The hand which still held Juan’s, by degrees</line>
      <line>Gently, but palpably confirmed its grasp,</line>
      <line>As if it said ‘Detain me, if you please’;</line>
      <line>Yet there’s no doubt she only meant to clasp</line>
      <line> His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze;</line>
      <line>She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,</line>
      <line>Had she imagined such a thing could rouse</line>
      <line>A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I cannot know what Juan thought of this,</line>
      <line>But what he did, is much what you would do;</line>
      <line>His young lip thanked it with a grateful kiss,</line>
      <line>And then, abashed at its own joy, withdrew</line>
      <line>In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,</line>
      <line>Love is so very timid when ’tis new:</line>
      <line> She blushed, and frowned not, but she strove to speak,</line>
      <line>And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon –</line>
      <line>The devil’s in the moon for mischief – they</line>
      <line>Who called her chaste, methinks, began too soon</line>
      <line>Their nomenclature; there is not a day,</line>
      <line>The longest, not the twenty-first of June,</line>
      <line>Sees half the business in a wicked way</line>
      <line>On which three single hours of moonshine smile.</line>
      <line>And then she looks so modest all the while!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There is a dangerous silence in that hour,</line>
      <line>A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul</line>
      <line>To open all itself, without the power</line>
      <line>Of calling wholly back its self-control;</line>
      <line>The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,</line>
      <line>Sheds beauty and deep softness o’er the whole,</line>
      <line>Breathes also to the heart, and o’er it throws</line>
      <line>A loving languor, which is not repose.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Julia sat with Juan, half embraced</line>
      <line>And half retiring from the glowing arm,</line>
      <line> Which trembled like the bosom where ’twas placed;</line>
      <line>Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,</line>
      <line>Or else ’twere easy to withdraw her waist;</line>
      <line>But then the situation had its charm,</line>
      <line>And then – God knows what next – I can’t go on;</line>
      <line>I’m almost sorry that I e’er begun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Plato! Plato! You have paved the way,</line>
      <line>With your confounded fantasies, to more</line>
      <line>Immoral conduct by the fancied sway</line>
      <line>Your system feigns o’er the controlless core</line>
      <line> Of human hearts, than all the long array</line>
      <line>Of poets and romancers. You’re a bore,</line>
      <line>A charlatan, a coxcomb – and have been,</line>
      <line>At best, no better than a go-between!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Julia’s voice was lost, except in sighs,</line>
      <line>Until too late for useful conversation;</line>
      <line>The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,</line>
      <line>I wish, indeed, they had not had occasion,</line>
      <line>But who, alas, can love, and then be wise?</line>
      <line>Not that remorse did not oppose temptation,</line>
      <line> A little still she strove, and much repented,</line>
      <line>And whispering ‘I will ne’er consent’ – consented…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Man’s a phenomenon, one knows not what,</line>

      <line>’Tis pity though, in this sublime world, that</line>
      <line>Pleasure’s a sin, and sometimes sin’s a pleasure!</line>
      <line>Few mortals know what end they would be at,</line>
      <line>But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,</line>
      <line>The path is through perplexing ways, and when</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What then? I do not know. No more do you –</line>
      <line>And so good night! Return we to our story:</line>
      <line>’Twas in November, when fine days are few,</line>
      <line>And the far mountains wax a little hoary</line>
      <line>And clap a white cape on their mantles blue,</line>
      <line>And the sea dashes round the promontory,</line>
      <line>And the wild breaker boils against the rock,</line>
      <line>And sober suns must set at five O’clock.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;</line>
      <line>No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud</line>
      <line>By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright</line>
      <line>With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;</line>
      <line>There’s something cheerful in that sort of light,</line>
      <line>Even as a summer sky’s without a cloud:</line>
      <line>I’m fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,</line>
      <line>A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas midnight, Donna Julia was in bed</line>
      <line>(Sleeping, most probably), when at her door</line>
      <line>Arose a clatter might awake the dead,</line>
      <line>If they had never been awoke before –</line>
      <line>And that they have been so we all have read,</line>
      <line>And are to be so, at the least, once more!</line>
      <line>The door was fastened, but with voice and fist</line>
      <line>First knocks were heard, then ‘Madam – Madam – hist!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For God’s sake, Madam – Madam – here’s my master,</line>
      <line>With more than half the city at his back –</line>
      <line>Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!</line>
      <line>’Tis not my fault – I kept good watch. Alack!</line>
      <line>Do, pray undo the bolt a little faster –</line>
      <line>They’re on the stair just now, and in a crack</line>
      <line>Will all be here! Perhaps he yet may fly –</line>
      <line>Surely the window’s not so very high?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,</line>
      <line>With torches, friends, and servants in great number;</line>
      <line>The major part of them had long been wived,</line>
      <line>And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber</line>
      <line>Of any wicked woman, who contrived</line>
      <line>By stealth her husband’s temples to encumber:</line>
      <line>Examples of this kind are so contagious,</line>
      <line>Were one not punished, all would be outrageous!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I can’t tell how, or why, or what suspicion</line>
      <line>Could enter into Don Alfonso’s head;</line>
      <line>But for a cavalier of his condition</line>
      <line>It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,</line>
      <line>Without a word of previous admonition,</line>
      <line>To hold a levée round his lady’s bed,</line>
      <line>And summon lackeys, armed with fire and sword,</line>
      <line>To prove himself the thing he most abhorred.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Poor Donna Julia! starting as from sleep,</line>
      <line>(Mind, that I do not say, she had not slept)</line>
      <line> Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;</line>
      <line>Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,</line>
      <line>Contrived to fling the bedclothes in a heap,</line>
      <line>As if she had just now from out them crept:</line>
      <line>I can’t tell why she should take all this trouble</line>
      <line>To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,</line>
      <line>Appeared like two poor harmless women, who,</line>
      <line>Of goblins, but still more of men, afraid,</line>
      <line>Had thought one man might be deterred by two,</line>
      <line> And therefore side by side were gently laid</line>
      <line>Until the hours of absence should run through</line>
      <line>And truant husband should return, and say</line>
      <line>‘My dear, I was the first who came away.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried</line>
      <line>‘In heaven’s name, Don Alfonso, what d’ye mean?</line>
      <line>Has madness seized you? Would that I had died</line>
      <line>Ere such a monster’s victim I had been!</line>
      <line>What may this midnight violence betide,</line>
      <line>A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?</line>
      <line> Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?</line>
      <line>Search, then, the room!’ Alfonso said, ‘I will.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He searched, they searched, and rummaged everywhere,</line>
      <line>Closet and clothes-press, chest and window-seat,</line>
      <line>And found much linen, lace, and several pair</line>
      <line>Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,</line>
      <line>With other articles of ladies fair,</line>
      <line>To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:</line>
      <line>Arras they pricked, and curtains, with their swords,</line>
      <line>And wounded several shutters, and some boards.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Under the bed they searched, and there they found –</line>
      <line>No matter what – it was not that they sought!</line>
      <line>They opened windows, gazing if the ground</line>
      <line>Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;</line>
      <line>And then they stared each others’ faces round:</line>
      <line>’Tis odd, not one of all these seekers thought</line>
      <line>(And seems to me almost a sort of blunder),</line>
      <line>Of looking in the bed as well as under.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>During this inquisition Julia’s tongue</line>
      <line>Was not asleep: ‘Yes, search and search’, she cried,</line>
      <line> ‘Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!</line>
      <line>It was for this that I became a bride!</line>
      <line>For this in silence I have suffered long</line>
      <line>A husband like Alfonso at my side;</line>
      <line>But now I’ll bear no more, nor here remain,</line>

      <line>‘Yes, Don Alfonso! – husband now no more</line>
      <line>(If ever you indeed deserved the name),</line>

      <line>Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same!</line>
      <line> Is’t wise or fitting causeless to explore</line>
      <line>For facts against a virtuous woman’s fame?</line>
      <line>Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>

      <line>Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?</line>
      <line>Is it for this, whate’er my suitors were,</line>
      <line>I favoured none-nay, was almost uncivil?</line>
      <line>Is it for this that General Count O’Reilly,</line>
      <line>Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani</line>

      <line>Now, tell me, don’t you cut a pretty figure?</line>

    <stanza>

      <line>With that sublime of rascals your attorney,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Perhaps ’tis of Antonia you are jealous,</line>

      <line>Look where you please – we’ve nothing, sir, to hide –</line>
      <line> Only another time, I trust, you’ll tell us,</line>

      <line>A moment at the door, that we may be</line>

      <line>The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow –</line>

      <line>Antonia! where’s my pocket-handkerchief?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She ceased, and turned upon her pillow. Pale</line>
      <line>She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,</line>
      <line>Like skies that rain and lighten – as a veil,</line>
      <line>Waved and o’ershading her wan cheek, appears</line>
      <line>Her streaming hair. The black curls strive, but fail,</line>
      <line>To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears</line>
      <line>Its snow through all – her soft lips lie apart,</line>
      <line>And louder than her breathing beats her heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The Señor Don Alfonso stood confused;</line>
      <line>Antonia bustled round the ransacked room,</line>
      <line>And, turning up her nose, with looks abused</line>
      <line>Her master, and his myrmidons, of whom</line>
      <line>Not one, except the attorney, was amused –</line>
      <line>He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,</line>
      <line>So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,</line>
      <line>Knowing they must be settled by the laws.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,</line>
      <line>Following Antonia’s motions here and there,</line>
      <line> With much suspicion in his attitude.</line>
      <line>For reputations he had little care –</line>
      <line>So that a suit or action were made good –</line>
      <line>Small pity had he for the young and fair,</line>
      <line>And ne’er believed in negatives, till these</line>
      <line>Were proved by competent false witnesses.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,</line>
      <line>And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;</line>
      <line>When, after searching in five hundred nooks,</line>
      <line>And treating a young wife with so much rigour,</line>
      <line> He gained no point, except some self-rebukes,</line>
      <line>Added to those his lady with such vigour</line>
      <line>Had poured upon him for the last half-hour,</line>
      <line>Quick, thick, and heavy – as a thunder-shower.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At first he tried to hammer an excuse,</line>
      <line>To which the sole reply were tears, and sobs,</line>
      <line>And indications of hysterics, whose</line>
      <line>Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,</line>
      <line>Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose –</line>
      <line>Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job’s!</line>
      <line> He saw too, in perspective, her relations,</line>
      <line>And then he tried to muster all his patience.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,</line>
      <line>But sage Antonia cut him short before</line>
      <line>The anvil of his speech received the hammer,</line>
      <line>With ‘Pray sir, leave the room, and say no more,</line>
      <line>Or madam dies!’ Alfonso muttered ‘Damn her’,</line>
      <line>But nothing else, the time of words was o’er –</line>
      <line>He cast a rueful look or two, and did</line>
      <line>(He knew not wherefore) that which he was bid.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With him retired his posse comitatus,</line>
      <line>The attorney last, who lingered near the door</line>
      <line>Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as</line>
      <line>Antonia let him – not a little sore</line>
      <line>At this most strange and unexplained ‘hiatus’</line>
      <line>In Don Alfonso’s facts, which just now wore</line>
      <line>An awkward look. As he revolved the case</line>
      <line>The door was fastened in his legal face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No sooner was it bolted, than – oh shame!</line>
      <line>Oh sin! oh sorrow! and oh womankind!</line>
      <line> How can you do such things and keep your fame,</line>
      <line>Unless this world, and t’other too, be blind?</line>
      <line>Nothing so dear as an unfilched good name!</line>
      <line>But to proceed (for there is more behind) –</line>
      <line>With much heart-felt reluctance be it said,</line>
      <line>Young Juan slipped, half-smothered, from the bed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had been hid – I don’t pretend to say</line>
      <line>How, nor can I indeed describe the where</line>
      <line>(Young, slender, and packed easily, he lay,</line>
      <line>No doubt, in little compass, round or square) –</line>
      <line> But pity him I neither must nor may</line>
      <line>His suffocation by that pretty pair:</line>
      <line>’Twere better, sure, to die so, than be shut</line>
      <line>With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, secondly, I pity not, because</line>
      <line>He had no business to commit a sin,</line>
      <line>Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws –</line>
      <line>At least ’twas rather early to begin!</line>
      <line>But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws</line>
      <line>So much as when we call our old debts in</line>
      <line> At sixty years, and draw the accounts of evil,</line>
      <line>And find a deucéd balance with the Devil!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Of his position I can give no notion –</line>
      <line>’Tis written in the Hebrew Chronicle,</line>
      <line>How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,</line>
      <line>Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,</line>
      <line>When old King David’s blood grew dull in motion,</line>
      <line>And that the medicine answered very well.</line>
      <line>Perhaps ’twas in a different way applied,</line>
      <line>For David lived, but Juan nearly died!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> What’s to be done? Alfonso will be back</line>
      <line>The moment he has sent his fools away.</line>
      <line>Antonia’s skill was put upon the rack,</line>
      <line>But no device could be brought into play –</line>
      <line>And how to parry the renewed attack?</line>
      <line>Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:</line>
      <line>Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,</line>
      <line>But pressed her bloodless lip to Juan’s cheek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He turned his lip to hers, and with his hand</line>
      <line>Called back the tangles of her wandering hair;</line>
      <line> Even then their love they could not all command,</line>
      <line>And half forgot their danger and despair:</line>
      <line>Antonia’s patience now was at a stand –</line>
      <line>‘Come, come, ’tis no time now for fooling there!’</line>
      <line>She whispered, in great wrath – ‘I must deposit</line>
      <line>This pretty gentleman within the closet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night!</line>
      <line>Who can have put my master in this mood?</line>
      <line>What will become on’t? I’m in such a fright –</line>
      <line>The devil’s in the urchin, and no good!</line>
      <line> Is this a time for giggling – this a plight?</line>
      <line>Why, don’t you know that it may end in blood?</line>
      <line>You’ll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,</line>
      <line>My mistress, all – for that half-girlish face!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Had it but been for a stout cavalier</line>
      <line>Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste),</line>
      <line>But for a child, what piece of work is here!</line>
      <line>I really, madam, wonder at your taste</line>
      <line>(Come, sir, get in) – my Master must be near!</line>
      <line>There, for the present, at the least he’s fast,</line>
      <line> And, if we can but till the morning keep</line>
      <line>Our counsel – Juan, mind, you must not sleep!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,</line>
      <line>Closed the oration of the trusty maid:</line>
      <line>She loitered, and he told her to be gone,</line>
      <line>An order somewhat sullenly obeyed;</line>
      <line>However, present remedy was none,</line>
      <line>And no great good seemed answered if she stayed:</line>
      <line>Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,</line>
      <line>She snuffed the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Alfonso paused a minute, then begun</line>
      <line>Some strange excuses for his late proceeding –</line>
      <line>He would not justify what he had done,</line>
      <line>To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;</line>
      <line>But there were ample reasons for it (none</line>
      <line>Of which he specified in this his pleading) –</line>
      <line>His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,</line>
      <line>Of rhetoric, which the learn’d call rigmarole.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Julia said nought; though all the while there rose</line>
      <line>A ready answer, which at once enables</line>
      <line> A matron who her husband’s foible knows,</line>
      <line>By a few timely words to turn the tables,</line>
      <line>Which if it does not silence still must pose –</line>
      <line>Even if it should comprise a pack of fables:</line>
      <line>’Tis to retort with firmness, and when he</line>
      <line>OO Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds</line>
      <line>(Alfonso’s loves with Inez were well known);</line>
      <line>But whether ’twas that one’s own guilt confounds –</line>
      <line>But that can’t be, as has been often shown</line>
      <line>A lady with apologies abounds –</line>
      <line>It might be that her silence sprang alone</line>
      <line>From delicacy to Don Juan’s ear,</line>
      <line>To whom she knew his mother’s fame was dear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There might be one more motive (which makes two):</line>
      <line>Alfonso ne’er to Juan had alluded –</line>
      <line>Mentioned his jealousy, but never who</line>
      <line>Had been the happy lover he concluded</line>
      <line>Concealed amongst his premises (’tis true,</line>
      <line>His mind the more o’er this its mystery brooded) –</line>
      <line> To speak of Inez now were, one may say,</line>
      <line>Like throwing Juan in Alfonso’s way!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A hint, in tender cases, is enough;</line>
      <line>Silence is best, besides there is a tact</line>
      <line>(That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,</line>
      <line>But it will serve to keep my verse compact)</line>
      <line>Which keeps, when pushed by questions rather rough,</line>
      <line>A lady always distant from the fact –</line>
      <line>The charming creatures lie with such a grace,</line>
      <line>There’s nothing so becoming to the face.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> They blush, and we believe them; at least I</line>
      <line>Have always done so! ’Tis of no great use,</line>
      <line>In any case, attempting a reply,</line>
      <line>For then their eloquence grows quite profuse –</line>
      <line>And when at length they’re out of breath, they sigh,</line>
      <line>And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose</line>
      <line>A tear or two, and then we make it up:</line>
      <line>And then – and then – and then – sit down and sup.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alfonso closed his speech, and begged her pardon,</line>
      <line>Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,</line>
      <line> And laid conditions, he thought very hard, on –</line>
      <line>Denying several little things he wanted!</line>
      <line>He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,</line>
      <line>With useless penitence perplexed and haunted,</line>
      <line>Beseeching she no further would refuse –</line>
      <line>When lo! he stumbled o’er a pair of shoes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A pair of shoes – what then? Not much, if they</line>
      <line>Are such as fit with lady’s feet – but these</line>
      <line>(No one can tell how much I grieve to say)</line>
      <line>Were masculine! To see them, and to seize,</line>
      <line> Was but a moment’s act! Ah, well-a-day –</line>
      <line>My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze –</line>
      <line>Alfonso first examined well their fashion,</line>
      <line>And then flew out into another passion.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He left the room for his relinquished sword,</line>
      <line>And Julia instant to the closet flew.</line>
      <line>‘Fly, Juan, fly! for Heaven’s sake! Not a word –</line>
      <line>The door is open – you may yet slip through</line>
      <line>The passage you so often have explored –</line>
      <line>Here is the garden-key! Fly – fly – Adieu!</line>
      <line> Haste – haste! – I hear Alfonso’s hurrying feet!</line>
      <line>Day has not broke – there’s no one in the street.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>None can say that this was not good advice,</line>
      <line>The only mischief was, it came too late</line>
      <line>(Of all experience ’tis the usual price,</line>
      <line>A sort of income-tax laid on by fate) –</line>
      <line>Juan had reached the room-door in a trice,</line>
      <line>And might have done so by the garden-gate,</line>
      <line>But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,</line>
      <line>Who threatened death – so Juan knocked him down.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light,</line>
      <line>Antonia cried out ‘Rape!’ and Julia ‘Fire!’</line>
      <line>But not a servant stirred to aid the fight.</line>
      <line>Alfonso, pummelled to his heart’s desire,</line>
      <line>Swore lustily he’d be revenged this night –</line>
      <line>And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher!</line>
      <line>His blood was up – though young, he was a tartar,</line>
      <line>And not at all disposed to prove a martyr!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alfonso’s sword had dropped ere he could draw it,</line>
      <line>And they continued battling hand to hand,</line>
      <line> For Juan very luckily ne’er saw it!</line>
      <line>His temper not being under great command,</line>
      <line>If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,</line>
      <line>Alfonso’s days had not been in the land</line>
      <line>Much longer. Think of husbands’, lovers’, lives!</line>
      <line>And how ye may be doubly widows–wives!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,</line>
      <line>And Juan throttled him to get away,</line>
      <line>And blood (’twas from the nose) began to flow;</line>
      <line>At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,</line>
      <line> Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,</line>
      <line>And then his only garment quite gave way –</line>
      <line>He fled, like Joseph, leaving it! but there,</line>
      <line>I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found</line>
      <line>An awkward spectacle their eyes before:</line>
      <line>Antonia in hysterics, Julia swooned,</line>
      <line>Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;</line>
      <line>Some half-torn drapery scattered on the ground,</line>
      <line>Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more –</line>
      <line> Juan the gate gained, turned the key about,</line>
      <line>And liking not the inside, locked the out!</line>

      <line> As many a time</line>
      <line>They had seen it before.</line>
      <line>So I told them in rhyme,</line>
      <line>For of rhymes I had store;</line>

      <line>For their recreation</line>

    <title>The Legend of Manor Hall</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Old Farmer Wall, of Manor Hall,</line>
      <line>To market drove his wain:</line>
      <line>Along the road it went, well stowed</line>
      <line>With sacks of golden grain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> His station he took, but in vain did he look</line>
      <line>For a customer all the morn,</line>
      <line>Though the farmers all, save Farmer Wall,</line>
      <line>They sold off all their corn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then home he went, sore discontent,</line>
      <line>And many an oath he swore,</line>
      <line>And he kicked up rows with his children and spouse</line>
      <line>When they met him at the door!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Next market-day he drove away</line>
      <line>To the town his loaded wain:</line>
      <line> The farmers all, save Farmer Wall,</line>
      <line>They sold off all their grain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No bidder he found, and he stood astound</line>
      <line>At the close of the market-day,</line>
      <line>When the market was done, and the chapmen were gone</line>
      <line>Each man his several way.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He stalked by his load along the road,</line>
      <line>His face with wrath was red;</line>
      <line>His arms he tossed, like a good man crossed</line>
      <line>In seeking his daily bread.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> His face was red, and fierce was his tread,</line>
      <line>And with lusty voice cried he,</line>
      <line>‘My corn I’ll sell to the Devil of Hell,</line>
      <line>If he’ll my chapman be!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>These words he spoke just under an oak</line>
      <line>Seven hundred winters old;</line>
      <line>And he straight was aware of a man sitting there</line>
      <line>On the roots and grassy mould.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The roots rose high, o’er the greensward dry,</line>
      <line>And the grass around was green</line>
      <line> Save just the space of the stranger’s place,</line>
      <line>Where it seemed as a fire had been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All scorched was the spot, as gypsy-pot</line>
      <line>Had swung and bubbled there:</line>
      <line>The grass was marred, the roots were charred,</line>
      <line>And the ivy-stems were bare.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The stranger sprung up: to the farmer he flung</line>
      <line>A loud and friendly hail,</line>
      <line>And he said, ‘I see well thou hast corn to sell –</line>
      <line>And I’ll buy it on the nail!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The twain in a trice agreed on the price;</line>
      <line>The stranger his earnest paid,</line>
      <line>And with horses and wain to come for the grain</line>
      <line>His own appointment made.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The farmer cracked his whip and tracked</line>
      <line>His way right merrily on;</line>
      <line>He struck up a song as he trudged along</line>
      <line>For joy that his job was done.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His children fair he danced in the air –</line>
      <line>His heart with joy was big –</line>
      <line> He kissed his wife, he seized a knife,</line>
      <line>He slew a sucking-pig!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The faggots burned, the porkling turned</line>
      <line>And crackled before the fire,</line>
      <line>And an odour arose that was sweet in the nose</line>
      <line>Of a passing ghostly friar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He tirled the pin, he entered in,</line>
      <line>He sat down at the board;</line>
      <line>The pig he blest, when he saw it well dressed,</line>
      <line>And the humming ale outpoured.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The friar laughed, the friar quaffed,</line>
      <line>He chirped like a bird in May;</line>
      <line>The farmer told how his corn he had sold</line>
      <line>As he journeyed home that day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The friar he quaffed, but no longer he laughed,</line>
      <line>He changed from red to pale;</line>
      <line>‘Oh hapless elf, ’tis the Fiend himself</line>
      <line>To whom thou hast made thy sale!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The friar he quaffed, he took a deep draught,</line>
      <line>He crossed himself amain:</line>
      <line> ‘Oh slave of pelf, ’tis the Devil himself</line>
      <line>To whom thou has sold thy grain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And sure as the day, he’ll fetch thee away</line>
      <line>With the corn which thou hast sold,</line>
      <line>If thou let him pay o’er one tester more</line>
      <line>Than thy settled price in gold.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The farmer gave vent to a loud lament,</line>
      <line>The wife to a long outcry;</line>
      <line>Their relish for pig and ale had flown,</line>
      <line>The friar alone picked every bone</line>
      <line> And drained the flagon dry!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The friar was gone, the morning dawn</line>
      <line>Appeared, and the stranger’s wain</line>
      <line>Came to the hour, with six-horse power,</line>
      <line>To fetch the purchased grain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The horses were black – on their dewy track</line>
      <line>Light steam from the ground upcurled;</line>
      <line>Long wreaths of smoke from their nostrils broke,</line>
      <line>And their tails like torches whirled!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>More dark and grim, in face and limb,</line>
      <line> Seemed the stranger than before,</line>
      <line>As his empty wain, with steeds thrice twain,</line>
      <line>Drew up at the farmer’s door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the stranger’s face was a sly grimace</line>
      <line>As he seized the sacks of grain</line>
      <line>And, one by one, till left were none,</line>
      <line>He tossed them on the wain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And slyly he leered as his hand upreared</line>
      <line>A purse of costly mould,</line>
      <line>Where bright and fresh through a silver mesh</line>
      <line>Shone forth the glittering gold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The farmer held out his right hand stout,</line>
      <line>And drew it back with dread;</line>
      <line>For in fancy he heard each warning word</line>
      <line>The supping friar had said.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His eye was set on the silver net,</line>
      <line>His thoughts were in fearful strife</line>
      <line>When, sudden as fate, the glittering bait</line>
      <line>Was snatched by his loving wife!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, swift as thought, the stranger caught</line>
      <line> The farmer his waist around,</line>
      <line>And at once the twain and the loaded wain</line>
      <line>Sank through the rifted ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The gable-end wall of Manor Hall</line>
      <line>Fell in ruins on the place –</line>
      <line>That stone-heap old the tale has told</line>
      <line>To each succeeding race.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wife gave a cry that rent the sky</line>
      <line>At her goodman’s downward flight;</line>
      <line>But she held the purse fast, and a glance she cast</line>
      <line> To see that all was right!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas the Fiend’s full-pay for her goodman gray,</line>
      <line>And the gold was good and true;</line>
      <line>Which made her declare that ‘his dealings were fair,</line>
      <line>To give the Devil his due!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She wore the black pall for Farmer Wall,</line>
      <line>From her fond embraces riven –</line>
      <line>But she won the vows of a younger spouse</line>
      <line>With the gold which the Fiend had given!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, farmers, beware of the oaths you swear</line>
      <line> When you cannot sell your corn,</line>
      <line>Lest to bid and buy a stranger be nigh,</line>
      <line>With hidden tail and horn!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And with good heed the moral a-read</line>
      <line>Which is of this tale the pith:</line>
      <line>If your corn you sell to the Fiend of Hell</line>
      <line>You may sell yourself therewith.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if by mishap you fall in the trap,</line>
      <line>Would you bring the fiend to shame,</line>
      <line>Lest the tempting prize should dazzle her eyes,</line>
      <line> Lock up your frugal dame!</line>

      <line>Yes, I know that you once were my lover,</line>
      <line>But that sort of thing has an end,</line>
      <line>And though love and its transports are over,</line>
      <line>You know you can still be – my friend:</line>
      <line> I was young, too, and foolish, remember</line>
      <line>(Did you ever hear John Hardy sing?) –</line>
      <line>It was then the fifteenth of November,</line>
      <line>And this is the end of the spring!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You complain that you are not well-treated</line>
      <line>By my suddenly altering so;</line>
      <line>Can I help it? – you’re very conceited,</line>
      <line>If you think yourself equal to Joe.</line>
      <line>Don’t kneel at my feet, I implore you;</line>
      <line>Don’t write on the drawings you bring;</line>
      <line> Don’t ask me to say, ‘I adore you,’</line>
      <line>For, indeed, it is now no such thing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I confess, when at Bognor we parted,</line>

      <line>And you the most charming of men.</line>
      <line>I confess, when I read your first letter,</line>
      <line>I blotted your name with a tear –</line>

      <line>For I love Hardy better than you!</line>
      <line>Yes! my fond heart has fixed on another</line>
      <line>(I sigh so whenever he’s gone),</line>

      <line>’Tis a curious assortment of dainty regales</line>

      <line>Fine chains for the neck, and a cat with nine tails,</line>
      <line>Which nobody can deny, deny,</line>

      <line>Here’s supple-jack plenty, and store of rattan</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here’s padlocks and bolts and screws for the thumbs</line>
      <line>That squeeze them so lovingly till the blood comes,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Thus, going to market, we kindly prepare</line>
      <line>A pretty black cargo of African ware</line>

      <line>But ah, if in vain I have studied an art</line>
      <line>So gainful to me (all boasting apart),</line>

    <title>Death of Luco (from On the Inhumanity of the Slave Trade)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun had reached</line>
      <line>His zenith. Pausing faintly, Luco stood</line>
      <line> Leaning upon his hoe, while memory brought,</line>
      <line>In piteous imagery, his agéd father,</line>
      <line>His poor fond mother, and his faithful maid.</line>
      <line>The mental group in wildest motion set</line>
      <line>Fruitless imagination – fury, grief,</line>
      <line>Alternate shame, the sense of insult, all</line>
      <line>Conspire to aid the inward storm! Yet words</line>
      <line>Were no relief: he stood in silent woe.</line>
      <line>Gorgon, remorseless Christian, saw the slave</line>
      <line>Stand musing mid the ranks and, stealing soft</line>
      <line> Behind the studious Luco, struck his cheek</line>
      <line>With a too-heavy whip that reached his eye,</line>
      <line>Making it dark for ever. Luco turned</line>
      <line>In strongest agony, and with his hoe</line>
      <line>Struck the rude Christian on the forehead. Pride,</line>
      <line>With hateful malice, seized on Gorgon’s soul</line>
      <line>(By nature fierce), while Luco sought the beach</line>
      <line>And plunged beneath the wave. But near him lay</line>
      <line>A planter’s barge, whose seamen grasped his hair,</line>
      <line>Dragging to life a wretch who wished to die.</line>
      <line> Rumour now spreads the tale, while Gorgon’s breath</line>
      <line>Envenomed aids her blast. Imputed crimes</line>
      <line>Oppose the plea of Luco, till he scorns</line>
      <line>Even a just defence, and stands prepared.</line>
      <line>The planters, conscious that to fear alone</line>
      <line>They owe their cruel power, resolve to blend</line>
      <line>New torment with the pangs of death, and hold</line>
      <line>Their victim high in dreadful view to fright</line>
      <line>The wretched number left. Luco is chained</line>
      <line>To a huge tree, his fellow-slaves are ranged</line>
      <line> To share the horrid sight; fuel is placed</line>
      <line>In an increasing train, some paces back,</line>
      <line>To kindle slowly, and approach the youth,</line>
      <line>With more than native terror.</line>
      <line>See, it burns!</line>
      <line>He gazes on the growing flame, and calls</line>
      <line>For ‘Water, water!’ The small boon’s denied.</line>
      <line>E’en Christians throng each other to behold</line>
      <line>The different alterations of his face</line>
      <line>As the hot death approaches. (Oh shame, shame</line>
      <line>Upon the followers of Jesus! Shame</line>
      <line> On him that dares avow a God!) He writhes,</line>
      <line>While down his breast glide the unpitied tears,</line>
      <line>And in their sockets strain their scorchéd balls.</line>
      <line>‘Burn, burn me quick! I cannot die!’ he cries,</line>
      <line>‘Bring fire more close!’ The planters heed him not,</line>
      <line>But still prolonging Luco’s torture, threat</line>
      <line>Their trembling slaves around...</line>
      <line>Gracious God!</line>
      <line>Why thus in mercy let thy whirlwinds sleep</line>
      <line>O’er a vile race of Christians, who profane</line>
      <line>Thy glorious attributes? Sweep them from Earth,</line>
      <line>Or check their cruel power! The savage tribes</line>
      <line>Are angels when compared to brutes like these.</line>

      <line> In vain refuse to mark thy spreading light,</line>

      <line> Nor may obtrusive Reason boldly scan,</line>
      <line>Far less reform, the rude misshapen plan:</line>
      <line>The winding labyrinths, the hostile towers</line>
      <line>(Whence danger threatens, and where horror lowers),</line>
      <line>The jealous drawbridge, and the moat profound,</line>
      <line>The lonely dungeon in the caverned ground,</line>
      <line>The sullen dome above those central caves</line>
      <line>Where lives one despot, and a host of slaves?</line>
      <line>Ah, Freedom, on this renovated shore</line>
      <line>That fabric frights the moral world no more!</line>
      <line> Shook to its basis by thy powerful spell,</line>
      <line>Its triple walls in massy fragments fell;</line>
      <line>While, rising from the hideous wreck, appears</line>
      <line>The temple thy firm arm sublimely rears –</line>
      <line>Of fair proportions, and of simple grace,</line>
      <line>A mansion worthy of the human race.</line>
      <line>For me, the witness of those scenes, whose birth</line>
      <line>Forms a new era in the storied earth,</line>
      <line>Oft, while with glowing breast those scenes I view,</line>
      <line>They lead, ah friend beloved, my thoughts to you!</line>
      <line> Ah, still each fine emotion they impart</line>
      <line>With your idea mingles in my heart –</line>
      <line>You, whose warm bosom, whose expanded mind,</line>
      <line>Have shared this glorious triumph of mankind –</line>
      <line>You, whom I oft have heard, with generous zeal,</line>
      <line>With all that truth can urge or pity feel,</line>
      <line>Refute the pompous argument, that tried</line>
      <line>The common cause of millions to deride...</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘Four years each day with daily bread was blest,</line>
      <line>By constant toil and constant prayer supplied.</line>
      <line>Three lovely infants lay within my breast,</line>
      <line>And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed</line>
      <line>And knew not why. My happy father died</line>
      <line>Just as the children’s meal began to fail,</line>
      <line> For War the nations to the field defied:</line>
      <line>The loom stood still unwatched, the idle gale</line>
      <line>Wooed in deserted shrouds the unregarding sail.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How changed at once: for Labour’s cheerful hum,</line>
      <line>Silence and fears and Misery’s weeping train.</line>
      <line>But soon with proud parade the noisy drum</line>
      <line>Beat round to sweep the streets of want and pain!</line>
      <line>My husband’s arms now only served to strain</line>
      <line>Me and his children, hungering in his view.</line>
      <line>He could not beg. My prayers and tears were vain!</line>
      <line>To join those miserable men he flew –</line>
      <line>We reached the western world a poor devoted crew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh dreadful price of being – to resign</line>
      <line>All that is dear in being! Better far</line>
      <line>In Want’s most lonely cave till death to pine</line>
      <line>Unseen, unheard, unwatched by any star.</line>
      <line>Better before proud Fortune’s sumptuous car</line>
      <line>Obvious our dying bodies to obtrude,</line>
      <line>Than dog-like, wading at the heels of War,</line>
      <line>Protract a curst existence with the brood</line>
      <line> That lap, their very nourishment, their brother’s blood!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The pains and plagues that on our heads came down</line>
      <line>(Disease and famine, agony and fear,</line>
      <line>In wood or wilderness, in camp or town),</line>
      <line>It would thy brain unsettle even to hear!</line>
      <line>All perished, all, in one remorseless year –</line>
      <line>Husband and children, one by one, by sword</line>
      <line>And scourge of fiery fever. Every tear</line>
      <line>Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board</line>
      <line>A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Peaceful as this immeasurable plain</line>
      <line>By these extended beams of dawn impressed,</line>
      <line>In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main.</line>
      <line> The very ocean has its hour of rest</line>
      <line>Ungranted to the human mourner’s breast.</line>
      <line>Remote from man and storms of mortal care,</line>
      <line>With wings which did the world of waves invest,</line>
      <line>The spirit of God diffused through balmy air</line>
      <line>Quiet that might have healed, if aught could heal, despair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, how unlike each smell, each sight and sound,</line>
      <line>That late the stupor of my spirit broke!</line>
      <line>Of noisome hospitals the groan profound,</line>
      <line>The mine’s dire earthquake, the bomb’s thunder-stroke,</line>
      <line> Heart-sickening Famine’s grim despairing look;</line>
      <line>The midnight flames in thundering deluge spread;</line>
      <line>The storméd town’s expiring shriek that woke</line>
      <line>Far round the grisly phantoms of the dead –</line>
      <line>And, pale with ghastly light, the victor’s human head!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some mighty gulf of separation passed,</line>
      <line>I seemed transported to another world –</line>
      <line>A dream resigned with pain when from the mast</line>
      <line>The impatient mariner the sail unfurled</line>
      <line>And, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled</line>
      <line> The silent seas. The pleasant thoughts of home</line>
      <line>With tears his weather-beaten cheek impearled:</line>
      <line>For me, farthest from earthly port to roam</line>
      <line>Was best – my only wish to shun where man might come.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And oft, robbed of my perfect mind, I thought</line>
      <line>At last my feet a resting-place had found.</line>
      <line>“Here will I weep in peace”, so Fancy wrought,</line>
      <line>“Roaming the illimitable waters round –</line>
      <line>Here gaze, of every friend but Death disowned,</line>
      <line>All day my ready tomb the ocean-flood.”</line>
      <line> To break my dream the vessel reached its bound,</line>
      <line>And homeless near a thousand homes I stood,</line>
      <line>And near a thousand tables pined and wanted food.’</line>

    <title>France: An Ode</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ye clouds, that far above me float and pause,</line>
      <line>Whose pathless march no mortal may control!</line>
      <line>Ye ocean-waves, that whereso’er ye roll,</line>
      <line>Yield homage only to eternal laws!</line>
      <line> Ye woods, that listen to the night-bird’s singing,</line>
      <line>Midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined,</line>
      <line>Save where your own imperious branches swinging</line>
      <line>Have made a solemn music of the wind,</line>
      <line>Where (like a man beloved of God)</line>
      <line>Through glooms which never woodman trod</line>
      <line>How oft, pursuing fancies holy,</line>
      <line>My moonlight way o’er flowering weeds I wound</line>
      <line>Inspired, beyond the guess of folly,</line>
      <line>By each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound!</line>
      <line> Oh ye loud waves, and oh ye forests high,</line>
      <line>And oh ye clouds that far above me soared –</line>
      <line>Thou rising sun, thou blue rejoicing sky,</line>
      <line>Yea, every thing that is, and will be, free –</line>
      <line>Bear witness for me, whereso’er ye be,</line>
      <line>With what deep worship I have still adored</line>
      <line>The spirit of divinest Liberty!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When France in wrath her giant-limbs upreared,</line>
      <line>And, with an oath which smote air, earth and sea,</line>
      <line>Stamped her strong foot and said she would be free,</line>
      <line> Bear witness for me how I hoped and feared –</line>
      <line>With what a joy my lofty gratulation</line>
      <line>Unawed I sang, amid a slavish band –</line>
      <line>And when to whelm the disenchanted nation</line>
      <line>(Like fiends embattled by a wizard’s wand)</line>
      <line>The Monarchs marched in evil day,</line>
      <line>And Britain joined the dire array,</line>
      <line>Though dear her shores and circling ocean;</line>
      <line>Though many friendships, many youthful loves,</line>
      <line>Had swoln the patriot emotion</line>
      <line> And flung a magic light o’er all her hills and groves;</line>
      <line>Yet still my voice, unaltered, sang defeat</line>
      <line>To all that braved the tyrant-quelling lance –</line>
      <line>And shame (too long delayed) and vain retreat!</line>
      <line>For ne’er, oh Liberty, with partial aim</line>
      <line>I dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame,</line>
      <line>But blest the paeans of delivered France,</line>
      <line>And hung my head, and wept at Britain’s name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And what’, I said, ‘though Blasphemy’s loud scream</line>
      <line>With that sweet music of deliverance strove –</line>
      <line> Though all the fierce and drunken passions wove</line>
      <line>A dance more wild that e’er was maniac’s dream!</line>
      <line>Ye storms that round the dawning East assembled,</line>
      <line>The sun was rising, though ye hid his light!’</line>
      <line>And when (to soothe my soul, that hoped and trembled)</line>
      <line>The dissonance ceased, and all seemed calm and bright;</line>
      <line>When France her front, deep-scarred and gory,</line>
      <line>Concealed with clustering wreaths of glory;</line>
      <line>When, insupportably advancing,</line>
      <line>Her arm made mockery of the warrior’s ramp;</line>
      <line> While, timid looks of fury glancing,</line>
      <line>Domestic treason (crushed beneath her fatal stamp)</line>
      <line>Writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore;</line>
      <line>Then I reproached my fears that would not flee –</line>
      <line>‘And soon’, I said, ‘shall Wisdom teach her lore</line>
      <line>In the low huts of them that toil and groan!</line>
      <line>And, conquering by her happiness alone,</line>
      <line>Shall France compel the nations to be free.</line>
      <line>Till Love and Joy look round, and call the Earth their own.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Forgive me, Freedom – oh forgive those dreams!</line>
      <line> I hear thy voice, I hear thy loud lament,</line>
      <line>From bleak Helvetia’s icy caverns sent –</line>
      <line>I hear thy groans upon her bloodstained streams!</line>
      <line>Heroes, that for thy peaceful country perished –</line>
      <line>And ye that, fleeing, spot your mountain-snows</line>
      <line>With bleeding wounds – forgive me that I cherished</line>
      <line>One thought that ever blest your cruel foes!</line>
      <line>To scatter rage, and traitorous guilt,</line>
      <line>Where Peace her jealous home had built;</line>
      <line>A patriot-race to disinherit</line>
      <line> Of all that made their stormy wilds so dear;</line>
      <line>And with inexpiable spirit</line>
      <line>To taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer –</line>
      <line>Oh France, that mockest Heaven, adulterous, blind,</line>
      <line>And patriot only in pernicious toils!</line>
      <line>Are these thy boasts, champion of human kind?</line>
      <line>To mix with Kings in the low lust of sway,</line>
      <line>Yell in the hunt, and share the murderous prey,</line>
      <line>To insult the shrine of Liberty with spoils</line>
      <line>From freemen torn – to tempt, and to betray?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The sensual and the dark rebel in vain,</line>
      <line>Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game</line>
      <line>They burst their manacles, and wear the name</line>
      <line>Of Freedom graven on a heavier chain!</line>
      <line>Oh Liberty, with profitless endeavour</line>
      <line>Have I pursued thee many a weary hour</line>
      <line>But thou nor swellst the victor’s strain, nor ever</line>
      <line>Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power.</line>
      <line>Alike, from all, howe’er they praise thee</line>
      <line>(Nor prayer, nor boastful name delays thee) –</line>
      <line> Alike from Priestcraft’s harpy minions</line>
      <line>And factious Blasphemy’s obscener slaves</line>
      <line>Thou speedest on thy subtle pinions,</line>
      <line>The guide of homeless winds, and playmate of the waves!</line>
      <line>And there I felt thee – on the sea-cliff’s verge,</line>
      <line>OWhose pines, scarce travelled by the breeze above,</line>
      <line>Had made one murmur with the distant surge.</line>
      <line>Yes, while I stood and gazed, my temples bare,</line>
      <line>And shot my being through earth, sea and air,</line>
      <line>Possessing all things with intensest love,</line>
      <line>Oh Liberty, my spirit found thee there!</line>

      <line>Are guests by right of custom – old and young..</line>
      <line>Such were the days – of days long past I sing –</line>
      <line>When pride gave place to mirth without a sting,</line>
      <line> Ere tyrant customs strength sufficient bore</line>
      <line>To violate the feelings of the poor,</line>
      <line>To leave them distanced in the madding race</line>
      <line>Where’er refinement shows its hated face –</line>
      <line>Not causeless hated: ’tis the peasant’s curse,</line>
      <line>That hourly makes his wretched station worse,</line>
      <line>Destroys life’s intercourse, the social plan</line>
      <line>That rank to rank cements, as man to man.</line>
      <line>Wealth flows round him, Fashion lordly reigns;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet poverty is his, and mental pains.</line>
      <line>Methinks I hear the mourner thus impart</line>
      <line> The stifled murmurs of his wounded heart:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Whence comes this change, ungracious, irksome, cold?</line>
      <line>Whence the new grandeur that mine eyes behold,</line>
      <line>The widening distance that I darkly see?</line>
      <line>Has Wealth done this? Then Wealth’s a foe to me,</line>
      <line>Foe to our rights...</line>
      <line>Our annual feast, when Earth her plenty yields,</line>
      <line>O When crowned with boughs the last load quits the fields</line>
      <line>The aspect still of ancient joy puts on –</line>
      <line>The aspect only, with the substance gone.</line>
      <line>Where unaffected Freedom charmed the soul,</line>
      <line>The separate table and the costly bowl,</line>
      <line> Cool as the blast that checks the budding Spring,</line>
      <line>A mockery of gladness round them fling...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor reigns that joy, when hand in hand they join,</line>
      <line>That good old Master felt in shaking mine.</line>
      <line>Heaven bless his memory – bless his honoured name! –</line>
      <line>The poor will speak his lasting worthy fame.</line>
      <line> To souls fair-purposed, strength and guidance give –</line>
      <line>In pity to us, still let goodness live –</line>
      <line>Let Labour have its due! My cot shall be</line>
      <line>From chilling want and guilty murmurs free!</line>
      <line>Let Labour have its due – then peace is mine,</line>
      <line>And never, never shall my heart repine.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Once did she hold the gorgeous East in fee,</line>

      <line>A weight of languid speech, or at the same</line>

      <line>She was a negro woman driven from France,</line>
      <line>Rejected like all others of that race,</line>
      <line>Not one of whom may now find footing there.</line>
      <line>This the poor outcast did to us declare,</line>

    <title>‘Golden Hours’: Calais and the Rhone (from Prelude, VI)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas a time when Europe was rejoiced,</line>
      <line>France standing on the top of golden hours,</line>
      <line>And human nature seeming born again.</line>
      <line> Bound, as I said, to the Alps, it was our lot</line>
      <line>To land at Calais on the very eve</line>
      <line>Of that great Federal Day; and there we saw,</line>
      <line>In a mean city and among a few,</line>
      <line>How bright a face is worn when joy of one</line>
      <line>Is joy of tens of millions!</line>
      <line>Southward thence</line>
      <line>We took our way, direct through hamlets, towns,</line>
      <line>Gaudy with relics of that festival,</line>
      <line>Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs</line>
      <line>And window-garlands. On the public roads</line>
      <line> (And once three days successively through paths</line>
      <line>By which our toilsome journey was abridged)</line>
      <line>Among sequestered villages we walked,</line>
      <line>And found benevolence and blessedness</line>
      <line>Spread like a fragrance everywhere…</line>
      <line>Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw</line>
      <line>Dances of liberty, and in late hours</line>
      <line>Of darkness, dances in the open air.</line>
      <line>Among the vine-clad hills of Burgundy,</line>
      <line>Upon the bosom of the gentle Soane</line>
      <line> We glided forward with the flowing stream.</line>
      <line>Swift Rhone, thou wert the wings on which we cut</line>
      <line>Between thy lofty rocks! Enchanting show</line>
      <line>Those woods and farms and orchards did present,</line>
      <line>And single cottages and lurking towns –</line>
      <line>Reach after reach, procession without end</line>
      <line>Of deep and stately vales. A lonely pair</line>
      <line>Of Englishmen we were, and sailed along</line>
      <line>Clustered together with a merry crowd</line>
      <line>Of those emancipated, with a host</line>
      <line> Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning</line>
      <line>From the great spousals newly solemnized</line>
      <line>In their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.</line>
      <line>Like bees they swarmed – gaudy and gay as bees!</line>
      <line>Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,</line>
      <line>And flourished with their swords as if to fight</line>
      <line>The saucy air! In this blithe company</line>
      <line>We landed, took with them our evening meal,</line>
      <line>Guests welcome almost as the angels were</line>
      <line>To Abraham of old. The supper done,</line>
      <line>With flowing cups elate, and happy thoughts,</line>
      <line>We rose at signal given, and formed a ring</line>
      <line>And hand in hand danced round and round the board.</line>
      <line>All hearts were open, every tongue was loud</line>
      <line>With amity and glee. We bore a name</line>
      <line>Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,</line>
      <line>And hospitably did they give us hail</line>
      <line>As their forerunners in a glorious course –</line>
      <line>And round and round the board they danced again!</line>

    <title>A Tourist’s Unconcern: Paris (from Prelude, IX)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Through Paris lay my readiest path, and there</line>
      <line>I sojourned a few days and visited</line>
      <line>In haste each spot of old and recent fame –</line>
      <line>The latter chiefly – from the Field of Mars</line>
      <line>Down to the suburbs of St Antony,</line>
      <line> And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome</line>
      <line>Of Genevieve. In both her clamorous halls</line>
      <line>(The National Synod and the Jacobins)</line>
      <line>I saw the revolutionary power</line>
      <line>Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;</line>
      <line>The Arcades I traversed in the Palace huge</line>
      <line>Of Orleans, coasted round and round the line</line>
      <line>Of tavern, brothel, gaming-house and shop –</line>
      <line>Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walk</line>
      <line>Of all who had a purpose, or had not!</line>
      <line> I stared, and listened with a stranger’s ears</line>
      <line>To hawkers and haranguers (hubbub wild!)</line>
      <line>And hissing factionists with ardent eyes,</line>
      <line>In knots, or pairs, or single – ant-like swarms</line>
      <line>Of builders and subverters, every face</line>
      <line>That hope or apprehension could put on:</line>
      <line>Joy, anger and vexation, in the midst</line>
      <line>Of gaiety and dissolute idleness.</line>
      <line>Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust</line>
      <line>Of the Bastille I sat in the open sun</line>
      <line> And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,</line>
      <line>And pocketed the relic in the guise</line>
      <line>Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth</line>
      <line>Though not without some strong incumbencies,</line>
      <line>And glad – could living man be otherwise? –</line>
      <line>I looked for something which I could not find,</line>
      <line>Affecting more emotion than I felt.</line>

    <title>Among Royalists: Blois (from Prelude IX)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A knot of military officers</line>
      <line>That to a regiment appertained which then</line>
      <line>Was stationed in the city were the chief</line>
      <line>Of my associates; some of these wore swords</line>
      <line>Which had been seasoned in the wars, and all</line>
      <line>Were men well-born – at least, laid claim to such</line>
      <line>Distinction, as the chivalry of France.</line>
      <line>In age and temper differing, they had yet</line>
      <line> One spirit ruling in them all – alike</line>
      <line>(Save only one, hereafter to be named)</line>
      <line>Were bent upon undoing what was done!</line>
      <line>This was their rest, and only hope; therewith</line>
      <line>No fear had they of bad becoming worse,</line>
      <line>For worst to them had come – nor would have stirred,</line>
      <line>Or deemed it worth a moment’s while to stir,</line>
      <line>In any thing, save only if the act</line>
      <line>Looked thitherward.</line>
      <line>One, reckoning by years,</line>
      <line>Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile</line>
      <line> He had sat lord in many tender hearts,</line>
      <line>Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:</line>
      <line>His temper was quite mastered by the times,</line>
      <line>And they had blighted him, had eat away</line>
      <line>The beauty of his person, doing wrong</line>
      <line>Alike to body and to mind. His port,</line>
      <line>Which once had been erect and open, now</line>
      <line>Was stooping and contracted, and a face</line>
      <line>By nature lovely in itself, expressed,</line>
      <line>As much as any that was ever seen,</line>
      <line> A ravage out of season, made by thoughts</line>
      <line>Unhealthy and vexatious. At the hour,</line>
      <line>The most important of each day, in which</line>
      <line>The public news was read, the fever came,</line>
      <line>A punctual visitant, to shake this man,</line>
      <line>Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek</line>
      <line>Into a thousand colours, While he read,</line>
      <line>Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch</line>
      <line>Continually, like an uneasy place</line>
      <line>In his own body.</line>
      <line>’Twas in truth an hour</line>
      <line> Of universal ferment – mildest men</line>
      <line>Were agitated, and commotions, strife</line>
      <line>Of passions and opinion, filled the walls</line>
      <line>Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Among that band of officers was one,</line>
      <line> Already hinted at, of other mould –</line>
      <line>A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,</line>
      <line>And with an oriental loathing spurned</line>
      <line>As of a different caste. A meeker man</line>
      <line>Than this lived never, or a more benign…</line>
      <line>And when we chanced</line>
      <line>One day to meet a hunger-bitten girl</line>
      <line>Who crept along fitting her languid self</line>
      <line>Unto a heifer’s motion – by a cord</line>
      <line> Tied to her arm, and picking thus from the lane</line>
      <line>Its sustenance, while the girl with her two hands</line>
      <line>Was busy knitting in a heartless mood</line>
      <line>Of solitude – and at the sight my friend</line>
      <line>In agitation said, ‘’Tis against that</line>
      <line>Which we are fighting!’ I with him believed</line>
      <line>Devoutly that a spirit was abroad</line>
      <line>Which could not be withstood; that poverty,</line>
      <line>At least like this, would in a little time</line>
      <line>Be found no more; that we should see the Earth</line>
      <line> Unthwarted in her wish to recompense</line>
      <line>The industrious and the lowly child of toil,</line>
      <line>All institutes for ever blotted out</line>
      <line>That legalized exclusion, empty pomp</line>
      <line>Abolished, sensual state and cruel power</line>
      <line>(Whether by edict of the one or few),</line>
      <line>And finally, as sum and crown of all,</line>
      <line>Should see the people having a strong hand</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The state, as if to stamp the final seal</line>
      <line> On her security, and to the world</line>
      <line>Show what she was, a high and fearless soul –</line>
      <line>Or rather in a spirit of thanks to those</line>
      <line>Who had stirred up her slackening faculties</line>
      <line>To a new transition – had assumed with joy</line>
      <line>The body and the venerable name</line>
      <line>Of a republic. Lamentable crimes,</line>
      <line>’Tis true, had gone before this hour, the work</line>
      <line>Of massacre, in which the senseless sword</line>
      <line>Was prayed to as a judge. But these were past,</line>
      <line> Earth free from them for ever (as was thought),</line>
      <line>Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once –</line>
      <line>Things that could only show themselves, and die!</line>
      <line>This was the time in which, inflamed with hope,</line>
      <line>To Paris I returned. Again I ranged,</line>
      <line>More eagerly than I had done before,</line>
      <line>Through the wide city – and in progress passed</line>
      <line>The prison where the unhappy monarch lay,</line>
      <line>Associate with his children and his wife</line>
      <line>In bondage, and the Palace, lately stormed</line>
      <line> With roar of canon and a numerous host.</line>
      <line>I crossed (a black and empty area then)</line>
      <line>The Square of the Carroussel, few weeks back</line>
      <line>Heaped up with dead and dying – upon these</line>
      <line>And other sights looking as doth a man</line>
      <line>Upon a volume whose contents he knows</line>
      <line>Are memorable but from him locked up,</line>
      <line>Being written in a tongue he cannot read,</line>
      <line>So that he questions the mute leaves with pain</line>
      <line>And half upbraids their silence.</line>
      <line>But that night,</line>
      <line> When on my bed I lay, I was most moved</line>
      <line>And felt most deeply in what world I was.</line>
      <line>My room was high and lonely, near the roof</line>
      <line>Of a large mansion or hotel, a spot</line>
      <line>That would have pleased me in more quiet times –</line>
      <line>Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.</line>
      <line>With unextinguished taper I kept watch,</line>
      <line>Reading at intervals. The fear gone by</line>
      <line>Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.</line>
      <line>I thought of those September massacres,</line>
      <line> Divided from me by a little month,</line>
      <line>And felt and touched them, a substantial dread</line>
      <line>(The rest was conjured up from tragic fictions</line>
      <line>And mournful calendars of true history,</line>
      <line>Remembrances and dim admonishments):</line>
      <line>‘The horse is taught his manage, and the wind</line>
      <line>Of heaven wheels round and treads in his own steps!</line>
      <line>Year follows year, the tide returns again,</line>
      <line>Day follows day: all things have second birth –</line>
      <line>The earthquake is not satisfied at once!’</line>
      <line> And in such way I wrought upon myself</line>
      <line>Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried</line>
      <line>To the whole city, ‘Sleep no more!’ To this</line>
      <line>Add comments of a calmer mind, from which</line>
      <line>I could not gather full security,</line>
      <line>But at the best it seemed a place of fear</line>
      <line>Unfit for the repose of night,</line>
      <line>Defenceless as a place where tigers roam.</line>

    <title>War and Alienation: London and Wales (from Prelude X)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>When to my native land</line>
      <line>(After a whole year’s absence) I returned</line>
      <line>I found the air yet busy with the stir</line>
      <line>Of a contention which had been raised up</line>
      <line>Against the traffickers in negro blood –</line>
      <line>An effort which, though baffled, nevertheless</line>
      <line>Had called back old forgotten principles</line>
      <line>Dismissed from service, had diffused some truths,</line>
      <line>And more of virtuous feeling, through the heart</line>
      <line>Of the English people…</line>
      <line>For me that strife had ne’er</line>
      <line>Fastened on my affections – nor did now</line>
      <line>Its unsuccessful issue much excite</line>
      <line>My sorrow, having laid this faith to heart</line>
      <line>That if France prospered good men would not long</line>
      <line>Pay fruitless worship to humanity,</line>
      <line>And this most rotten branch of human shame</line>
      <line> (Object, it seemed, of a superfluous pains)</line>
      <line>Would fall together with its parent tree.</line>
      <line>Such was my then belief – that there was one,</line>
      <line>And only one, solicitude for all!</line>
      <line>And now the strength of Britain was put forth</line>
      <line>In league with the confederated host;</line>
      <line>Not in my single self alone I found,</line>
      <line>But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,</line>
      <line>Change and subversion from that hour. No shock</line>
      <line>Given to my moral nature had I known</line>
      <line> Down to that moment – neither lapse,</line>
      <line>Nor turn of sentiment, that might be named</line>
      <line>A revolution, save at this one time!</line>
      <line>All else was progress on the self-same path</line>
      <line>On which, with a diversity of pace,</line>
      <line>I had been travelling – this, a stride at once</line>
      <line>Into another region.</line>
      <line>True it is</line>
      <line>’Twas not concealed with what ungracious eyes</line>
      <line>Our native rulers from the very first</line>
      <line>Had looked upon regenerated France,</line>
      <line> Nor had I doubted that this day would come;</line>
      <line>But in such contemplation I had thought</line>
      <line>Of general interests only, beyond this</line>
      <line>Had never once foretasted the event.</line>
      <line>Now I had other business, for I felt</line>
      <line>The ravage of this most unnatural strife</line>
      <line>In my own heart. There it lay like a weight,</line>
      <line>At enmity with all the tenderest springs</line>
      <line>Of my enjoyments.</line>
      <line>I who with the breeze</line>
      <line>Had played, a green leaf on the blesséd tree</line>
      <line> Of my beloved country (nor had wished</line>
      <line>For happier fortune than to wither there),</line>
      <line>Now from my pleasant station was cut off,</line>
      <line>And tossed about in whirlwinds. I rejoiced –</line>
      <line>Yea, afterwards, truth painful to record,</line>
      <line>Exulted in the triumph of my soul,</line>
      <line>When Englishmen by thousands were o’erthrown,</line>
      <line>Left without glory on the field, or driven,</line>
      <line>Brave hearts, to shameful flight.</line>
      <line>It was a grief –</line>
      <line>Grief call it not, ’twas anything but that –</line>
      <line> A conflict of sensations without name,</line>
      <line>Of which he only who may love the sight</line>
      <line>Of a village-steeple as I do can judge,</line>
      <line>When in the congregation, bending all</line>
      <line>To their great Father, prayers were offered up</line>
      <line>Or praises for our country’s victories,</line>
      <line>And, mid the simple worshippers perchance</line>
      <line>I only, like an uninvited guest</line>
      <line>Whom no one owned, sat silent – shall I add</line>
      <line>Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come!</line>

    <title>‘Eternal Justice’: Morecambe Sands (Prelude X)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Friend, few happier moments have been mine</line>
      <line>Through my whole life than that when first I heard</line>
      <line>That this foul tribe of Moloch was o’erthrown</line>
      <line>And their chief regent levelled with the dust!</line>
      <line>The day was one which haply may deserve</line>
      <line>A separate chronicle. Having gone abroad</line>
      <line>From a small village where I tarried then,</line>
      <line>To the same far-secluded privacy</line>
      <line>I was returning. Over the smooth sands</line>
      <line> Of Levens’ ample estuary lay</line>
      <line>My journey, and beneath a genial sun…</line>
      <line> Without me and within as I advanced</line>
      <line>All that I saw, or felt, or communed with,</line>
      <line>Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small</line>
      <line>And rocky island near, a fragment stood –</line>
      <line>Itself like a sea-rock – of what had been</line>
      <line>A Romish chapel, where in ancient times</line>
      <line>Masses were said at the hour which suited those</line>
      <line>Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.</line>
      <line>Not far from this still ruin all the plain</line>
      <line>Was spotted with a variegated crowd</line>
      <line> Of coaches, wains, and travellers (horse, and foot),</line>
      <line>Wading beneath the conduct of their guide</line>
      <line>In loose procession through the shallow stream</line>
      <line>Of inland-water – the great sea meanwhile</line>
      <line>Was at safe distance, far retired.</line>
      <line>I paused</line>
      <line>Unwilling to proceed, the scene appeared</line>
      <line>So gay and cheerful – when, a traveller</line>
      <line>Chancing to pass, I carelessly enquired</line>
      <line>If any news were stirring. He replied</line>
      <line>(In the familiar language of the day)</line>
      <line> That Robespierre was dead. Nor was a doubt,</line>
      <line>On further question, left within my mind,</line>
      <line>But that the tidings were substantial truth –</line>
      <line>That he and his supporters all were fallen.</line>
      <line>Great was my glee of spirit, great my joy</line>
      <line>In vengeance, and eternal justice, thus</line>
      <line>Made manifest. ‘Come now, ye golden times’,</line>
      <line>Said I, forth-breathing on those open sands</line>
      <line>A hymn of triumph, ‘as the morning comes</line>
      <line>Out of the bosom of the night, come ye!</line>
      <line> Thus far our trust is verified: behold,</line>
      <line>They who with clumsy desperation brought</line>
      <line>Rivers of blood, and preached that nothing else</line>
      <line>Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might</line>
      <line>Of their own helper have been swept away!</line>
      <line>Their madness is declared and visible –</line>
      <line>Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth</line>
      <line>March firmly towards righteousness and peace.’</line>
      <line>Then schemes I framed more calmly when and how</line>
      <line>The madding factions might be tranquillized,</line>
      <line> And (through hardships manifold and long)</line>
      <line>The mighty renovation would proceed.</line>

      <line> Thou far-fled pasture, long evanished scene,</line>
      <line>Where Nature’s freedom spread the flowery green –</line>
      <line>Where golden kingcups opened into view,</line>
      <line>Where silver daisies charmed the raptured view,</line>
      <line>And tottering (hid among those brighter gems)</line>
      <line>Where silver grasses bent their tiny stems,</line>
      <line>Where the pale lilac mean and lowly grew</line>
      <line>Courting in vain each gazer’s heedless view,</line>
      <line>While cowslips, sweetest flowers upon the plain,</line>
      <line>Seemingly bowed to shun the hand in vain,</line>
      <line>Where lowing oxen roamed to feed at large</line>
      <line>And bleating there the shepherd’s woolly charge</line>
      <line>Whose constant calls thy echoing valleys cheered,</line>
      <line>Thy scenes adorned and rural life endeared –</line>
      <line>No calls of hunger pity’s feelings wound,</line>
      <line>’Twas wanton plenty raised the joyful sound!</line>
      <line>Thy grass in plenty gave the wished supply</line>
      <line>Ere sultry suns had waked the troubling fly</line>
      <line>Then blest retiring (by thy bounty fed)</line>
      <line>They sought thy shades and found an easy bed.</line>
      <line> But now, alas, those scenes exist no more,</line>
      <line>The pride of life with thee (like mine) is o’er:</line>
      <line>Thy pleasing spots, to which fond memory clings,</line>
      <line>Sweet cooling shades and soft refreshing springs –</line>
      <line>And though Fate’s pleased to lay their beauties by</line>
      <line>In a dark corner of obscurity,</line>
      <line>As fair and sweet they bloomed thy plains among</line>
      <line>As blooms those Edens by the poets sung,</line>
      <line>Now all laid waste by Desolation’s hand</line>
      <line>Whose curséd weapons levels half the land!</line>
      <line> Oh who could see my dear green willows fall,</line>
      <line>What feeling heart but dropped a tear for all!</line>
      <line>Accurséd Wealth, o’erbounding human laws,</line>
      <line>Of every evil thou remains the cause:</line>
      <line>Victims of want, those wretches such as me,</line>
      <line>Too truly lay their wretchedness to thee!</line>
      <line>Thou art the bar that keeps from being fed,</line>
      <line>And thine our loss of labour and of bread –</line>
      <line>Thou art the cause that levels every tree,</line>
      <line>And woods bow down to clear a way for thee!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I lay asleep in Italy</line>
      <line>There came a voice from over the sea,</line>
      <line>And with great power it forth led me</line>
      <line>To walk in the visions of poesy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I met Murder on the way –</line>
      <line>He had a mask like Castlereagh –</line>
      <line>Very smooth he looked, yet grim;</line>
      <line>Seven blood-hounds followed him:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All were fat, and well they might</line>
      <line>Be in admirable plight,</line>
      <line>For one by one, and two by two,</line>
      <line>He tossed them human hearts to chew</line>
      <line>Which from his wide cloak he drew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Next came Fraud, and he had on,</line>
      <line> Like Eldon, an ermined gown –</line>
      <line>His big tears (for he wept well)</line>
      <line>Turned to millstones as they fell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the little children, who</line>
      <line>Round his feet played to and fro,</line>
      <line>Thinking every tear a gem,</line>
      <line>Had their brains knocked out by them.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Clothed with the bible, as with light,</line>
      <line>And the shadows of the night,</line>
      <line>Like Sidmouth, next, Hypocrisy</line>
      <line> On a crocodile rode by.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And many more Destructions played</line>
      <line>In this ghastly masquerade,</line>
      <line>All disguised, even to the eyes,</line>
      <line>Like bishops, lawyers, peers, or spies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Last came Anarchy: he rode</line>
      <line>On a white horse, splashed with blood;</line>
      <line>He was pale even to the lips,</line>
      <line>Like Death in the Apocalypse.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he wore a kingly crown;</line>
      <line> And in his grasp a sceptre shone;</line>
      <line>On his brow this mark I saw –</line>
      <line>‘I am God, and King, and Law!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With a pace stately and fast,</line>
      <line>Over English land he passed,</line>
      <line>Trampling to a mire of blood</line>
      <line>The adoring multitude.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And a mighty troop around,</line>
      <line>With their trampling shook the ground,</line>
      <line>Waving each a bloody sword</line>
      <line> For the service of their Lord.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And with glorious triumph, they</line>
      <line>Rode through England proud and gay,</line>
      <line>Drunk as with intoxication</line>
      <line>On the wine of desolation.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O’er fields and towns, from sea to sea,</line>
      <line>Passed the Pageant swift and free,</line>
      <line>Tearing up, and trampling down;</line>
      <line>Till they came to London town.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And each dweller, panic-stricken,</line>
      <line> Felt his heart with terror sicken</line>
      <line>Hearing the tempestuous cry</line>
      <line>Of the triumph of Anarchy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For with pomp to meet him came</line>
      <line>Clothed in arms like blood and flame</line>
      <line>The hired murderers, who did sing</line>
      <line>‘Thou art God, and Law, and King!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We have waited, weak and lone,</line>
      <line>For thy coming, Mighty One!</line>
      <line>Our purses are empty, our swords are cold –</line>
      <line> Give us glory, and blood, and gold.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lawyers and priests, a motley crowd,</line>
      <line>To the earth their pale brows bowed;</line>
      <line>Like a prayer not over loud</line>
      <line>Whispering, ‘Thou art Law and God!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then all cried with one accord,</line>
      <line>‘Thou art King, and God, and Lord!</line>
      <line>Anarchy, to thee we bow,</line>
      <line>Be thy name made holy now!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Anarchy, the skeleton,</line>
      <line> Bowed and grinned to every one,</line>
      <line>As well as if his education</line>
      <line>Had cost ten millions to the nation.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For he knew the palaces</line>
      <line>Of our Kings were rightly his;</line>
      <line>His the sceptre, crown, and globe,</line>
      <line>And the gold-inwoven robe.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So he sent his slaves before</line>
      <line>To seize upon the Bank and Tower,</line>
      <line>And was proceeding with intent</line>
      <line> To meet his pensioned Parliament</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When one fled past, a manic maid,</line>
      <line>And her name was Hope, she said:</line>
      <line>But she looked more like Despair,</line>
      <line>And she cried out in the air:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘My father Time is weak and grey</line>
      <line>With waiting for a better day;</line>
      <line>See how idiot-like he stands,</line>
      <line>Fumbling with his palsied hands!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘He has had child after child,</line>
      <line> And the dust of death is piled</line>
      <line>Over every one but me –</line>
      <line>Misery, oh, misery!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then she lay down in the street,</line>
      <line>Right before the horses’ feet,</line>
      <line>Expecting, with a patient eye,</line>
      <line>Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>It grew – a shape arrayed in mail</line>

    <title>from The Vision of Judgment</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,</line>
      <line>And nodded o’er his keys – when, lo! there came</line>
      <line> A wondrous noise he had not heard of late,</line>
      <line>A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame,</line>
      <line>In short, a roar of things extremely great,</line>
      <line>Which would have made all save a saint exclaim;</line>
      <line>But he, with first a start and then a wink,</line>
      <line>Said, ‘There’s another star gone out, I think!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But ere he could return to his repose,</line>
      <line>A cherub flapped his right wing o’er his eyes –</line>
      <line>At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose.</line>
      <line>‘Saint Porter’, said the angel, ‘prithee rise’</line>
      <line> (Waving a goodly wing, which glowed as glows</line>
      <line>An earthly peacock’s tale, with heavenly dyes);</line>
      <line>To which the saint replied, ‘Well, what’s the matter?</line>
      <line>Is Lucifer come back, with all this clatter?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘No’, quoth the cherub, ‘George the Third is dead!’</line>
      <line>‘And who is George the Third?’ replied the apostle –</line>
      <line>‘What George? what Third?’ ‘The King of England’, said</line>
      <line>The angel. ‘Well he won’t find kings to jostle</line>
      <line>Him on his way! But does he wear his head?</line>
      <line>Because the last we saw here had a tussle,</line>
      <line> And ne’er would have got into Heaven’s good graces,</line>
      <line>Had he not flung his head in all our faces!’...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,</line>
      <line>Arriving like a rush of mighty wind</line>
      <line>Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan</line>
      <line>Some silver stream (say, Ganges, Nile, or Inde,</line>
      <line>Or Thames, or Tweed), and mid them an old man</line>
      <line>With an old soul, and both extremely blind,</line>
      <line>Halted before the gate, and in his shroud</line>
      <line>Seated their fellow traveller on a cloud.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> But bringing up the rear of this bright host</line>
      <line>A Spirit of a different aspect waved</line>
      <line>His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast</line>
      <line>Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved.</line>
      <line>His brow was like the deep when tempest-tossed –</line>
      <line>Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved</line>
      <line>Eternal wrath on his immortal face,</line>
      <line>And where he gazed a gloom pervaded space.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As he drew near he gazed upon the gate,</line>
      <line>Ne’er to be entered more by him or Sin,</line>
      <line> With such a glance of supernatural hate</line>
      <line>As made Saint Peter wish himself within –</line>
      <line>He pottered with his keys at a great rate,</line>
      <line>And sweated through his apostolic skin</line>
      <line>(Of course his perspiration was but ichor,</line>
      <line>Or some such other spiritual liquor).</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>The very cherubs huddled all together,</line>
      <line>Like birds when soars the falcon, and they felt</line>
      <line>A tingling to the tip of every feather,</line>

      <line>‘Sir’, replied Michael, ‘you mistake – these things</line>

      <line>At length, with jostling, elbowing, and the aid</line>
      <line>Of cherubim appointed to the post,</line>
      <line> The devil Asmodeus to the circle made</line>
      <line>His way (and looked as if his journey cost</line>
      <line>Some trouble). When his burden down he laid,</line>
      <line>‘What’s this?’ cried Michael, ‘Why, ’tis not a ghost!’</line>

      <line> Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rained),</line>
      <line>I saw a taper far below me wink,</line>

      <line>The latter yours, good Michael – so the affair</line>
      <line>Belongs to all of us, you understand.</line>
      <line>I snatched him up just as you see him there,</line>
      <line>And brought him off for sentence out of hand!</line>
      <line>I’ve scarcely been ten minutes in the air –</line>

      <line>A good deal like a vulture in the face,</line>
      <line>With a hook-nose and a hawk’s eye, which gave</line>
      <line>A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace</line>
      <line>To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,</line>
      <line>Was by no means so ugly as his case!</line>

      <line>He had written praises of a regicide:</line>

      <line>And then against them, bitterer than ever.</line>
      <line>For pantisocracy he once had cried</line>
      <line>Aloud (a scheme less moral than ’twas clever),</line>
      <line> Then grew a hearty anti-jacobin –</line>
      <line>Had turned his coat, and would have turned his skin!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had sung against all battles, and again</line>

      <line>Reviewing ‘the ungentle craft’, and then</line>
      <line>Became as base a critic as e’er crawled –</line>
      <line>Fed, paid, and pampered by the very men</line>
      <line>By whom his muse and morals had been mauled.</line>
      <line>He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose,</line>
      <line>And more of both than anybody knows!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line> He had written Wesley’s Life – here turning round</line>
      <line>To Satan, ‘Sir, I’m ready to write yours,</line>
      <line>In two octavo volumes, nicely bound,</line>
      <line>With Notes and Preface, all that most allures</line>
      <line>The pious purchaser! And there’s no ground</line>
      <line>For fear, for I can choose my own reviewers –</line>

      <line>Satan bowed and was silent. ‘Well, if you,</line>
      <line>With amiable modesty, decline</line>
      <line> My offer, what says Michael? There are few</line>
      <line>Whose Memoirs could be rendered more divine!</line>
      <line>Mine is a pen of all work – not so new</line>
      <line>As it was once, but I would make you shine</line>
      <line>Like your own trumpet! By the way, my own</line>
      <line>Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>But, talking about trumpets, here’s my Vision!</line>
      <line>Now you shall judge – all people – yes! You shall</line>
      <line>Judge with my judgment, and by my decision</line>
      <line>Be guided who shall enter Heaven, or fall!</line>
      <line>I settle all these things by intuition</line>
      <line>(Times present, past, to come – Heaven, Hell, and all),</line>
      <line>Like King Alfonso. When I thus see double</line>
      <line>I save the Deity some worlds of trouble!</line>

      <line>He ceased, and drew forth an MS – and no</line>
      <line>Persuasion on the part of devils, saints,</line>
      <line>Or angels, now could stop the torrent – so</line>
      <line>He read the first three lines of the Contents;</line>
      <line>But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show</line>
      <line>Had vanished, with variety of scents,</line>
      <line> Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang</line>
      <line>Like lightning off from his ‘melodious twang’</line>

      <line>Those grand heroics acted as a spell:</line>

      <line>The devils ran howling, deafened, down to Hell;</line>
      <line>The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions</line>
      <line>(For ’tis not yet decided where they dwell,</line>
      <line>And I leave every man to his opinions);</line>
      <line>Michael took refuge in his trump – but lo!</line>
      <line>His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known</line>
      <line>For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys,</line>
      <line>And at the fifth line knocked the poet down,</line>
      <line>Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease,</line>
      <line>Into his lake – for there he did not drown,</line>
      <line>A different web being by the Destinies</line>
      <line>Woven for the Laureate’s final wreath, whene’er</line>
      <line>Reform shall happen either here or there.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He first sank to the bottom (like his Works),</line>
      <line>But soon rose to the surface (like himself),</line>
      <line> For all corrupted things are buoyed like corks</line>
      <line>By their own rottenness, light as an elf</line>
      <line>Or wisp that flits o’er a morass! He lurks,</line>
      <line>It may be, still (like dull books on a shelf)</line>
      <line>In his own den, to scrawl some Life or Vision –</line>
      <line>As Welborn says, ‘the devil turned precisian’!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As for the rest (to come to the conclusion</line>
      <line>Of this true dream), the telescope is gone</line>
      <line>Which kept my optics free from all delusion,</line>
      <line>And showed me what I in my turn have shown.</line>
      <line> All I saw farther, in the last confusion,</line>
      <line>Was that King George slipped into Heaven, for one,</line>
      <line>And when the tumult dwindled to a calm</line>
      <line>I left him practising the hundredth psalm.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There rests a shade above yon town,</line>
      <line>A dark funereal shroud –</line>
      <line>’Tis not the tempest hurrying down,</line>
      <line>’Tis not a summer cloud.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The smoke that rises on the air</line>
      <line>Is as a type and sign,</line>
      <line>A shadow flung by the despair</line>
      <line>Within those streets of thine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That smoke shuts out the cheerful day,</line>
      <line>The sunset’s purple hues,</line>
      <line>The moonlight’s pure and purple ray,</line>
      <line>The morning’s pearly dews.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such is the moral atmosphere</line>
      <line>Around thy daily life:</line>
      <line> Heavy with care and pale with fear,</line>
      <line>With future tumult rife.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There rises on the morning wind</line>
      <line>A low appealing cry –</line>
      <line>A thousand children are resigned</line>
      <line>To sicken and to die!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We read of Moloch’s sacrifice,</line>
      <line>We sicken at the name,</line>
      <line>And seem to hear the infant cries –</line>
      <line>And yet we do the same!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And worse – ’twas but a moment’s pain</line>
      <line>The heathen altar gave,</line>
      <line>But we give years – our idol, Gain,</line>
      <line>Demands a living grave!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How precious is the little one</line>
      <line>Before his mother’s sight,</line>
      <line>With bright hair dancing in the sun,</line>
      <line>And eyes of azure light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He sleeps as rosy as the south</line>
      <line>(For summer-days are long),</line>
      <line> A prayer upon the little mouth,</line>
      <line>Lulled by his nurse’s song.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love is around him, and his hours</line>
      <line>Are innocent and free:</line>
      <line>His mind essays its early powers</line>
      <line>Beside his mother’s knee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When after-years of trouble come,</line>
      <line>Such as await man’s prime,</line>
      <line>How will he think of that dear home</line>
      <line>And childhood’s lovely time!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And such should childhood ever be –</line>
      <line>The fairy well – to bring</line>
      <line>To life’s worn, weary memory</line>
      <line>The freshness of its spring!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But here the order is reversed</line>
      <line>And infancy, like age,</line>
      <line>Knows of existence but its worst –</line>
      <line>One dull and darkened page,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Written with tears, and stamped with toil,</line>
      <line>Crushed from its earliest hour,</line>
      <line> Weeds darkening on the bitter soil</line>
      <line>That never knew a flower.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Look on yon child! It droops the head,</line>
      <line>Its knees are bowed with pain;</line>
      <line>It mutters from its wretched bed,</line>
      <line>‘Oh let me sleep again!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas ’tis time – the mother’s eyes</line>
      <line>Turn mournfully away –</line>
      <line>Alas, ’tis time the child must rise,</line>
      <line>And yet it is not day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The lantern’s lit – she hurries forth –</line>
      <line>The spare cloak’s scanty fold</line>
      <line>Scare screens her from the snowy north;</line>
      <line>The child is pale and cold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And wearily the little hands</line>
      <line>Their task accustomed ply,</line>
      <line>While daily some, mid those pale bands,</line>
      <line>Droop, sicken, pine, and die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Good God, to think upon a child</line>
      <line>That has no childish days,</line>
      <line> No careless play, no frolics wild,</line>
      <line>No words of prayer and praise!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Man from the cradle – ’tis too soon</line>
      <line>To earn their daily bread,</line>
      <line>And heap the heat and toil of noon</line>
      <line>Upon an infant’s head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To labour ere their strength be come,</line>
      <line>Or starve – is such the doom</line>
      <line>That makes of many an English home</line>
      <line>One long and living tomb?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Is there no pity from above –</line>
      <line>No mercy in those skies –</line>
      <line>Hath then the heart of man no love</line>
      <line>To spare such sacrifice?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh England, though thy tribute waves</line>
      <line>Proclaim thee great and free,</line>
      <line>While those small children pine like slaves</line>
      <line>There is a curse on thee!</line>

    <title>from A Voice from the Factories</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fondly familiar is the look she gives</line>
      <line>As he returns who forth so lately went,</line>
      <line>For they together pass their happy lives!</line>
      <line>And many a tranquil evening have they spent</line>
      <line>Since, blushing, ignorantly innocent,</line>
      <line>She vowed, with downcast eyes and changeful hue,</line>
      <line>To love him only. Love fulfilled hath lent</line>
      <line>Its deep repose; and when he meets her view</line>
      <line>Her soft look only says, ‘I trust – and I am true!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Scattered like flowers the rosy children play,</line>
      <line>Or round her chair a busy crowd they press,</line>
      <line>But at the father’s coming, start away</line>
      <line>With playful struggle for his loved caress,</line>
      <line>And jealous of the one he first may bless.</line>
      <line>To each a welcoming word is fondly said:</line>
      <line>He bends and kisses some; lifts up the less;</line>
      <line>Admires the little cheek, so round and red,</line>
      <line> Or smoothes with tender hand the curled and shining head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, let us pause, and gaze upon them now!</line>
      <line>Is there not one beloved and lovely boy</line>
      <line>With Mirth’s bright seal upon his open brow,</line>
      <line>And sweet fond eyes, brimful of love and joy –</line>
      <line>He, whom no measure of delight can cloy,</line>
      <line>The daring and the darling of the set –</line>
      <line>He who, though pleased with every passing toy</line>
      <line>(Thoughtless and buoyant to excess), could yet</line>
      <line>Never a gentle word or kindly deed forget.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And one, more fragile than the rest, for whom,</line>
      <line>As for the weak bird in a crowded nest,</line>
      <line>Are needed all the fostering care of home</line>
      <line>And the soft comfort of the brooding breast –</line>
      <line>One who hath oft the couch of sickness prest</line>
      <line>On whom the mother looks, as it goes by,</line>
      <line>With tenderness intense, and fear supprest,</line>
      <line>While the soft patience of her active eye</line>
      <line>Blends with ‘God’s will be done’, ‘God grant thou mayst not die!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And is there not the elder of the band,</line>
      <line> She with the gentle smile and smooth bright hair,</line>
      <line>Waiting, some paces back, content to stand</line>
      <line>Till these of love’s caresses have their share;</line>
      <line>Knowing how soon his fond parental care</line>
      <line>Shall seek his violet in her shady nook?</line>
      <line>Patient she stands, demure, and brightly fair,</line>
      <line>Copying the meekness of her mother’s look,</line>
      <line>And clasping in her hand the favourite storybook.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wake, dreamer – choose! To labour life away,</line>
      <line>Which of these precious little ones shall go</line>
      <line> (Debarred of summer-light and cheerful play)</line>
      <line>To that receptacle for dreary woe,</line>
      <line>The Factory Mill? Shall he, in whom the glow</line>
      <line>Of life shines bright, whose free limbs’ vigorous tread</line>
      <line>Warns us how much of beauty that we know</line>
      <line>Would fade when he became dispirited</line>
      <line>And pined with sickened heart, and bowed his fainting head?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or shall the quiet little one, whose voice</line>
      <line>So rarely mingles in their sounds of glee,</line>
      <line>Whose life can bid no living thing rejoice,</line>
      <line> But rather is a long anxiety –</line>
      <line>Shall he go forth to toil? – and keep the free</line>
      <line>Frank boy, whose merry shouts and restless grace</line>
      <line>Would leave all eyes that used his face to see</line>
      <line>Wistfully gazing towards that vacant space</line>
      <line>Which makes their fireside seem a lone and dreary place.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or, sparing these, send her whose simplest words</line>
      <line>Have power to charm, whose warbled, childish song,</line>
      <line>Fluent and clear and bird-like, strikes the chords</line>
      <line>Of sympathy among the listening throng –</line>
      <line> Whose spirits light, and steps that dance along,</line>
      <line>Instinctive modesty and grace restrain –</line>
      <line>The fair young innocent who knows no wrong,</line>
      <line>Whose slender wrists scarce hold the silken skein</line>
      <line>Which the glad mother winds – shall she endure this pain?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Away! The thought – the thought alone – brings tears!</line>
      <line>They labour, they, the darlings of our lives,</line>
      <line>The flowers and sunbeams of our fleeting years,</line>
      <line>From whom alone our happiness derives</line>
      <line>A lasting strength, which every shock survives –</line>
      <line> The green young trees beneath whose arching boughs</line>
      <line>(When failing energy no longer strives)</line>
      <line>Our wearied age shall find a cool repose –</line>
      <line>They toil in torture? No. The painful picture close!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ye shudder – nor behold the vision more!</line>
      <line>Oh, fathers! is there then one law for these,</line>
      <line>And one for the pale children of the poor –</line>
      <line>That to their agony your hearts can freeze,</line>
      <line>Deny their pain, their toil, their slow disease,</line>
      <line>And deem with false complaining they encroach</line>
      <line> Upon your time and thought? Is yours the ease</line>
      <line>Which misery vainly struggles to approach,</line>
      <line>Whirling unthinking by in Luxury’s gilded coach?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Examine and decide. Watch through his day</line>
      <line>One of these little ones! The sun hath shone</line>
      <line>An hour, and by the ruddy morning’s ray</line>
      <line>(The last and least) he saunters on alone.</line>
      <line>See where, still pausing on the threshold-stone</line>
      <line>He stands, as loath to lose the bracing wind –</line>
      <line>With wistful wandering glances backward thrown</line>
      <line> On all the light and glory left behind,</line>
      <line>And sighs to think that he must darkly be confined.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Enter with him. The stranger who surveys</line>
      <line>The little natives of that dreary place</line>
      <line>(Where squalid suffering meets his shrinking gaze),</line>
      <line>Used to the glory of a young child’s face,</line>
      <line>Its changeful light, its coloured sparkling grace</line>
      <line>(Gleams of Heaven’s sunshine on our shadowed Earth),</line>
      <line>Starts at each visage, wan, and bold, and base,</line>
      <line>Whose smiles have neither innocence nor mirth –</line>
      <line>And comprehends the sin, original from birth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There the pale orphan, whose unequal strength</line>
      <line>Loathes the incessant toil it must pursue,</line>
      <line>Pines for the cool sweet evening’s twilight length,</line>
      <line>The sunny play-hour and the morning’s dew –</line>
      <line>Worn with its cheerless life’s monotonous hue,</line>
      <line>Bowed down and faint and stupefied it stands,</line>
      <line>Each half-seen object reeling in its view,</line>
      <line>While its hot, trembling, languid little hands</line>
      <line>Mechanically heed the Taskmaster’s commands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> There, sounds of wailing grief and painful blows</line>
      <line>Offend the ear, and startle it from rest</line>
      <line>(While the lungs gasp what air the place bestows),</line>
      <line>Or misery’s joyless vice, the ribald jest,</line>
      <line>Breaks the sick silence. Staring at the guest</line>
      <line>Who comes to view their labour, they beguile</line>
      <line>The unwatched moment: whispers half-supprest,</line>
      <line>And mutterings low, their faded lips defile –</line>
      <line>While gleams from face to face a strange and sullen smile.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>These then are his companions! He, too young</line>
      <line> To share their base and saddening merriment,</line>
      <line>Sits by, his little head in silence hung,</line>
      <line>His limbs cramped up, his body weakly bent,</line>
      <line>Toiling obedient till long hours so spent</line>
      <line>Produce exhaustion’s slumber, dull and deep.</line>
      <line>The Watcher’s stroke – bold – sudden – violent!</line>
      <line>Urges him from that lethargy of sleep,</line>
      <line>And bids him wake to life – to labour, and to weep!</line>

      <line>The lassie I lo’e best:</line>
      <line> There’s wild-woods grow, and rivers row,</line>
      <line>And mony a hill between;</line>
      <line>But day and night my fancy’s flight</line>
      <line>Is ever wi’ my Jean!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I see her in the dewy flowers,</line>
      <line>I see her sweet and fair;</line>
      <line>I hear her in the tunefu’ birds,</line>
      <line>I hear her charm the air –</line>
      <line>There’s not a bonny flower that springs</line>
      <line>By fountain, shaw, or green;</line>
      <line> There’s not a bonny bird that sings,</line>
      <line>But minds me o’ my Jean!</line>

      <line>O’erwhelmed with sorrow, and sustaining long</line>
      <line>‘The proud man’s contumely, the oppressor’s wrong’,</line>
      <line>Languid despondency and vain regret,</line>
      <line>Must my exhausted spirit struggle yet?</line>
      <line> Yes! Robbed, myself, of all that fortune gave,</line>
      <line>Even of all hope (but shelter in the grave),</line>
      <line>Still shall the plaintive lyre essay its powers</line>
      <line>To dress the Cave of Care with Fancy’s flowers –</line>
      <line>Maternal love the fiend Despair withstand,</line>
      <line>Still animate the heart and guide the hand.</line>
      <line>May you, dear objects of my anxious care,</line>
      <line>Escape the evils I was born to bear,</line>
      <line>Round my devoted head while tempests roll!</line>
      <line>Yet there, where I have treasured up my soul,</line>
      <line> May the soft rays of dawning hope impart</line>
      <line>Reviving patience to my fainting heart –</line>
      <line>And when its sharp solicitudes shall cease,</line>
      <line>May I be conscious in the realms of peace</line>
      <line>That every tear which swells my children’s eyes,</line>
      <line>From sorrows past, not present ills arise.</line>
      <line>Then, with some friend who loves to share your pain</line>
      <line>(For ’tis my boast that some such friends remain),</line>
      <line>By filial grief, and fond remembrance prest,</line>
      <line>You’ll seek the spot where all my sorrows rest,</line>
      <line> Recall my hapless days in sad review</line>
      <line>(The long calamities I bore for you),</line>
      <line>And – with an happier fate – resolve to prove</line>
      <line>How well you merited your mother’s love.</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Thy spirits have a fainter flow,</line>
      <line>I see thee daily weaker grow –</line>
      <line>’Twas my distress that brought thee low,</line>
      <line>My Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thy needles, once a shining store</line>
      <line>(For my sake restless heretofore),</line>
      <line>Now rust disused, and shine no more,</line>
      <line>My Mary!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil</line>
      <line>The same kind office for me still,</line>
      <line> Thy sight now seconds not thy will,</line>

      <line>Have wound themselves about this heart,</line>
      <line>My Mary.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>Thy indistinct expressions seem</line>

      <line>My Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Thy silver locks, once auburn bright,</line>

      <line>For could I view nor them, nor thee,</line>

      <line>The sun would rise in vain for me,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Partakers of the sad decline,</line>
      <line>Thy hands their little force resign;</line>
      <line> Yet, gently prest, press gently mine,</line>
      <line>My Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then I feel that still I hold</line>
      <line>A richer store ten-thousandfold</line>

      <line>My Mary!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such feebleness of limbs thou prov’st</line>

      <line>Upheld by two! But still thou lov’st,</line>
      <line>My Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And still to love, though prest with ill,</line>
      <line>In wintry age to feel no chill,</line>
      <line>With me is to be lovely still,</line>
      <line>My Mary.</line>

      <line>But ah, by constant heed I know</line>
      <line>How oft the sadness that I show</line>
      <line>Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe,</line>
      <line>My Mary!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And should my future lot be cast</line>
      <line>With much resemblance to the past,</line>

      <line>If from my lips some angry accents fell,</line>
      <line>Peevish complaint, or harsh reproof unkind,</line>
      <line>’Twas but the error of a sickly mind</line>

      <line> And waters clear, of Reason! And for me,</line>
      <line>Let this my verse the poor atonement be –</line>
      <line>My verse, which thou to praise wert e’er inclined</line>
      <line>Too highly, and with a painful eye to see</line>
      <line>No blemish. Thou to me didst ever show</line>
      <line>Kindest affection, and wouldst oft-times lend</line>
      <line>An ear to the desponding love-sick lay,</line>
      <line>Weeping my sorrows with me, who repay</line>
      <line>But ill the mighty debt of love I owe,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Well, if the bard was weatherwise, who made</line>
      <line>The grand old Ballad of Sir Patrick Spens,</line>
      <line>This night, so tranquil now, will not go hence</line>
      <line>Unroused by winds, that ply a busier trade</line>
      <line> Than that which moulds yon clouds in lazy flakes,</line>
      <line>Or the dull sobbing draught, that drones and rakes</line>
      <line>Upon the strings of this Eolian lute,</line>
      <line>Which better far were mute.</line>
      <line>For lo! the new moon, winter-bright</line>
      <line>And overspread with phantom light –</line>
      <line>With swimming phantom light o’erspread</line>
      <line>But rimmed and circled with a silver thread –</line>
      <line>I see the old moon in her lap, foretelling</line>
      <line>The coming on of rain and squally blast!</line>
      <line> Oh Sara, that the gust even now were swelling,</line>
      <line>And the slant night-shower driving loud and fast!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear,</line>
      <line>A stifling, drowsy, unimpassioned grief</line>
      <line>That finds no natural outlet, no relief</line>
      <line>In word, or sigh, or tear –</line>
      <line>This, Sara, well thou knowst,</line>
      <line>Is that sore evil which I dread the most,</line>
      <line>And oftenest suffer! In this heartless mood,</line>
      <line>To other thoughts by yonder throstle wooed,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> That pipes within the larch-tree, not unseen</line>
      <line>(The larch, which pushes out in tassels green</line>
      <line>Its bundled leafits), wooed to mild delights</line>
      <line>By all the tender sounds and gentle sights</line>
      <line>Of this sweet primrose-month – and vainly wooed!</line>
      <line>Oh dearest Sara, in this heartless mood</line>
      <line>All this long eve, so balmy and serene,</line>
      <line>Have I been gazing on the western sky</line>
      <line>And its peculiar tint of yellow-green;</line>
      <line>And still I gaze and with how blank an eye!</line>
      <line> And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars,</line>
      <line>That give away their motion to the stars;</line>
      <line>Those stars, that glide behind them, or between,</line>
      <line>Now sparkling, now bedimmed, but always seen;</line>
      <line>Yon crescent moon, as fixed as if it grew</line>
      <line>In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue –</line>
      <line>A boat becalmed, dear William’s sky-canoe!</line>
      <line>I see them all, so excellently fair!</line>
      <line>I see, not feel, how beautiful they are.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My genial spirits fail –</line>
      <line> And what can these avail</line>
      <line>To lift the smothering weight from off my breast?</line>
      <line>It were a vain endeavour,</line>
      <line>Though I should gaze for ever</line>
      <line>On that green light which lingers in the west!</line>
      <line>I may not hope from outward forms to win</line>
      <line>The passion and the life whose fountains are within!</line>
      <line>These lifeless shapes, around, below, above,</line>
      <line>Oh what can they impart?</line>
      <line>When even the gentle thought that thou, my love,</line>
      <line> Art gazing now, like me,</line>
      <line>And seest the heaven I see –</line>
      <line>Sweet thought it is, yet feebly stirs my heart!</line>
      <line>Feebly, oh feebly – yet</line>
      <line>(I well remember it)</line>
      <line>In my first dawn of youth that fancy stole</line>
      <line>With many secret yearnings on my soul.</line>
      <line>At eve, sky-gazing in ‘ecstatic fit’,</line>
      <line>Alas (for cloistered in a city-school</line>
      <line>The sky was all I knew of beautiful),</line>
      <line> At the barred window often did I sit,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And oft upon the leaded school-roof lay,</line>
      <line>And to myself would say:</line>
      <line>There does not live the man so stripped of good affections</line>
      <line>As not to love to see a maiden’s quiet eyes</line>
      <line>Upraised and linking on sweet dreams, by dim connections</line>
      <line>To moon, or Evening Star, or glorious western skies –</line>
      <line>While yet a boy, this thought would so pursue me</line>
      <line>That often it became a kind of vision to me!</line>
      <line>Sweet thought, and dear of old</line>
      <line> To hearts of finer mould –</line>
      <line>Ten thousand times by friends and lovers blest!</line>
      <line>I spoke with rash despair,</line>
      <line>And, ere I was aware,</line>
      <line>The weight was somewhat lifted from my breast.</line>
      <line>Oh Sara, in the weather-fended wood –</line>
      <line>Thy loved haunt, where the stock-doves coo at noon –</line>
      <line>I guess, that thou hast stood</line>
      <line>And watched yon crescent, and its ghost-like moon.</line>
      <line>And yet, far rather in my present mood</line>
      <line> I would that thou’dst been sitting all this while</line>
      <line>Upon the sod-built seat of camomile –</line>
      <line>And, though thy robin may have ceased to sing,</line>
      <line>Yet needs for my sake must thou love to hear</line>
      <line>The beehive murmuring near,</line>
      <line>That ever-busy and most quiet thing</line>
      <line>Which I have heard at midnight murmuring.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I feel my spirit moved,</line>
      <line>And, wheresoe’er thou be</line>
      <line>Oh Sister, oh beloved,</line>
      <line> Those dear mild eyes that see</line>
      <line>Even now the heaven I see –</line>
      <line>There is a prayer in them – it is for me!</line>
      <line>And I, dear Sara, I am blessing thee!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was as calm as this, that happy night</line>
      <line>When Mary, thou, and I together were,</line>
      <line>The low decaying fire our only light,</line>
      <line>And listened to the stillness of the air!</line>
      <line>Oh that affectionate and blameless maid,</line>
      <line>Dear Mary – on her lap my head she laid!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her hand was on my brow</line>
      <line>(Even as my own is now),</line>
      <line>And on my cheek I felt thy eye-lash play.</line>
      <line>Such joy I had that I may truly say,</line>
      <line>My spirit was awe-stricken with the excess</line>
      <line>And trance-like depth of its brief happiness.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah fair remembrances, that so revive</line>
      <line>The heart, and fill it with a living power –</line>
      <line>Where were they, Sara? Or did I not strive</line>
      <line>To win them to me on the fretting hour –</line>
      <line> Then when I wrote thee that complaining scroll</line>
      <line>Which even to bodily sickness bruised thy soul!</line>
      <line>And yet thou blam’st thyself alone – and yet</line>
      <line>Forbidd’st me all regret!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And must I not regret that I distressed</line>
      <line>Thee, best beloved who lovest me the best?</line>
      <line>My better mind had fled I know not whither,</line>
      <line>For oh, was this an absent friend’s employ</line>
      <line>To send from far both pain and sorrow thither</line>
      <line>Where still his blessings should have called down joy!</line>
      <line> I read thy guileless letter o’er again,</line>
      <line>I hear thee of thy blameless self complain,</line>
      <line>And only this I learn (and this, alas, I know),</line>
      <line>That thou art weak and pale with sickness, grief and pain,</line>
      <line>And I – I made thee so!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh for my own sake I regret perforce</line>
      <line>Whatever turns thee, Sara, from the course</line>
      <line>Of calm well-being and a heart at rest!</line>
      <line>When thou, and with thee those whom thou lov’st best,</line>
      <line>Shall dwell together in one happy home,</line>
      <line> One house, the dear abiding home of all,</line>
      <line>I too will crown me with a coronal!</line>
      <line>Nor shall this heart in idle wishes roam</line>
      <line>Morbidly soft!</line>
      <line>No! Let me trust that I shall wear away</line>
      <line>In no inglorious toils the manly day,</line>
      <line>And only now and then, and not too oft,</line>
      <line>Some dear and memorable eve will bless</line>
      <line>Dreaming of all your loves and quietness.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Be happy, and I need thee not in sight –</line>
      <line> Peace in thy heart, and quiet in thy dwelling,</line>
      <line>Health in thy limbs, and in thine eyes the light</line>
      <line>Of love, and hope, and honourable feeling.</line>
      <line>Where’er I am, I shall be well content –</line>
      <line>Not near thee, haply shall be more content!</line>
      <line>To all things I prefer the permanent!</line>
      <line>And better seems it for a heart like mine</line>
      <line>Always to know, than sometimes to behold,</line>
      <line>Their happiness and thine;</line>
      <line>For change doth trouble me with pangs untold!</line>
      <line> To see thee, hear thee, feel thee, then to part,</line>
      <line>Oh, it weighs down the heart!</line>
      <line>To visit those I love, as I love thee,</line>
      <line>Mary, and William, and dear Dorothy,</line>
      <line>It is but a temptation to repine –</line>
      <line>The transientness is poison in the wine,</line>
      <line>Eats out the pith of joy, makes all joy hollow,</line>
      <line>All pleasure a dim dream of pain to follow!</line>
      <line>My own peculiar lot, my household life,</line>
      <line>It is, and will remain, indifference or strife –</line>
      <line> While ye are well and happy, ’twould but wrong you</line>
      <line>If I should fondly yearn to be among you.</line>
      <line>Wherefore, oh wherefore, should I wish to be</line>
      <line>A withered branch upon a blossoming tree?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But – let me say it, for I vainly strive</line>
      <line>To beat away the thought – but if thou pined,</line>
      <line>Whate’er the cause, in body or in mind,</line>
      <line>I were the miserablest man alive</line>
      <line>To know it and be absent! Thy delights</line>
      <line>Far off, or near, alike I may partake;</line>
      <line> But oh, to mourn for thee, and to forsake</line>
      <line>All power, all hope of giving comfort to thee –</line>
      <line>To know that thou art weak and worn with pain,</line>
      <line>And not to hear thee, Sara, not to view thee,</line>
      <line>Not sit beside thy bed,</line>
      <line>Not press thy aching head,</line>
      <line>Not bring thee health again</line>
      <line>(At least to hope, to try)</line>
      <line>By this voice, which thou lov’st, and by this earnest eye!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nay, wherefore did I let it haunt my mind,</line>
      <line> The dark distressful dream?</line>
      <line>I turn from it, and listen to the wind</line>
      <line>Which long has raved unnoticed. What a scream</line>
      <line>Of agony, by torture lengthened out,</line>
      <line>That lute sent forth! Oh thou wild storm without!</line>
      <line>agg’d rock, or mountain-pond, or blasted tree,</line>
      <line>Or pine-grove whither woodman never clomb,</line>
      <line>Or lonely house long held the witches’ home,</line>
      <line>Methinks were fitter instruments for thee,</line>
      <line>Mad lutanist, that in this month of showers,</line>
      <line> Of dark brown gardens and of peeping flowers,</line>
      <line>Mak’st Devil’s yule, with worse than wintry song</line>
      <line>The blossoms, buds, and timorous leaves among!</line>
      <line>Thou actor, perfect in all tragic sounds,</line>
      <line>Thou mighty poet, even to frenzy bold!</line>
      <line>What tell’st thou now about?</line>
      <line>’Tis of the rushing of an host in rout –</line>
      <line>And many groans from men with smarting wounds –</line>
      <line>At once they groan with smart, and shudder with the cold!</line>
      <line>’Tis hushed: there is a trance of deepest silence.</line>
      <line>Again! But all that sound, as of a rushing crowd,</line>
      <line>And groans and tremulous shudderings, all are over –</line>
      <line>And it has other sounds, and all less deep, less loud –</line>
      <line>A tale of less affright,</line>
      <line>And tempered with delight,</line>
      <line>As William’s self had made the tender lay:</line>
      <line>’Tis of a little child</line>
      <line>Upon a heathy wild,</line>
      <line>Not far from home, but it has lost its way,</line>
      <line>And now groans low in utter grief and fear,</line>
      <line> And now screams loud, and hopes to make its mother hear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis midnight, and small thoughts have I of sleep –</line>
      <line>Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep –</line>
      <line>Oh breathe she softly in her gentle sleep!</line>
      <line>Cover her, gentle sleep, with wings of healing.</line>
      <line>And be this tempest but a mountain-birth!</line>
      <line>May all the stars hang bright about her dwelling,</line>
      <line>Silent, as though they watched the sleeping earth!</line>
      <line>Healthful and light, my darling, mayst thou rise</line>
      <line>With clear and cheerful eyes –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And of the same good tidings to me send!</line>
      <line>For, oh, belovéd friend,</line>
      <line>I am not the buoyant thing I was of yore</line>
      <line>When, like an own child, I to joy belonged –</line>
      <line>For others mourning oft, myself oft sorely wronged,</line>
      <line>Yet bearing all things then, as if I nothing bore!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, dearest Sara, yes!</line>
      <line>There was a time when, though my path was rough,</line>
      <line>The joy within me dallied with distress,</line>
      <line>And all misfortunes were but as the stuff</line>
      <line> Whence fancy made me dreams of happiness;</line>
      <line>For hope grew round me like the climbing vine,</line>
      <line>And leaves and fruitage, not my own, seemed mine!</line>
      <line>But now ill tidings bow me down to earth –</line>
      <line>Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth,</line>
      <line>But oh, each visitation</line>
      <line>Suspends what nature gave me at my birth,</line>
      <line>My shaping spirit of imagination!</line>
      <line>I speak not now of those habitual ills</line>
      <line>That wear out life, when two unequal minds</line>
      <line> Meet in one house, and two discordant wills;</line>
      <line>This leaves me where it finds,</line>
      <line>Past cure and past complaint – a fate austere,</line>
      <line>Too fixed and hopeless to partake of fear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But thou, dear Sara (dear indeed thou art,</line>
      <line>My comforter! A heart within my heart!),</line>
      <line>Thou, and the few we love, though few ye be,</line>
      <line>Make up a world of hopes and fears for me.</line>
      <line>And if affliction, or distempering pain,</line>
      <line>Or wayward chance befall you, I complain</line>
      <line> Not that I mourn. Oh friends most dear, most true,</line>
      <line>Methinks to weep with you</line>
      <line>Were better far than to rejoice alone –</line>
      <line>But that my coarse domestic life has known</line>
      <line>No habits of heart-nursing sympathy,</line>
      <line>No griefs but such as dull and deaden me,</line>
      <line>No mutual mild enjoyments of its own,</line>
      <line>No hopes of its own vintage – none, oh none,</line>
      <line>Whence, when I mourned for you, my heart might borrow</line>
      <line>Fair forms and living motions for its sorrow.</line>
      <line> For not to think of what I needs must feel,</line>
      <line>But to be still and patient all I can,</line>
      <line>And haply by abstruse research to steal</line>
      <line>From my own nature all the natural man –</line>
      <line>This was my sole resource, my wisest plan!</line>
      <line>And that, which suits a part, infects the whole,</line>
      <line>And now is almost grown the temper of my soul.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My little children are a joy, a love,</line>
      <line>A good gift from above!</line>
      <line>But what is bliss, that still calls up a woe</line>
      <line> And makes it doubly keen,</line>
      <line>Compelling me to feel, as well as know,</line>
      <line>What a most blesséd lot mine might have been.</line>
      <line>Those little angel-children – woe is me! –</line>
      <line>There have been hours, when feeling how they bind</line>
      <line>And pluck out the wing-feathers of my mind,</line>
      <line>Turning my error to necessity, I have half</line>
      <line>Wished they never had been born!</line>
      <line>That, seldom – but sad thoughts they always bring,</line>
      <line>And like the poet’s Philomel I sing</line>
      <line> My love-song with my breast against a thorn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With no unthankful spirit I confess</line>
      <line>This clinging grief too, in its turn, awakes</line>
      <line>That love, and father’s joy; but oh, it makes</line>
      <line>The love the greater, and the joy far less!</line>
      <line>These mountains too, these vales, these woods, these lakes,</line>
      <line>Scenes full of beauty and of loftiness</line>
      <line>Where all my life I fondly hoped to live –</line>
      <line>I were sunk low indeed, did they no solace give;</line>
      <line>But oft I seem to feel, and evermore I fear,</line>
      <line> They are not to me now the things, which once they were.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Sara, we receive but what we give,</line>
      <line>And in our life alone does Nature live.</line>
      <line>Ours is her wedding garment, ours her shroud –</line>
      <line>And would we aught behold of higher worth</line>
      <line>Than that inanimate cold world allowed</line>
      <line>To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,</line>
      <line>Ah, from the soul itself must issue forth</line>
      <line>A light, a glory, and a luminous cloud</line>
      <line>Enveloping the earth!</line>
      <line>And from the soul itself must there be sent</line>
      <line>A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,</line>
      <line>Of all sweet sounds the life and element.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh pure of heart, thou needst not ask of me</line>
      <line>What this strong music in the soul may be,</line>
      <line>What and wherein it doth exist,</line>
      <line>This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist,</line>
      <line>This beautiful and beauty-making power!</line>
      <line>Joy, innocent Sara! Joy, that ne’er was given</line>
      <line>Save to the pure, and in their purest hour –</line>
      <line> Joy, Sara, is the spirit and the power</line>
      <line>That, wedding Nature to us, gives in dower</line>
      <line>A new Earth and new Heaven</line>
      <line>Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud!</line>
      <line>Joy is that strong voice, joy that luminous cloud –</line>
      <line>We, we ourselves rejoice!</line>
      <line>And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight –</line>
      <line>All melodies the echoes of that voice,</line>
      <line>All colours a suffusion of that light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sister and friend of my devoutest choice!</line>
      <line> Thou being innocent and full of love,</line>
      <line>And nested with the darlings of thy love,</line>
      <line>And feeling in thy soul, heart, lips, and arms</line>
      <line>Even what the conjugal and mother dove,</line>
      <line>That borrows genial warmth from those she warms,</line>
      <line>Feels in her thrilled wings, blessedly outspread –</line>
      <line>Thou, freed awhile from cares and human dread</line>
      <line>By the immenseness of the good and fair</line>
      <line>Which thou seest everywhere –</line>
      <line>Thus, thus shouldst thou rejoice!</line>
      <line> To thee would all things live from pole to pole,</line>
      <line>Their life the eddying of thy living soul.</line>
      <line>Oh dear! Oh innocent! Oh full of love!</line>
      <line>A very friend! A sister of my choice –</line>
      <line>Oh dear, as light and impulse from above,</line>
      <line>Thus mayst thou ever, evermore rejoice!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is the first mild day of March,</line>
      <line>Each minute sweeter than before;</line>
      <line>The redbreast sings from the tall larch</line>
      <line>That stands beside our door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> There is a blessing in the air</line>
      <line>Which seems a sense of joy to yield</line>
      <line>To the bare trees, and mountains bare,</line>
      <line>And grass in the green field.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My sister – ’tis a wish of mine –</line>
      <line>Now that our morning-meal is done</line>
      <line>Make haste, your morning task resign,</line>
      <line>Come forth and feel the sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Edward will come with you, and pray</line>
      <line>Put on with speed your woodland-dress,</line>
      <line> And bring no book – for this one day</line>
      <line>We’ll give to idleness!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No joyless forms shall regulate</line>
      <line>Our living calendar:</line>
      <line>We from today, my friend, will date</line>
      <line>The opening of the year.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love, now an universal birth,</line>
      <line>From heart to heart is stealing –</line>
      <line>From earth to man, from man to earth –</line>
      <line>It is the hour of feeling!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> One moment now may give us more</line>
      <line>Than fifty years of reason;</line>
      <line>Our minds shall drink at every pore</line>
      <line>The spirit of the season.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some silent laws our hearts may make,</line>
      <line>Which they shall long obey;</line>
      <line>We for the year to come may take</line>
      <line>Our temper from today.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And from the blesséd power that rolls</line>
      <line>About, below, above,</line>
      <line> We’ll frame the measure of our souls –</line>
      <line>They shall be tuned to love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then come, my sister, come I pray,</line>
      <line>With speed put on your woodland-dress,</line>
      <line>And bring no book – for this one day</line>
      <line>We’ll give to idleness.</line>

    <date>1800</date>
    <title>from Home at Grasmere</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mine eyes did ne’er</line>
      <line>Rest on a lovely object, nor my mind</line>
      <line>Take pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,</line>
      <line>But either she whom now I have, who now</line>
      <line>Divides with me this loved abode, was there</line>
      <line>Or not far off. Where’er my footsteps turned,</line>
      <line>Her voice was like a hidden bird that sang;</line>
      <line>The thought of her was like a flash of light</line>
      <line>Or an unseen companionship, a breath</line>
      <line>Or fragrance independent of the wind…</line>
      <line>The boon is absolute: surpassing grace</line>
      <line>To me hath been vouchsafed. Among the bowers</line>
      <line>Of blissful Eden this was neither given,</line>
      <line> Nor could be given – possession of the good</line>
      <line>Which had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,</line>
      <line>And dear imaginations realized</line>
      <line>Up to their highest measure, yea, and more…</line>
      <line>Long is it since we met to part no more,</line>
      <line>Since I and Emma heard each other’s call</line>
      <line>And were companions once again, like birds</line>
      <line>Which by the intruding fowler had been scared –</line>
      <line> Two of a scattered brood that could not bear</line>
      <line>To live in loneliness! ’Tis long since we,</line>
      <line>Remembering much and hoping more, found means</line>
      <line>To walk abreast, though in a narrow path,</line>
      <line>With undivided steps. Our home was sweet –</line>
      <line>Could it be less? If we were forced to change,</line>
      <line>Our home again was sweet; but still – for youth,</line>
      <line>Strong as it seems and bold, is inly weak</line>
      <line>And diffident – the destiny of life</line>
      <line>Remained unfixed…</line>
      <line>Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,</line>
      <line>When hitherward we journeyed, and on foot,</line>
      <line>Through bursts of sunshine and through flying snows,</line>
      <line>Paced the long vales. How long they were, and yet</line>
      <line>How fast that length of way was left behind –</line>
      <line>Wensley’s long vale and Sedbergh’s naked heights.</line>
      <line>The frosty wind, as if to make amends</line>
      <line> For its keen breath, was aiding to our course</line>
      <line>And drove us onward like two ships at sea!</line>
      <line>Stern was the face of Nature; we rejoiced</line>
      <line>In that stern countenance, for our souls had there</line>
      <line>A feeling of their strength. The naked trees,</line>
      <line>The icy brooks, as on we passed, appeared</line>
      <line>To question us. ‘Whence come ye? To what end?’</line>
      <line>They seemed to say. ‘What would ye?’ said the shower,</line>
      <line>‘Wild wanderers, whither through my dark domain?’</line>
      <line>The sunbeam said, ‘Be happy’. They were moved –</line>
      <line> All things were moved – they round us as we went,</line>
      <line>We in the midst of them.</line>
      <line>And when the trance</line>
      <line>Came to us as we stood by Hart-Leap Well,</line>
      <line>The intimation of the milder day</line>
      <line>Which is to come, the fairer world than this,</line>
      <line>And raised us up, dejected as we were</line>
      <line>Among the records of that doleful place</line>
      <line>By sorrow for the hunted beast who there</line>
      <line>Had yielded up his breath – the awful trance,</line>
      <line>The vision of humanity and of God</line>
      <line> The mourner, God the sufferer, when the heart</line>
      <line>Of his poor creatures suffers wrongfully –</line>
      <line>Both in the sadness and the joy we found</line>
      <line>A promise and an earnest that we twain,</line>
      <line>A pair seceding from the common world,</line>

      <line>Look, five blue eggs are gleaming there!</line>
      <line>Few visions have I seen more fair,</line>

      <line>More pleasing than that simple sight.</line>

    <title>‘Child of My Parents’ (1805 Prelude XIII)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Child of my parents, sister of my soul,</line>
      <line>Elsewhere have strains of gratitude been breathed</line>
      <line>To thee for all the early tenderness</line>
      <line>Which I from thee imbibed. And true it is</line>
      <line> That later seasons owed to thee no less;</line>
      <line>For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touch</line>
      <line>Of other kindred hands that opened out</line>
      <line>The springs of tender thought in infancy,</line>
      <line>And spite of all which singly I had watched</line>
      <line>Of elegance, and each minuter charm</line>
      <line>In Nature and in life, still to the last –</line>
      <line>Even to the very going-out of youth,</line>
      <line>The period which our story now has reached –</line>
      <line>I too exclusively esteemed that love,</line>
      <line> And sought that beauty, which (as Milton sings)</line>
      <line>Has terror in it. Thou didst soften down</line>
      <line>This over-sternness; but for thee, sweet friend,</line>
      <line>My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had been</line>
      <line>Far longer what by nature it was framed –</line>
      <line>Longer retained its countenance severe –</line>
      <line>A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds</line>
      <line>Familiar, and a favourite of the stars;</line>
      <line>But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,</line>
      <line>Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,</line>
      <line> And teach the little birds to build their nests</line>
      <line>And warble in its chambers.</line>
      <line>At a time</line>
      <line>When Nature, destined to remain so long</line>
      <line>Foremost in my affections, had fallen back</line>
      <line>Into second place, well pleased to be</line>
      <line>A handmaid to a nobler than herself –</line>
      <line>When every day brought with it some new sense</line>
      <line>Of exquisite regard for common things,</line>
      <line>And all the earth was budding with these gifts</line>
      <line>Of more refined humanity – thy breath,</line>
      <line> Dear sister, was a kind of gentler spring</line>
      <line>That went before my steps.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>She was a phantom of delight</line>
      <line>When first she gleamed upon my sight;</line>
      <line>A lovely apparition, sent</line>
      <line>To be a moment’s ornament;</line>
      <line> Her eyes as stars of twilights fair;</line>
      <line>Like twilights, too, her dusky hair;</line>
      <line>But all things else about her drawn</line>
      <line>From May-time and the cheerful dawn;</line>
      <line>A dancing shape, an image gay,</line>
      <line>To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I saw her upon nearer view,</line>
      <line>A spirit, yet a woman too!</line>
      <line>Her household motions light and free,</line>
      <line>And steps of virgin liberty;</line>
      <line> A countenance in which did meet</line>
      <line>Sweet records, promises as sweet;</line>
      <line>A creature not too bright or good</line>
      <line>For human nature’s daily food;</line>
      <line>For transient sorrows, simple wiles,</line>
      <line>Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now I see with eye serene</line>
      <line>The very pulse of the machine;</line>
      <line>A being breathing thoughtful breath;</line>
      <line>A traveller betwixt life and death;</line>
      <line> The reason firm, the temperate will,</line>
      <line>Endurance, foresight, strength and skill;</line>
      <line>A perfect woman; nobly planned,</line>
      <line>To warn, to comfort, and command;</line>
      <line>And yet a spirit still, and bright</line>
      <line>With something of an angel light.</line>

      <line>A gladness o’er that season, then to me</line>

      <line>That all the trees, and all the silent hills,</line>

      <line>That spot which no vicissitude can find?</line>
      <line> Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind –</line>
      <line>But how could I forget thee? Through what power</line>
      <line>Even for the least division of an hour</line>
      <line>Have I been so beguiled as to be blind</line>

      <line>Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore –</line>
      <line>Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn,</line>
      <line>Knowing my heart’s best treasure was no more,</line>

      <line>So now my summer task is ended, Mary,</line>

      <line>As to his Queen, some victor-knight of Fairy,</line>
      <line>Earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome.</line>
      <line> Nor thou disdain that ere my fame become</line>
      <line>A star among the stars of mortal night</line>
      <line>(If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom),</line>
      <line>Its doubtful promise thus I would unite</line>
      <line>With thy belovéd name, thou child of love and light!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The toil which stole from thee so many an hour</line>
      <line>Is ended – and the fruit is at thy feet!</line>
      <line>No longer where the woods, to frame a bower,</line>
      <line>With interlacéd branches mix and meet,</line>
      <line>Or where, with sound like many voices sweet,</line>
      <line> Waterfalls leap among wild islands green</line>
      <line>(Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat</line>
      <line>Of moss-grown trees and weeds), shall I be seen,</line>
      <line>But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear friend, when first</line>
      <line>The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.</line>
      <line>I do remember well the hour which burst</line>
      <line>My spirit’s sleep. A fresh May-dawn it was</line>
      <line>When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,</line>
      <line>And wept – I knew not why – until there rose</line>
      <line> From the near school-room voices that, alas,</line>
      <line>Were but one echo from a world of woes,</line>
      <line>The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.</line>
      <line>And then I clasped my hands and looked around –</line>
      <line>But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,</line>
      <line>Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground –</line>
      <line>So without shame I spoke: ‘I will be wise,</line>
      <line>And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies</line>
      <line>Such power, for I grow weary to behold</line>
      <line>The selfish and the strong still tyrannize</line>
      <line> Without reproach or check.’ I then controlled</line>
      <line>My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And from that hour did I with earnest thought</line>
      <line>Heap knowledge from forbidden mines or lore,</line>
      <line>Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught</line>
      <line>I cared to learn, but from that secret store</line>
      <line>Wrought linkéd armour for my soul, before</line>
      <line>It might walk forth to war among mankind!</line>
      <line>Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more</line>
      <line>Within me, till there came upon my mind</line>
      <line> A sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined...</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And what art thou? I know, but dare not speak –</line>
      <line>Time may interpret to his silent years!</line>
      <line>Yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek,</line>
      <line>And in the light thine ample forehead wears,</line>
      <line> And in thy sweetest smiles, and in thy tears,</line>
      <line>And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy</line>
      <line>Is whispered to subdue my fondest fears.</line>
      <line>And through thine eyes – even in thy soul – I see</line>
      <line>A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth</line>
      <line>(Of glorious parents) thou aspiring child!</line>
      <line>I wonder not, for one then left this Earth</line>
      <line>Whose life was like a setting planet mild</line>
      <line>Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled</line>
      <line>Of its departing glory. Still her fame</line>
      <line>Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild</line>
      <line>Which shake these latter days – and thou canst claim</line>
      <line>The shelter from thy sire of an immortal name!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit,</line>
      <line>Which was the echo of three thousand years,</line>
      <line>And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it</line>
      <line>As some lone man who in a desert hears</line>
      <line>The music of his home! Unwonted fears</line>
      <line>Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,</line>
      <line> And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,</line>
      <line>Like thunder-stricken dragons, for a space</line>
      <line>Left the torn human heart, their food and dwelling-place.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Truth’s deathless voice pauses among mankind!</line>
      <line>If there must be no response to my cry –</line>
      <line>If men must rise and stamp, with fury blind,</line>
      <line>On his pure name who loves them – thou and I,</line>
      <line>Sweet friend, can look from our tranquility</line>
      <line>Like lamps into the world’s tempestuous night,</line>
      <line>Two tranquil stars, while clouds are passing by</line>
      <line> Which wrap them from the foundering seaman’s sight,</line>
      <line>That burn from year to year with unextinguished light.</line>

      <line>These votive wreaths of withered memory.</line>
      <line> Poor captive bird! – who from thy narrow cage</line>
      <line>Pourest such music that it might assuage</line>
      <line>The rugged hearts of those who prisoned thee,</line>
      <line>Were they not deaf to all sweet melody –</line>
      <line>This song shall be thy rose. Its petals pale</line>
      <line>Are dead indeed, my adored nightingale,</line>
      <line>But soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,</line>
      <line>And it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.</line>
      <line>High spirit-wingéd heart! who dost for ever</line>
      <line>Beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,</line>
      <line> Till those bright plumes of thought (in which arrayed</line>
      <line>It over-soared this low and worldly shade)</line>
      <line>Lie shattered, and thy panting, wounded breast</line>
      <line>Stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest.</line>
      <line>I weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,</line>
      <line>Yet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.</line>
      <line>Seraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,</line>
      <line>Veiling beneath that radiant form of woman</line>
      <line>All that is insupportable in thee</line>
      <line>Of light, and love, and immortality.</line>
      <line> Sweet benediction in the eternal curse!</line>
      <line>Veiled glory of this lampless universe!</line>
      <line>Thou moon beyond the clouds! Thou living form</line>
      <line>Among the dead! Thou star above the storm!</line>
      <line>Thou wonder, and thou beauty, and thou terror!</line>
      <line>Thou harmony of Nature’s art! Thou mirror</line>
      <line>In whom, as in the splendour of the sun,</line>
      <line>All shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!</line>
      <line>Aye, even the dim words which obscure thee now</line>
      <line>Flash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow.</line>
      <line> I pray thee that thou blot from this sad song</line>
      <line>All of its much mortality and wrong</line>
      <line>With those clear drops, which start like sacred dew</line>
      <line>From the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,</line>
      <line>Weeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy –</line>
      <line>Then smile on it, so that it may not die.</line>

      <line>Will hide that love from its unvalued shame.</line>
      <line> Would we two had been twins of the same mother!</line>
      <line>Or that the name my heart lent to another</line>
      <line>Could be a sister’s bond for her and thee,</line>
      <line>Blending two beams of one eternity!</line>
      <line>Yet were one lawful and the other true,</line>
      <line>These names, though dear, could paint not (as is due)</line>
      <line>How beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me,</line>
      <line>I am not thine – I am a part of thee!</line>
      <line>Sweet lamp! my moth-like muse has burned its wings</line>
      <line>Or, like a dying swan who soars and sings,</line>
      <line> Young Love should teach Time, in his own grey style,</line>
      <line>All that thou art. Art thou not void of guile,</line>
      <line>A lovely soul formed to be blest and bless,</line>
      <line>A well of sealed and secret happiness,</line>

      <line>A solitude, a refuge, a delight?</line>
      <line> A lute, which those whom Love has taught to play</line>
      <line>Make music on, to soothe the roughest day</line>
      <line>And lull fond grief asleep? A buried treasure?</line>
      <line>A cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?</line>
      <line>A violet-shrouded grave of woe? I measure</line>
      <line>The world of fancies, seeking one like thee,</line>
      <line>And find – alas! mine own infirmity.</line>
      <line>She met me, stranger, upon life’s rough way,</line>
      <line>And lured me towards sweet death – as night by day,</line>
      <line>Winter by spring, or sorrow by swift hope,</line>
      <line> Led into light, life, peace. An antelope,</line>
      <line>In the suspended impulse of its lightness,</line>
      <line>Were less aethereally light. The brightness</line>
      <line>Of her divinest presence trembles through</line>
      <line>Her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew,</line>
      <line>Embodied in the windless heaven of June</line>
      <line>Amid the splendour-wingéd stars, the Moon</line>
      <line>Burns, inextinguishably beautiful –</line>
      <line>And from her lips, as from a hyacinth full</line>
      <line>Of honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops</line>
      <line> Killing the sense with passion, sweet as stops</line>
      <line>Of planetary music heard in trance.</line>
      <line>In her mild lights the starry spirits dance,</line>
      <line>The sunbeams of those wells which ever leap</line>
      <line>Under the lightnings of the soul – too deep</line>
      <line>For the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.</line>
      <line>The glory of her being, issuing thence,</line>
      <line>Stains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade</line>
      <line>Of unentangled intermixture, made</line>
      <line>By Love, of light and motion – one intense</line>
      <line> Diffusion, one serene omnipresence,</line>
      <line>Whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,</line>
      <line>Around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing</line>
      <line>With the unintermitted blood, which there</line>
      <line>Quivers (as in a fleece of snow-like air</line>
      <line>The crimson pulse of living morning quiver)</line>
      <line>Continuously prolonged, and ending never,</line>
      <line>Till they are lost, and in that beauty furled</line>
      <line>Which penetrates and clasps and fills the world,</line>
      <line>Scarce visible from extreme loveliness.</line>
      <line>Warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress</line>
      <line>And her loose hair, and where some heavy tress</line>
      <line>The air of her own speed has disentwined,</line>
      <line>The sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;</line>
      <line>And in the soul a wild odour is felt,</line>
      <line>Beyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt</line>
      <line>Into the bosom of a frozen bud.</line>
      <line>See where she stands! a mortal shape indued</line>
      <line>With love and life and light and deity,</line>
      <line>And motion which may change but cannot die –</line>
      <line> An image of some bright eternity;</line>
      <line>A shadow of some golden dream; a splendour</line>
      <line>Leaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender</line>
      <line>Reflection of the eternal moon of love</line>
      <line>Under whose motions life’s dull billows move;</line>
      <line>A metaphor of spring and youth and morning;</line>
      <line>A vision like incarnate April, warning,</line>
      <line>With smiles and tears, frost the anatomy</line>
      <line>Into his summer grave.</line>
      <line>Ah, woe is me!</line>
      <line>What have I dared? Where am I lifted? How</line>
      <line> Shall I descend, and perish not? I know</line>
      <line>That love makes all things equal: I have heard</line>
      <line>By mine own heart this joyous truth averred:</line>
      <line>The spirit of the worm beneath the sod,</line>
      <line>In love and worship, blends itself with God.</line>
      <line>Spouse! sister! angel! pilot of the fate</line>
      <line>Whose course has been so starless! Oh too late</line>
      <line>Belovéd! Oh too soon adored, by me!</line>
      <line>For in the fields of immortality</line>
      <line>My spirit should at first have worshipped thine,</line>
      <line> A divine presence in a place divine –</line>
      <line>Or should have moved beside it on this earth,</line>
      <line>A shadow of that substance, from its birth –</line>
      <line>But not as now. I love thee – yes, I feel</line>
      <line>That on the fountain of my heart a seal</line>
      <line>Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright</line>
      <line>For thee, since in those tears thou hast delight.</line>
      <line>We – are we not formed, as notes of music are,</line>
      <line>For one another, though dissimilar? –</line>
      <line>Such difference without discord, as can make</line>
      <line> Those sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake</line>
      <line>As trembling leaves in a continuous air?</line>
      <line>Thy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare</line>
      <line>Beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.</line>
      <line>I never was attached to that great sect,</line>
      <line>Whose doctrine is, that each one should select</line>
      <line>Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,</line>
      <line>And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend</line>
      <line>To cold oblivion – though it is in the code</line>
      <line>Of modern morals, and the beaten road</line>
      <line> Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,</line>
      <line>Who travel to their home among the dead</line>
      <line>By the broad highway of the world, and so</line>
      <line>With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,</line>
      <line>The dreariest and the longest journey go.</line>
      <line>True love in this differs from gold and clay,</line>
      <line>That to divide is not to take away.</line>
      <line>Love is like understanding, that grows bright</line>
      <line>Gazing on many truths; ’tis like thy light,</line>
      <line>Imagination! which from earth and sky,</line>
      <line> And from the depths of human fantasy,</line>
      <line>As from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills</line>
      <line>The universe with glorious beams, and kills</line>
      <line>Error, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow</line>
      <line>Of its reverberated lightning. Narrow</line>
      <line>The heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,</line>
      <line>The life that wears, the spirit that creates</line>
      <line>One object and one form, and builds thereby</line>
      <line>A sepulchre for its eternity.</line>
      <line>Mind from its object differs most in this:</line>
      <line> Evil from good; misery from happiness;</line>
      <line>The baser from the nobler; the impure</line>
      <line>And frail, from what is clear and must endure.</line>
      <line>If you divide suffering and dross, you may</line>
      <line>Diminish till it is consumed away;</line>
      <line>If you divide pleasure and love and thought,</line>
      <line>Each part exceeds the whole; and we know not</line>
      <line>How much, while any yet remains unshared,</line>
      <line>Of pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared.</line>
      <line>This truth is that deep well, whence sages draw</line>
      <line> The unenvied light of hope; the eternal law</line>
      <line>By which those live, to whom this world of life</line>
      <line>Is as a garden ravaged, and whose strife</line>
      <line>Tills for the promise of a later birth</line>
      <line>The wilderness of this Elysian earth.</line>
      <line>There was a being whom my spirit oft</line>
      <line>Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,</line>
      <line>In the clear golden prime of my youth’s dawn,</line>
      <line>Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,</line>
      <line>Amid the enchanted mountains and the caves</line>
      <line> Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves</line>
      <line>Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor</line>
      <line>Paved her light steps. On an imagined shore,</line>
      <line>Under the gray beak of some promontory,</line>
      <line>She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,</line>
      <line>That I beheld her not. In solitudes</line>
      <line>Her voice came to me through the whispering woods,</line>
      <line>And from the fountains, and the odours deep</line>
      <line>Of flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep</line>
      <line>Of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,</line>
      <line>Breathed but of her to the enamoured air;</line>
      <line>And from the breezes whether low or loud,</line>
      <line>And from the rain of every passing cloud,</line>
      <line>And from the singing of the summer-birds,</line>
      <line>And from all sounds, all silence. In the words</line>
      <line>Of antique verse and high romance – in form,</line>
      <line>Sound, colour – in whatever checks that storm</line>
      <line>Which with the shattered present chokes the past;</line>
      <line>And in that best philosophy, whose taste</line>
      <line>Makes this cold common Hell, our life, a doom</line>
      <line> As glorious as a fiery martyrdom;</line>
      <line>Her spirit was the harmony of truth.</line>
      <line>Then, from the caverns of my dreamy youth</line>
      <line>I sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,</line>
      <line>And towards the lodestar of my one desire,</line>
      <line>I flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight</line>
      <line>Is as a dead leaf’s in the owlet-light,</line>
      <line>When it would seek in Hesper’s setting sphere</line>
      <line>A radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,</line>
      <line>As if it were a lamp of earthly flame.</line>
      <line> But she, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,</line>
      <line>Passed, like a god throned on a wingéd planet</line>
      <line>Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,</line>
      <line>Into the dreary cone of our life’s shade;</line>
      <line>And as a man with mighty loss dismayed,</line>
      <line>I would have followed, though the grave between</line>
      <line>Yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen –</line>
      <line>When a voice said: ‘Oh thou of hearts the weakest,</line>
      <line>The phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.’</line>
      <line>Then I – ‘Where?’ The world’s echo answered ‘where?’</line>
      <line> And in that silence, and in my despair,</line>
      <line>I questioned every tongueless wind that flew</line>
      <line>Over my tower of mourning, if it knew</line>
      <line>Whither ’twas fled, this soul out of my soul;</line>
      <line>And murmured names and spells which have control</line>
      <line>Over the sightless tyrants of our fate;</line>
      <line>But neither prayer nor verse could dissipate</line>
      <line>The night which closed on her; nor uncreate</line>
      <line>That world within this chaos, mine and me,</line>
      <line>Of which she was the veiled divinity –</line>
      <line> The world I say of thoughts that worshipped her.</line>
      <line>And therefore I went forth, with hope and fear</line>
      <line>And every gentle passion sick to death,</line>
      <line>Feeding my course with expectation’s breath,</line>
      <line>Into the wintry forest of our life.</line>
      <line>And struggling through its error with vain strife,</line>
      <line>And stumbling in my weakness and my haste,</line>
      <line>And half bewildered by new forms, I passed,</line>
      <line>Seeking among those untaught foresters</line>
      <line>If I could find one form resembling hers,</line>
      <line> In which she might have masked herself from me.</line>
      <line>There, one whose voice was venomed melody</line>
      <line>Sat by a well, under blue nightshade bowers;</line>
      <line>The breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,</line>
      <line>Her touch was as electric poison – flame</line>
      <line>Out of her looks into my vitals came,</line>
      <line>And from her living cheeks and bosom flew</line>
      <line>A killing air, which pierced like honey-dew</line>
      <line>Into the core of my green heart, and lay</line>
      <line>Upon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray</line>
      <line> O’er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime</line>
      <line>With ruins of unseasonable time.</line>
      <line>In many mortal forms I rashly sought</line>
      <line>The shadow of that idol of my thought.</line>
      <line>And some were fair – but beauty dies away;</line>
      <line>Others were wise – but honeyed words betray;</line>
      <line>And one was true – oh! why not true to me?</line>
      <line>Then, as a hunted deer that could not flee,</line>
      <line>I turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,</line>
      <line>Wounded and weak and panting. The cold day</line>
      <line> Trembled, for pity of my strife and pain –</line>
      <line>When, like a noonday dawn, there shone again</line>
      <line>Deliverance! One stood on my path who seemed</line>
      <line>As like the glorious shape which I had dreamed</line>
      <line>As is the Moon (whose changes ever run</line>
      <line>Into themselves) to the eternal Sun,</line>
      <line>The cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven’s bright isles,</line>
      <line>Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles –</line>
      <line>That wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame</line>
      <line>Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,</line>
      <line> And warms not but illumines. Young and fair</line>
      <line>As the descended spirit of that sphere,</line>
      <line>She hid me, as the Moon may hide the night</line>
      <line>From its own darkness, until all was bright</line>
      <line>Between the heaven and earth of my calm mind,</line>
      <line>And, as a cloud charioted by the wind,</line>
      <line>She led me to a cave in that wild place,</line>
      <line>And sat beside me, with her downward face</line>
      <line>Illumining my slumbers, like the Moon</line>
      <line>Waxing and waning o’er Endymion.</line>
      <line> And I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,</line>
      <line>And all my being became bright or dim</line>
      <line>As the Moon’s image in a summer sea,</line>
      <line>According as she smiled or frowned on me –</line>
      <line>And there I lay, within a chaste cold bed.</line>
      <line>Alas, I then was nor alive nor dead –</line>
      <line>For at her silver voice came Death and Life,</line>
      <line>Unmindful each of their accustomed strife,</line>
      <line>Masked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,</line>
      <line>The wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,</line>
      <line>And through the cavern without wings they flew,</line>
      <line>And cried, ‘Away, he is not of our crew!’</line>
      <line>I wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.</line>
      <line>What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,</line>
      <line>Blotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips</line>
      <line>Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;</line>
      <line>And how my soul was as a lampless sea,</line>
      <line>And who was then its Tempest; and when she,</line>
      <line>The Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost</line>
      <line>Crept o’er those waters, till from coast to coast</line>
      <line> The moving billows of my being fell</line>
      <line>Into a death of ice, immovable;</line>
      <line>And then, what earthquakes made it gape and split,</line>
      <line>(The white Moon smiling all the while on it)</line>
      <line>These words conceal – if not, each word would be</line>
      <line>The key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!</line>
      <line>At length, into the obscure forest came</line>
      <line>The Vision I had sought through grief and shame.</line>
      <line>Athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns</line>
      <line>Flashed from her motion splendour like the morn’s,</line>
      <line> And from her presence life was radiated</line>
      <line>Through the gray earth and branches bare and dead,</line>
      <line>So that her way was paved, and roofed above</line>
      <line>With flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love,</line>
      <line>And music from her respiration spread</line>
      <line>Like light. All other sounds were penetrated</line>
      <line>By the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,</line>
      <line>So that the savage winds hung mute around;</line>
      <line>And odours warm and fresh fell from her hair</line>
      <line>Dissolving the dull cold in the frore air.</line>
      <line> Soft as an incarnation of the sun,</line>
      <line>When light is changed to love, this glorious one</line>
      <line>Floated into the cavern where I lay,</line>
      <line>And called my spirit, and the dreaming clay</line>
      <line>Was lifted by the thing that dreamed below</line>
      <line>As smoke by fire, and in her beauty’s glow</line>
      <line>I stood, and felt the dawn of my long night</line>
      <line>Was penetrating me with living light:</line>
      <line>I knew it was the Vision veiled from me</line>
      <line>So many years – that it was Emily.</line>
      <line> Twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth,</line>
      <line>This world of love, this me, and into birth</line>
      <line>Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart</line>
      <line>Magnetic might into its central heart;</line>
      <line>And lift its billows and its mists, and guide</line>
      <line>By everlasting laws, each wind and tide</line>
      <line>To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;</line>
      <line>And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave</line>
      <line>Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers</line>
      <line>The armies of the rainbow-wingéd showers;</line>
      <line> And, as those married lights, which from the towers</line>
      <line>Of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe</line>
      <line>In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe,</line>
      <line>And all their many-mingled influence blend,</line>
      <line>(If equal, yet unlike) to one sweet end –</line>
      <line>So ye, bright regents, with alternate sway</line>
      <line>Govern my sphere of being, night and day!</line>
      <line>Thou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;</line>
      <line>Thou, not eclipsing a remoter light;</line>
      <line>And, through the shadow of the seasons three,</line>
      <line> From spring to autumn’s sere maturity,</line>
      <line>Light it into the winter of the tomb,</line>
      <line>Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.</line>
      <line>Thou too, oh Comet beautiful and fierce,</line>
      <line>Who drew the heart of this frail universe</line>
      <line>Towards thine own, till, wrecked in that convulsion,</line>
      <line>Alternating attraction and repulsion,</line>
      <line>Thine went astray and that was rent in twain,</line>
      <line>Oh, float into our azure heaven again!</line>
      <line>Be there love’s folding-star at thy return;</line>
      <line> The living sun will feed thee from its urn</line>
      <line>Of golden fire; the moon will veil her horn</line>
      <line>In thy last smiles; adoring even and morn</line>
      <line>Will worship thee with incense of calm breath</line>
      <line>And lights and shadows. As the star of death</line>
      <line>And birth is worshipped by those sisters wild</line>
      <line>Called Hope and Fear – upon the heart are piled</line>
      <line>Their offerings – of this sacrifice divine</line>
      <line>A world shall be the altar.</line>
      <line>Lady mine,</line>
      <line>Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth</line>
      <line> Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth</line>
      <line>Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,</line>
      <line>Will be as of the trees of Paradise.</line>
      <line>The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.</line>
      <line>To whatsoe’er of dull mortality</line>
      <line>Is mine, remain a vestal sister still;</line>
      <line>To the intense, the deep, the imperishable,</line>
      <line>Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united</line>
      <line>Even as a bride, delighting and delighted.</line>
      <line>The hour is come – the destined star has risen</line>
      <line> Which shall descend upon a vacant prison.</line>
      <line>The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set</line>
      <line>The sentinels – but true love never yet</line>
      <line>Was thus constrained. It overleaps all fence –</line>
      <line>Like lightning, with invisible violence</line>
      <line>Piercing its continents; like Heaven’s free breath,</line>
      <line>Which he who grasps can hold not; like Death,</line>
      <line>Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way</line>
      <line>Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array</line>
      <line>Of arms. More strength has love than he or they;</line>
      <line>For it can burst his charnel, and make free</line>
      <line>The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,</line>
      <line>The soul in dust and chaos.</line>
      <line>Emily,</line>
      <line>A ship is floating in the harbour now,</line>
      <line>A wind is hovering o’er the mountain’s brow;</line>
      <line>There is a path on the sea’s azure floor –</line>
      <line>No keel has ever ploughed that path before!</line>
      <line>The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;</line>
      <line>The treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles;</line>
      <line>The merry mariners are bold and free –</line>
      <line> Say, my heart’s sister, wilt thou sail with me?</line>
      <line>Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest</line>
      <line>Is a far Eden of the purple east;</line>
      <line>And we between her wings will sit, while night,</line>
      <line>And day, and storm, and calm, pursue their flight,</line>
      <line>Our ministers, along the boundless sea,</line>
      <line>Treading each other’s heels, unheededly.</line>
      <line>It is an isle under Ionian skies,</line>
      <line>Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,</line>
      <line>And, for the harbours are not safe and good,</line>
      <line> This land would have remained a solitude</line>
      <line>But for some pastoral people native there,</line>
      <line>Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air</line>
      <line>Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,</line>
      <line>Simple and spirited, innocent and bold.</line>
      <line>The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,</line>
      <line>With ever-changing sound and light and foam,</line>
      <line>Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar –</line>
      <line>And all the winds wandering along the shore</line>
      <line>Undulate with the undulating tide.</line>
      <line> There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;</line>
      <line>And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,</line>
      <line>As clear as elemental diamond,</line>
      <line>Or serene morning air; and, far beyond,</line>
      <line>The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer</line>
      <line>(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)</line>
      <line>Pierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls</line>
      <line>Built round with ivy, which, the waterfalls</line>
      <line>Illumining, with sound that never fails</line>
      <line>Accompany the noonday nightingales,</line>
      <line> And all the place is peopled with sweet airs.</line>
      <line>The light clear element which the isle wears</line>
      <line>Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,</line>
      <line>Which floats like mist, laden with unseen showers,</line>
      <line>And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;</line>
      <line>And from the moss violets and jonquils peep,</line>
      <line>And dart their arrowy odour through the brain</line>
      <line>Till you might faint with that delicious pain.</line>
      <line>And every motion, odour, beam, and tone,</line>
      <line>With that deep music is in unison</line>
      <line> Which is a soul within the soul – they seem</line>
      <line>Like echoes of an antenatal dream.</line>
      <line>It is an isle ’twixt heaven, air, earth, and sea,</line>
      <line>Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;</line>
      <line>Bright as that wandering Eden, Lucifer,</line>
      <line>Washed by the soft blue oceans of young air.</line>
      <line>It is a favoured place. Famine or blight,</line>
      <line>Pestilence, war and earthquake, never light</line>
      <line>Upon its mountain-peaks – blind vultures, they</line>
      <line>Sail onward far upon their fatal way!</line>
      <line> The wingéd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm</line>
      <line>To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm</line>
      <line>Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,</line>
      <line>From which its fields and woods ever renew</line>
      <line>Their green and golden immortality.</line>
      <line>And from the sea there rise, and from the sky</line>
      <line>There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,</line>
      <line>Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,</line>
      <line>Which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside,</line>
      <line>Till the isle’s beauty, like a naked bride</line>
      <line> Glowing at once with love and loveliness,</line>
      <line>Blushes and trembles at its own excess!</line>
      <line>Yet, like a buried lamp, a soul no less</line>
      <line>Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,</line>
      <line>An atom of the Eternal, whose own smile</line>
      <line>Unfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen</line>
      <line>O’er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,</line>
      <line>Filling their bare and void interstices.</line>
      <line>But the chief marvel of the wilderness</line>
      <line>Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how</line>
      <line> None of the rustic island-people know:</line>
      <line>’Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height</line>
      <line>It overtops the woods; but, for delight,</line>
      <line>Some wise and tender ocean-king, ere crime</line>
      <line>Had been invented, in the world’s young prime,</line>
      <line>Reared it, a wonder of that simple time,</line>
      <line>An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house</line>
      <line>Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.</line>
      <line>It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,</line>
      <line>But, as it were titanic; in the heart</line>
      <line> Of earth having assumed its form, then grown</line>
      <line>Out of the mountains, from the living stone,</line>
      <line>Lifting itself in caverns light and high –</line>
      <line>For all the antique and learnéd imagery</line>
      <line>Has been erased, and in the place of it</line>
      <line>The ivy and the wild-vine interknit</line>
      <line>The volumes of their many-twining stems.</line>
      <line>Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems</line>
      <line>The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky</line>
      <line>Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery</line>
      <line>With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,</line>
      <line>Or fragments of the day’s intense serene,</line>
      <line>Working mosaic on their Parian floors.</line>
      <line>And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers</line>
      <line>And terraces, the earth and ocean seem</line>
      <line>To sleep in one another’s arms, and dream</line>
      <line>Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we</line>
      <line>Read in their smiles, and call reality.</line>
      <line>This isle and house are mine, and I have vowed</line>
      <line>Thee to be lady of the solitude –</line>
      <line> And I have fitted up some chambers there</line>
      <line>Looking towards the golden eastern air,</line>
      <line>And level with the living winds, which flow</line>
      <line>Like waves above the living waves below.</line>
      <line>I have sent books and music there, and all</line>
      <line>Those instruments with which high spirits call</line>
      <line>The future from its cradle, and the past</line>
      <line>Out of its grave, and make the present last</line>
      <line>In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,</line>
      <line>Folded within their own eternity.</line>
      <line> Our simple life wants little, and true taste</line>
      <line>Hires not the pale drudge, luxury, to waste</line>
      <line>The scene it would adorn – and therefore, still,</line>
      <line>Nature with all her children haunts the hill.</line>
      <line>The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet</line>
      <line>Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit</line>
      <line>Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance</line>
      <line>Between the quick bats in their twilight dance;</line>
      <line>The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight</line>
      <line>Before our gate, and the slow, silent night</line>
      <line> Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.</line>
      <line>Be this our home in life, and when years heap</line>
      <line>Their withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,</line>
      <line>Let us become the overhanging day,</line>
      <line>The living soul of this Elysian isle,</line>
      <line>Conscious, inseparable, one.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile</line>
      <line>We two will rise, and sit, and walk together,</line>
      <line>Under the roof of blue Ionian weather,</line>
      <line>And wander in the meadows, or ascend</line>
      <line>The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend</line>
      <line> With lightest winds, to touch their paramour;</line>
      <line>Or linger where the pebble-paven shore,</line>
      <line>Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea</line>
      <line>Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,</line>
      <line>Possessing and possessed by all that is</line>
      <line>Within that calm circumference of bliss,</line>
      <line>And by each other, till to love and live</line>
      <line>Be one; or, at the noontide hour, arrive</line>
      <line>Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep</line>
      <line>The moonlight of the expiréd night asleep,</line>
      <line> Through which the awakened day can never peep –</line>
      <line>A veil for our seclusion, close as night’s,</line>
      <line>Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights –</line>
      <line>Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain</line>
      <line>Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again!</line>
      <line>And we will talk, until thought’s melody</line>
      <line>Become too sweet for utterance, and it die</line>
      <line>In words, to live again in looks, which dart</line>
      <line>With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,</line>
      <line>Harmonizing silence without a sound.</line>
      <line> Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,</line>
      <line>And our veins beat together, and our lips</line>
      <line>With other eloquence than words eclipse</line>
      <line>The soul that burns between them – and the wells</line>
      <line>Which boil under our being’s inmost cells,</line>
      <line>The fountains of our deepest life, shall be</line>
      <line>Confused in passion’s golden purity,</line>
      <line>As mountain-springs under the morning sun.</line>
      <line>We shall become the same, we shall be one</line>
      <line>Spirit within two frames! – oh, wherefore two? –</line>
      <line> One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,</line>
      <line>Till like two meteors of expanding flame,</line>
      <line>Those spheres instinct with it become the same,</line>
      <line>Touch, mingle, are transfigured – ever still</line>
      <line>Burning, yet ever inconsumable;</line>
      <line>In one another’s substance finding food,</line>
      <line>Like flames too pure and light and unimbued</line>
      <line>To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,</line>
      <line>Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:</line>
      <line>One hope within two wills, one will beneath</line>
      <line> Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,</line>
      <line>One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,</line>
      <line>And one annihilation. Woe is me!</line>
      <line>The wingéd words on which my soul would pierce</line>
      <line>Into the height of love’s rare universe,</line>
      <line>Are chains of lead around its flight of fire –</line>
      <line>I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Weak verses, go, kneel at your Sovereign’s feet,</line>
      <line>And say: ‘We are the masters of thy slave;</line>
      <line>What wouldést thou with us and ours and thine?’</line>
      <line> Then call your sisters from oblivion’s cave,</line>
      <line>All singing loud: ‘Love’s very pain is sweet,</line>
      <line>But its reward is in the world divine</line>
      <line>Which, if not here, it builds beyond the grave.</line>
      <line>So shall ye live when I am there. Then haste</line>
      <line>Over the hearts of men, until ye meet</line>
      <line>Marina, Vanna, Primus and the rest,</line>
      <line>And bid them love each other and be blest:</line>
      <line>And leave the troop which errs, and which reproves,</line>
      <line>And come and be my guest – for I am Love’s!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Ariel to Miranda – Take</line>
      <line>This slave of music for the sake</line>
      <line>Of him who is the slave of thee,</line>
      <line>And teach it all the harmony</line>
      <line> In which thou canst, and only thou,</line>
      <line>Make the delighted spirit glow</line>
      <line>Till joy denies itself again</line>
      <line>And, too intense, is turned to pain –</line>
      <line>For by permission and command</line>
      <line>Of thine own Prince Ferdinand</line>
      <line>Poor Ariel sends this silent token</line>
      <line>Of more than ever can be spoken –</line>
      <line>Your guardian-spirit Ariel, who</line>
      <line>From life to life must still pursue</line>
      <line> Your happiness, for thus alone</line>
      <line>Can Ariel ever find his own.</line>
      <line>From Prospero’s enchanted cell,</line>
      <line>As the mighty verses tell,</line>
      <line>To the throne of Naples he</line>
      <line>Lit you o’er the trackless sea,</line>
      <line>Flitting on, your prow before,</line>
      <line>Like a living meteor.</line>
      <line>When you die, the silent Moon</line>
      <line>In her interlunar swoon</line>
      <line> Is not sadder in her cell</line>
      <line>Than deserted Ariel:</line>
      <line>When you live again on Earth,</line>
      <line>Like an unseen star of birth</line>
      <line>Ariel guides you o’er the sea</line>
      <line>Of life from your nativity!</line>
      <line>Many changes have been rung</line>
      <line>Since Ferdinand and you begun</line>
      <line>Your course of love, and Ariel still</line>
      <line>Has tracked your steps and served your will.</line>
      <line> Now, in a humbler, happier lot,</line>
      <line>This is all remembered not,</line>
      <line>And now, alas, the poor sprite is</line>
      <line>Imprisoned for some fault of his</line>
      <line>In a body like a grave –</line>
      <line>From you he only dares to crave</line>
      <line>For his service and his sorrow</line>
      <line>A smile today, a song tomorrow!</line>
      <line>The artist who this idol wrought</line>
      <line>To echo all harmonious thought</line>
      <line> Felled a tree, while on the steep</line>
      <line>The woods were in their winter sleep,</line>
      <line>Rocked in that repose divine</line>
      <line>On the wind-swept Apennine</line>
      <line>(And dreaming, some, of autumn past,</line>
      <line>And some of spring approaching fast,</line>
      <line>And some of April buds and showers,</line>
      <line>And some of songs in July bowers,</line>
      <line>And all, of love), and so this tree –</line>
      <line>Oh that such our death may be! –</line>
      <line> Died in sleep, and felt no pain,</line>
      <line>To live in happier form again,</line>
      <line>From which, beneath heaven’s fairest star,</line>
      <line>The artist wrought this loved guitar,</line>
      <line>And taught it justly to reply</line>
      <line>To all who question skilfully</line>
      <line>In language gentle as their own,</line>
      <line>Whispering in enamoured tone</line>
      <line>Sweet oracles of woods and dells</line>
      <line>And summer-winds in sylvan cells –</line>
      <line> For it had learnt all harmonies</line>
      <line>Of the plains and of the skies,</line>
      <line>Of the forests and the mountains,</line>
      <line>And the many-voicéd fountains:</line>
      <line>The clearest echoes of the hills,</line>
      <line>The softest notes of falling rills,</line>
      <line>The melodies of birds and bees,</line>
      <line>The murmuring of summer-seas,</line>
      <line>And pattering rain, and breathing dew,</line>
      <line>And airs of evening.</line>
      <line>And it knew</line>
      <line> That seldom-heard mysterious sound,</line>
      <line>Which, driven, on its diurnal round</line>
      <line>As it floats through boundless day,</line>
      <line>Our world enkindles on its way –</line>
      <line>All this it knows, but will not tell</line>
      <line>To those who cannot question well</line>
      <line>The spirit that inhabits it.</line>
      <line>It talks according to the wit</line>
      <line>Of its companions, and no more</line>
      <line>Is heard than has been felt before</line>
      <line> By those who tempt it to betray</line>
      <line>These secrets of an elder day –</line>
      <line>But sweetly, as it answers, will</line>
      <line>Flatter hands of perfect skill:</line>
      <line>It keeps its highest holiest tone</line>
      <line>For our belovéd Jane alone!</line>

      <line>In silence and tears,</line>
      <line>Half broken-hearted,</line>
      <line>To sever for years,</line>
      <line> Pale grew thy cheek and cold,</line>
      <line>Colder thy kiss –</line>
      <line>Truly that hour foretold</line>
      <line>Sorrow to this!</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>The dew of the morning</line>
      <line>Sunk chill on my brow,</line>

      <line>Thy vows are all broken,</line>
      <line>And light is thy fame:</line>
      <line> I hear thy name spoken,</line>
      <line>And share in its shame.</line>

      <line>Long, long shall I rue thee,</line>
      <line>Too deeply to tell.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line> In secret we met –</line>
      <line>In silence I grieve</line>

      <line>Fare thee well! thus disunited,</line>
      <line>Torn from every nearer tie,</line>
      <line>Seared in heart – and lone – and blighted,</line>
      <line>More than this I scarce can die.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>When all around grew drear and dark,</line>
      <line>And reason half withheld her ray,</line>
      <line>And hope but shed a dying spark</line>
      <line>Which more misled my lonely way –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> In that deep midnight of the mind,</line>
      <line>And that internal strife of heart,</line>
      <line>When, dreading to be deemed too kind,</line>
      <line>The weak despair – the cold depart!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When Fortune changed, and Love fled far,</line>
      <line>And Hatred’s shafts flew thick and fast,</line>
      <line>Thou wert the solitary star</line>
      <line>Which rose and set not to the last.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, blest be thine unbroken light!</line>
      <line>That watched me as a seraph’s eye,</line>
      <line> And stood between me and the night,</line>
      <line>For ever shining sweetly nigh.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the cloud upon us came,</line>
      <line>Which strove to blacken o’er thy ray –</line>
      <line>Then purer spread its gentle flame,</line>
      <line>And dashed the darkness all away!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Still may thy spirit dwell on mine,</line>
      <line>And teach it what to brave or brook:</line>
      <line>There’s more in one soft word of thine</line>
      <line>Than in the world’s defied rebuke.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Thou stoodst as stands a lovely tree,</line>
      <line>That still unbroke, though gently bent,</line>
      <line>Still waves with fond fidelity</line>
      <line>Its boughs above a monument.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The winds might rend, the skies might pour,</line>
      <line>But there thou wert – and still wouldst be</line>
      <line>Devoted in the stormiest hour</line>
      <line>To shed thy weeping leaves o’er me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But thou and thine shall know no blight,</line>
      <line>Whatever fate on me may fall;</line>
      <line> For Heaven in sunshine will requite</line>
      <line>The kind – and thee the most of all!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then let the ties of baffled love</line>
      <line>Be broken – thine will never break!</line>
      <line>Thy heart can feel, but will not move;</line>
      <line>Thy soul, though soft, will never shake.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And these, when all was lost beside,</line>
      <line>Were found and still are fixed, in thee –</line>
      <line>And bearing still a breast so tried,</line>
      <line>Earth is no desert – e’en to me!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Though the day of my destiny’s over,</line>
      <line>And the star of my fate hath declined,</line>
      <line>Thy soft heart refused to discover</line>
      <line>The faults which so many could find;</line>
      <line> Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,</line>
      <line>It shrunk not to share it with me,</line>
      <line>And the love which my spirit hath painted</line>
      <line>It never hath found but in thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then when Nature around me is smiling,</line>
      <line>The last smile which answers to mine,</line>
      <line>I do not believe it beguiling,</line>
      <line>Because it reminds me of thine;</line>
      <line>And when winds are at war with the ocean,</line>
      <line>As the breasts I believed in with me,</line>
      <line> If their billows excite an emotion,</line>
      <line>It is that they bear me from thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,</line>
      <line>And its fragments are sunk in the wave,</line>
      <line>Though I feel that my soul is delivered</line>
      <line>To pain – it shall not be its slave!</line>
      <line>There is many a pang to pursue me</line>
      <line>(They may crush, but they shall not contemn),</line>
      <line>They may torture, but shall not subdue me –</line>
      <line>’Tis of thee that I think – not of them!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Though human, thou didst not deceive me,</line>
      <line>Though woman, thou didst not forsake,</line>
      <line>Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,</line>
      <line>Though slandered, thou never couldst shake;</line>
      <line>Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,</line>
      <line>Though parted, it was not to fly,</line>
      <line>Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me,</line>
      <line>Nor, mute, that the world might belie!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,</line>
      <line>Nor the war of the many with one;</line>
      <line> If my soul was not fitted to prize it,</line>
      <line>’Twas folly not sooner to shun –</line>
      <line>And if dearly that error hath cost me,</line>
      <line>And more than I once could foresee,</line>
      <line>I have found that, whatever it lost me,</line>
      <line>It could not deprive me of thee!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,</line>
      <line>Thus much I at least may recall,</line>
      <line>It hath taught me that what I most cherished</line>
      <line>Deserved to be dearest of all:</line>
      <line> In the desert a fountain is springing,</line>
      <line>In the wide waste there still is a tree,</line>
      <line>And a bird in the solitude singing,</line>
      <line>Which speaks to my spirit of thee!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>River, that rollest by the ancient walls</line>
      <line>Where dwells the lady of my love, when she</line>
      <line>Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls</line>
      <line>A faint and fleeting memory of me,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> What if thy deep and ample stream should be</line>
      <line>A mirror of my heart, where she may read</line>
      <line>The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,</line>
      <line>Wild as the wave, and headlong as thy speed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What do I say – a mirror of my heart?</line>
      <line>Are not thy waters sweeping, dark and strong?</line>
      <line>Such as my feelings were, and are, thou art –</line>
      <line>And such as thou art were my passions long.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Time may have somewhat tamed them – not for ever!</line>
      <line>Thou overflow’st thy banks, and not for aye</line>
      <line> Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!</line>
      <line>Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But left long wrecks behind – and now again,</line>
      <line>Borne in our old unchanged career, we move.</line>
      <line>Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,</line>
      <line>And I – to loving one I should not love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The current I behold will sweep beneath</line>
      <line>Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;</line>
      <line>Her eyes will look on thee when she shall breathe</line>
      <line>The twilight air, unharmed by summer’s heat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> She will look on thee – I have looked on thee,</line>
      <line>Full of that thought! And from that moment, ne’er</line>
      <line>Thy waters could I dream of, name, or see,</line>
      <line>Without the inseparable sigh for her.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream –</line>
      <line>Yes, they will meet the wave I gaze on now –</line>
      <line>Mine cannot witness, even in a dream,</line>
      <line>That happy wave repass me in its flow!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The wave that bears my tears returns no more –</line>
      <line>Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep?</line>
      <line> Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore:</line>
      <line>I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But that which keepeth us apart is not</line>
      <line>Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,</line>
      <line>But the distraction of a various lot –</line>
      <line>As various as the climates of our birth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A stranger loves the lady of the land,</line>
      <line>Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood</line>
      <line>Is all meridian, as if never fanned</line>
      <line>By that black wind that chills the polar flood.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> My blood is all meridian! Were it not,</line>
      <line>I had not left my clime, nor should I be,</line>
      <line>In spite of tortures ne’er to be forgot,</line>
      <line>A slave again of love – at least, of thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis vain to struggle – let me perish young –</line>
      <line>Live as I lived, and love as I have loved!</line>
      <line>To dust if I return, from dust I sprung –</line>
      <line>And then, at least my heart can ne’er be moved.</line>

    <title>I Watched Thee</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I watched thee when the foe was at our side,</line>
      <line>Ready to strike at him – or thee and me,</line>
      <line>Were safety hopeless, rather than divide</line>
      <line>Aught with one loved, save love and liberty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock</line>
      <line>Received our prow and all was storm and fear,</line>
      <line>And bade thee cling to me through every shock –</line>
      <line>This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,</line>
      <line>Yielding my couch – and stretched me on the ground</line>
      <line>When overworn with watching, ne’er to rise</line>
      <line>From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,</line>
      <line>And men and Nature reeled as if with wine –</line>
      <line> Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?</line>
      <line>For thee! Whose safety first provide for? Thine!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when convulsive throes denied my breath</line>
      <line>The faintest utterance to my fading thought,</line>
      <line>To thee – to thee – e’en in the gasp of death</line>
      <line>My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus much and more – and yet thou lovst me not,</line>
      <line>And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.</line>
      <line>Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot</line>
      <line>To strongly, wrongly, vainly, love thee still.</line>

      <line>Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast,</line>
      <line>Warm breath, light whisper, tender semitone,</line>
      <line>Bright eyes, accomplished shape, and languorous waist!</line>
      <line> Faded the flower and all its budding charms,</line>

      <line>Faded the shape of beauty from my arms,</line>

      <line>Vanished unseasonably at shut of eve,</line>
      <line>When the dusk holiday, or holinight,</line>
      <line>Of fragrant-curtained love begins to weave</line>
      <line>The woof of darkness thick for hid delight –</line>

      <line>He’ll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray.</line>

      <line>Withhold no atom’s atom, or I die–</line>

      <line>Physician Nature, let my spirit blood!</line>
      <line>Oh ease my heart of verse and let me rest –</line>
      <line>Throw me upon thy tripod till the flood</line>
      <line>Of stifling numbers ebbs from my full breast!</line>
      <line> A theme, a theme – great Nature, give a theme!</line>
      <line>Let me begin my dream:</line>
      <line>I come. I see thee, as thou standest there,</line>
      <line>Beckon me out into the wintry air.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah dearest love, sweet home of all my fears</line>
      <line>And hopes, and joys, and panting miseries,</line>
      <line>Tonight (if I may guess) thy beauty wears</line>
      <line>A smile of such delight,</line>
      <line>As brilliant and bright,</line>
      <line>As when, with ravished, aching, vassal eyes,</line>
      <line> Lost in soft amaze</line>

      <line>Who now, with greedy looks, eats up my feast?</line>

      <line>Ah, keep that hand unravished at the least</line>
      <line>Let, let, the amorous burn,</line>
      <line>But prithee do not turn</line>
      <line>The current of your heart from me so soon!</line>
      <line>Oh, save (in charity)</line>
      <line>The quickest pulse for me!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Save it for me, sweet love! Though music breathe</line>
      <line>Voluptuous visions into the warm air,</line>
      <line>Though swimming through the dance’s dangerous wreath,</line>
      <line>Be like an April day,</line>
      <line>Smiling and cold and gay –</line>
      <line>A temperate lily, temperate as fair,</line>

      <line>‘Why, this’, you’ll say, my Fanny, ‘is not true!’</line>
      <line>Put your soft hand upon your snowy side</line>
      <line> Where the heart beats – confess, ’tis nothing new!</line>
      <line>Must not a woman be</line>
      <line>A feather on the sea,</line>
      <line>Swayed to and fro by every wind and tide?</line>
      <line>Of as uncertain speed</line>
      <line>As blow-ball from the mead?</line>

      <line>I know it – and to know it is despair</line>

      <line>Whose heart goes fluttering for you everywhere,</line>
      <line>Nor, when away you roam,</line>
      <line> Dare keep its wretched home!</line>
      <line>Love, love alone, has pains severe and many –</line>
      <line>Then, loveliest, keep me free</line>
      <line>From torturing jealousy!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, if you prize my subdued soul above</line>
      <line>The poor, the fading, brief pride of an hour,</line>
      <line>Let none profane my Holy See of love,</line>
      <line>Or with a rude hand break</line>
      <line>The sacramental cake –</line>
      <line>Let none else touch the just new-budded flower!</line>
      <line> If not, may my eyes close,</line>
      <line>Love, on their last repose.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Unused to pattens or to clogs,</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mary, fate lent me a moment of pleasure</line>
      <line>Just to insure me in ages of pain –</line>
      <line>Just bid me meet thee and wish for the treasure</line>
      <line>To frown back and tell me I wisht it in vain!</line>
      <line> Just like spring sunshine I met with thee, Mary,</line>
      <line>That shines for a moment and cloudeth again;</line>
      <line>But, alas in our love there is one thing contrary</line>
      <line>Fate’s clouds of that moment cleared never again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mary, fond feelings will never forsake me –</line>
      <line>Never again though I’m happy with thee –</line>
      <line>Hope paints the cure that enraptured could make me</line>
      <line>Tho’ fate to torment, vows it never shall be!</line>
      <line>Mary, hope whispers some chance in our favour,</line>
      <line>That still I may gaze on thy beauties once more,</line>
      <line> But Fate’s bonds are on me, that cruel enslaver,</line>
      <line>And love is not lawful to meet as before.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mary how sweet when love basked in thy feature,</line>
      <line>Mary how saddened the sighs rose and fell;</line>
      <line>Surely those sighs was the instinct of Nature</line>
      <line>Of future forebodings Fate cared no to tell.</line>
      <line>Mary thy smiles still endear our departure,</line>
      <line>Though they do haunt me in gloomy deform;</line>
      <line>Like waining sunbeams the clouds follow after</line>
      <line>That just give a glance ere they’re lost in the storm.</line>

      <line>And is there sadness in thy dreams, my boy?</line>
      <line>What should the cloud be made of? Blesséd child!</line>
      <line>Thy spirit, borne upon a breeze of joy,</line>
      <line>All day hath ranged through sunshine, clear, yet mild –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And now thou tremblest! Wherefore? In thy soul</line>
      <line>There lies no past, no future – thou hast heard</line>
      <line>No sound of presage from the distance roll,</line>
      <line>Thy heart bears traces of no arrowy word!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>From thee no love hath gone – thy mind’s young eye</line>
      <line>Hath looked not into Death’s, and thence become</line>
      <line>A questioner of mute Eternity,</line>
      <line>A weary searcher for a viewless home.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor hath thy sense been quickened unto pain,</line>
      <line>By feverish watching for some step beloved;</line>
      <line> Free are thy thoughts, an ever-changeful train,</line>
      <line>Glancing like dewdrops, and as lightly moved!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet now, on billows of strange passion tossed,</line>
      <line>How art thou wildered in the Cave of Sleep!</line>
      <line>My gentle child, midst what dim phantoms lost,</line>
      <line>Thus in mysterious anguish dost thou weep?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Awake! They sadden me, those early tears,</line>
      <line>First flushings of the strong dark river’s flow,</line>
      <line>That must o’ersweep thy soul with coming years –</line>
      <line>The unfathomable flood of human woe!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Awful to watch, e’en rolling through a dream,</line>
      <line>Forcing wild spray-drops – but from childhood’s eyes!</line>
      <line>Wake, wake! as yet thy life’s transparent stream</line>
      <line>Should wear the tinge of none but summer skies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Come from the shadow of those realms unknown,</line>
      <line>Where now thy thoughts dismayed and darkling rove;</line>
      <line>Come to the kindly region all thine own,</line>
      <line>The home, still bright for thee with guardian love,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Happy, fair child, that yet a mother’s voice</line>
      <line>Can win thee back from visionary strife!</line>
      <line> Oh, shall my soul, thus wakened to rejoice,</line>
      <line>Start from the dreamlike wilderness of life?</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do you remember all the sunny places</line>
      <line>Where in bright days, long past, we played together?</line>
      <line>Do you remember all the old home faces</line>
      <line>That gathered round the hearth in wintry weather?</line>
      <line> Do you remember all the happy meetings,</line>
      <line>In summer evenings round the open door –</line>
      <line>Kind looks, kind hearts, kind words and tender greetings,</line>
      <line>And clasping hands whose pulses beat no more?</line>
      <line>Do you remember them?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do you remember all the merry laughter,</line>
      <line>The voices round the swing in our old garden,</line>
      <line>The dog that when we ran still followed after,</line>
      <line>The teasing frolic sure of speedy pardon?</line>
      <line>We were but children then, young happy creatures,</line>
      <line> And hardly knew how much we had to lose –</line>
      <line>But now the dreamlike memory of those features</line>
      <line>Comes back, and bids my darkened spirit muse:</line>
      <line>Do you remember them?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do you remember when we first departed</line>
      <line>From all the old companions who were round us –</line>
      <line>How very soon again we grew light-hearted,</line>
      <line>And talked with smiles of all the links which bound us?</line>
      <line>And after, when our footsteps were returning</line>
      <line>With unfelt weariness o’er hill and plain,</line>
      <line> How our young hearts kept boiling up, and burning,</line>
      <line>To think how soon we’d be at home again!</line>
      <line>Do you remember this?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do you remember how the dreams of glory</line>
      <line>Kept fading from us like a fairy treasure –</line>
      <line>How we thought less of being famed in story,</line>
      <line>And more of those to whom our fame gave pleasure?</line>
      <line>Do you remember, in far countries, weeping</line>
      <line>When a light breeze, a flower, hath brought to mind</line>
      <line>Old happy thoughts, which till that hour were sleeping,</line>
      <line> And made us yearn for those we left behind?</line>
      <line>Do you remember this?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do you remember when no sound woke gladly,</line>
      <line>But desolate echoes through our home were ringing,</line>
      <line>How for a while we talked – then paused full sadly,</line>
      <line>Because our voices bitter thoughts were bringing?</line>
      <line>Ah me, those days – those days! – my friend, my brother,</line>
      <line>Sit down and let us talk of all our woe,</line>
      <line>For we have nothing left but one another.</line>
      <line>Yet where they went, old playmate, we shall go –</line>
      <line> Let us remember this.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>When first thou camest, gentle, shy, and fond,</line>
      <line>My eldest-born, first hope, and dearest treasure,</line>
      <line>My heart received thee with a joy beyond</line>
      <line>All that it yet had felt of earthly pleasure –</line>
      <line> Nor thought that any love again might be</line>
      <line>So deep and strong as that I felt for thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Faithful and true, with sense beyond thy years</line>
      <line>And natural piety that leaned to Heaven;</line>
      <line>Wrung by a harsh word suddenly to tears,</line>
      <line>Yet patient of rebuke when justly given;</line>
      <line>Obedient, easy to be reconciled,</line>
      <line>And meekly-cheerful – such wert thou, my child!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not willing to be left – still by my side,</line>
      <line>Haunting my walks, while summer-day was dying –</line>
      <line> Nor leaving in thy turn; but pleased to glide</line>
      <line>Through the dark room where I was sadly lying,</line>
      <line>Or, by the couch of pain a sitter meek,</line>
      <line>Watch the dim eye, and kiss the feverish cheek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh boy, of such as thou are oftenest made</line>
      <line>Earth’s fragile idols: like a tender flower</line>
      <line>(No strength in all thy freshness) prone to fade,</line>
      <line>And bending weakly to the thunder-shower –</line>
      <line>Still, round the loved, thy heart found force to bind,</line>
      <line>And clung, like woodbine shaken in the wind!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Then thou, my merry love – bold in thy glee,</line>
      <line>Under the bough, or by the firelight dancing –</line>
      <line>With thy sweet temper, and thy spirit free,</line>
      <line>Didst come, as restless as a bird’s wing glancing,</line>
      <line>Full of a wild and irrepressible mirth,</line>
      <line>Like a young sunbeam to the gladdened earth!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thine was the shout! the song! the burst of joy!</line>
      <line>Which sweet from childhood’s rosy lip resoundeth;</line>
      <line>Thine was the eager spirit nought could cloy,</line>
      <line>And the glad heart from which all grief reboundeth;</line>
      <line> And many a mirthful jest and mock reply,</line>
      <line>Lurked in the laughter of thy dark-blue eye!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thine was many an art to win and bless,</line>
      <line>The cold and stern to joy and fondness warming;</line>
      <line>The coaxing smile – the frequent soft caress –</line>
      <line>The earnest tearful prayer all wrath disarming!</line>
      <line>Again my heart a new affection found,</line>
      <line>But thought that love with thee had reached its bound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length thou camest – thou, the last and least –</line>
      <line>Nick-named ‘The Emperor’ by thy laughing brothers</line>
      <line> Because a haughty spirit swelled thy breast,</line>
      <line>And thou didst seek to rule and sway the others,</line>
      <line>Mingling with every playful infant wile</line>
      <line>A mimic majesty that made us smile!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And oh, most like a regal child wert thou!</line>
      <line>An eye of resolute and successful scheming,</line>
      <line>Fair shoulders, curling lip, and dauntless brow –</line>
      <line>Fit for the world’s strife, not for Poet’s dreaming –</line>
      <line>And proud the lifting of thy stately head,</line>
      <line>And the firm bearing of thy conscious tread.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Different from both! Yet each succeeding claim,</line>
      <line>I, that all other love had been forswearing,</line>
      <line>Forthwith admitted equal and the same –</line>
      <line>Nor injured either, by this love’s comparing,</line>
      <line>Nor stole a fraction for the newer call,</line>
      <line>But in the Mother’s Heart, found room for all!</line>

      <line>Do you recall the fancies of many years ago,</line>
      <line>When the pulse danced those light measures that again it cannot know?</line>
      <line>Ah, we both of us are altered, and now we talk no more</line>
      <line>Of all the old creations that haunted us of yore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Then any favourite volume was a mine of long delight</line>
      <line>From whence we took our future to fashion as we might.</line>
      <line>We lived again its pages, we were its chiefs and kings,</line>
      <line>As actual, but more pleasant, than what the day now brings.</line>

      <line>It was an August evening, with sunset in the trees,</line>
      <line>When home you brought his Voyages who found the fair South Seas</line>
      <line>We read it till the sunset amid the boughs grew dim –</line>
      <line>All other favourite heroes were nothing beside him!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For weeks he was our idol, we sailed with him at sea,</line>
      <line>And the pond amid the willows the ocean seemed to be.</line>
      <line> The water-lilies growing beneath the morning smile,</line>
      <line>We called the South Sea islands, each flower a different isle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No golden lot that fortune could draw for human life,</line>
      <line>To us seemed like a sailor’s, amid the storm and strife.</line>
      <line>Our talk was of fair vessels that swept before the breeze,</line>
      <line>And new-discovered countries amid the Southern Seas.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Within that lonely garden what happy hours went by,</line>
      <line>While we fancied that around us spread foreign sea and sky!</line>
      <line>Ah, the dreaming and the distant no longer haunt the mind –</line>
      <line>We leave, in leaving childhood, life’s fairyland behind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> There is not of that garden a single tree or flower;</line>
      <line>They have ploughed its long green grasses, and cut down the lime-tree bower!</line>
      <line>Where are the guelder-roses whose silver used to bring,</line>
      <line>With the gold of the laburnums, their tribute to the Spring?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They have vanished with the childhood that with their treasures</line>
      <line>played;</line>
      <line>The life that cometh after dwells in a darker shade.</line>
      <line>Yet the name of that sea-captain it cannot but recall</line>
      <line>How much we loved his dangers, and how we mourned his fall!</line>

      <line>Another now (of curious mind) reveals</line>
      <line>What treasures in her bowels Earth conceals –</line>
      <line> Nature’s minuter works attract her eyes,</line>
      <line>Their laws, their powers, her deep research descries.</line>
      <line>From sense abstracted, some with arduous flight</line>
      <line>Explore the realms of intellectual light –</line>
      <line>With unremitting study seek to find</line>
      <line>How mind on matter, matter acts on mind.</line>
      <line>Alike in Nature, arts and manners, read,</line>
      <line>In every path of knowledge see them tread –</line>
      <line>Whilst men, convinced of female talents, pay</line>
      <line>To female worth the tributary lay!</line>

      <line>On Nature with impassioned look he gazed,</line>
      <line>Then through the cloud of adverse fortune burst</line>
      <line>Indignant, and in light unborrowed blazed!</line>

      <line>‘Five windows light the caverned man: through one he breathes the air;</line>
      <line>Through one, hears music of the spheres; through one, the eternal vine</line>
      <line>Flourishes, that he may receive the grapes; through one, can look</line>
      <line>And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth;</line>
      <line> Through one, himself pass out what time he please (but he will not,</line>
      <line>For stolen joys are sweet, and bread eaten in secret pleasant).’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So sang a fairy, mocking, as he sat on a streaked tulip</line>
      <line>Thinking none saw him. When he ceased I started from the trees</line>
      <line>And caught him in my hat, as boys knock down a butterfly.</line>
      <line>‘How know you this’, said I, ‘small sir? Where did you learn this song?’</line>
      <line>Seeing himself in my possession, thus he answered me:</line>
      <line>‘My master, I am yours! Command me, for I must obey.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Then tell me, what is the material world – and is it dead?’</line>
      <line>He laughing answered: ‘I will write a book on leaves of flowers,</line>
      <line> If you will feed me on love-thoughts, and give me now and then</line>
      <line>A cup of sparkling poetic fancies. So, when I am tipsy</line>
      <line>I’ll sing to you to this soft lute, and show you all alive</line>
      <line>The world, where every particle of dust breathes forth its joy.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I took him home in my warm bosom: as we went along</line>
      <line>Wild flowers I gathered, and he showed me each eternal flower.</line>
      <line>He laughed aloud to see them whimper because they were plucked –</line>
      <line>They hovered round me like a cloud of incense. When I came</line>
      <line>Into my parlour and sat down, and took my pen to write,</line>
      <line>My fairy sat upon the table, and dictated Europe.</line>

      <line> To cast off Bacon, Locke and Newton from Albion’s covering,</line>
      <line>To take off his filthy garments, and clothe him with imagination,</line>
      <line>To cast aside from poetry all that is not inspiration,</line>
      <line>That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of madness</line>
      <line>Cast on the inspired by the tame high finisher of paltry blots</line>
      <line>Indefinite, or paltry rhymes, or paltry harmonies,</line>
      <line>Who creeps into state government like a caterpillar to destroy –</line>
      <line>To cast off the idiot questioner, who is always questioning,</line>
      <line>But never capable of answering; who sits with a sly grin</line>
      <line>Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave;</line>
      <line>Who publishes doubt, and calls it knowledge; whose science is despair,</line>
      <line>Whose pretence to knowledge is envy, whose whole science is</line>
      <line>To destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous envy</line>
      <line>That rages round him like a wolf day and night without rest.</line>
      <line>He smiles with condescension, he talks of benevolence and virtue</line>
      <line>And those who act with benevolence and virtue they murder time on time!</line>
      <line>These are the destroyers of Jerusalem, these are the murderers</line>
      <line>Of Jesus, who deny the faith and mock at eternal life;</line>
      <line>Who pretend to poetry that they may destroy imagination</line>
      <line>By imitation of nature’s images drawn from remembrance!</line>
      <line> These are the sexual garments, the abomination of desolation</line>
      <line>Hiding the human lineaments as with an ark and curtains,</line>
      <line>Which Jesus rent – and now shall wholly purge away with fire,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>There is a party in the bower,</line>
      <line>Round the stone table in my garden:</line>
      <line>The squire is there, and, as I guess,</line>
      <line>His pretty little daughter Bess,</line>
      <line> With Harry the churchwarden.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>They were to come this very evening,</line>

      <line>To them I must relate the tale</line>
      <line> Of Peter Bell the Potter.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Off flew my pretty little barge</line>
      <line>All in a trance of indignation,</line>
      <line>And I, as well as I was able,</line>
      <line>On two poor legs to my stone table</line>
      <line>Limped on with some vexation.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh here he is!’ cried little Bess</line>

      <line>‘Sit down, I beg you would be seated’,</line>

      <line>Did I, to cover my confusion,</line>
      <line> Begin the promised tale.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, there is blessing in this gentle breeze,</line>
      <line>That blows from the green fields, and from the clouds,</line>
      <line>And from the sky; it beats against my cheek,</line>
      <line>And seems half-conscious of the joy it gives.</line>
      <line> Oh welcome messenger! Oh welcome friend!</line>
      <line>A captive greets thee, coming from a house</line>
      <line>Of bondage, from yon city’s walls set free,</line>
      <line>A prison where he hath been long immured.</line>
      <line>Now I am free, enfranchised and at large,</line>
      <line>May fix my habitation where I will.</line>
      <line>What dwelling shall receive me? In what vale</line>
      <line>Shall be my harbour? Underneath what grove</line>
      <line>Shall I take up my home, and what sweet stream</line>
      <line>Shall with its murmur lull me to my rest?</line>
      <line> The earth is all before me – with a heart</line>
      <line>Joyous, nor scared at its own liberty,</line>
      <line>I look about, and should the guide I choose</line>
      <line>Be nothing better than a wandering cloud</line>
      <line>I cannot miss my way. I breathe again;</line>
      <line>Trances of thought and mountings of the mind</line>
      <line>Come fast upon me. It is shaken off –</line>
      <line>As by miraculous gift ’tis shaken off –</line>
      <line>That burden of my own unnatural self,</line>
      <line>The heavy weight of many a weary day</line>
      <line> Not mine, and such as were not made for me.</line>
      <line>Long months of peace (if such bold word accord</line>
      <line>With any promises of human life),</line>
      <line>Long months of ease and undisturbed delight</line>
      <line>Are mine in prospect. Whither shall I turn,</line>
      <line>By road or pathway, or through open field,</line>
      <line>Or shall a twig, or any floating thing</line>
      <line>Upon the river, point me out my course?</line>
      <line>Enough that I am free, for months to come</line>
      <line>May dedicate myself to chosen tasks –</line>
      <line> May quit the tiresome sea and dwell on shore</line>
      <line>If not a settler on the soil, at least</line>
      <line>To drink wild waters, and to pluck green herbs,</line>
      <line>And gather fruits fresh from their native tree.</line>
      <line>Nay more – if I may trust myself, this hour</line>
      <line>Hath brought a gift that consecrates my joy;</line>
      <line>For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven</line>
      <line>Was blowing on my body, felt within</line>
      <line>A corresponding, mild, creative breeze,</line>
      <line>A vital breeze, which travelled gently on</line>
      <line> O’er things which it had made, and is become</line>
      <line>A tempest, a redundant energy,</line>
      <line>Vexing its own creation. ’Tis a power</line>
      <line>That does not come unrecognized, a storm</line>
      <line>Which, breaking up a long continued frost,</line>
      <line>Brings with it vernal promises, the hope</line>
      <line>Of active days, of dignity and thought,</line>
      <line>Of prowess in an honourable field,</line>
      <line>Pure passions, virtue, knowledge and delight,</line>
      <line>The holy life of music and of verse.</line>

    <title>‘A Dedicated Spirit’ (from 1805 Prelude IV)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In a throng,</line>
      <line>A festal company of maids and youths,</line>
      <line>Old men and matrons staid – promiscuous rout,</line>
      <line>A medley of all tempers – I had passed</line>
      <line>The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,</line>
      <line>With din of instruments and shuffling feet</line>
      <line>And glancing forms and tapers glittering</line>
      <line>And unaimed prattle flying up and down,</line>
      <line>Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there</line>
      <line> Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed</line>
      <line>That mounted up like joy into the head</line>
      <line>And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired</line>
      <line>The cock had crowed, the sky was bright with day;</line>
      <line>Two miles I had to walk along the fields</line>
      <line>Before I reached my home. Magnificent</line>
      <line>The morning was, a memorable pomp,</line>
      <line>More glorious than I ever had beheld.</line>
      <line>The sea was laughing at a distance; all</line>
      <line>The solid mountains were as bright as clouds,</line>
      <line> Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;</line>
      <line>And in the meadows and the lower grounds</line>
      <line>Was all the sweetness of a common dawn –</line>
      <line>Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds,</line>
      <line>And labourers going forth into the fields.</line>
      <line>Ah, need I say, dear friend, that to the brim</line>
      <line>My heart was full? I made no vows, but vows</line>
      <line>Were then made for me: bond unknown to me</line>
      <line>Was given that I should be, else sinning greatly,</line>
      <line>A dedicated spirit. On I walked</line>
      <line> In blessedness, which even yet remains.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile –</line>
      <line>Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee –</line>
      <line>I saw thee every day, and all the while</line>
      <line>Thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!</line>
      <line>So like, so very like, was day to day!</line>
      <line>Whene’er I looked, thy image still was there;</line>
      <line>It trembled, but it never passed away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How perfect was the calm! It seemed no sleep –</line>
      <line>No mood, which season takes away, or brings –</line>
      <line>I could have fancied that the mighty deep</line>
      <line>Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah! then, if mine had been the painter’s hand –</line>
      <line>To express what then I saw – and add the gleam,</line>
      <line> The light that never was on sea or land,</line>
      <line>The consecration, and the poet’s dream!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I would have planted thee, thou hoary pile,</line>
      <line>Amid a world how different from this,</line>
      <line>Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;</line>
      <line>On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house, a mine</line>
      <line>Of peaceful years; a chronicle of Heaven –</line>
      <line>Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine</line>
      <line>The very sweetest had to thee been given!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> A picture had it been of lasting ease,</line>
      <line>Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;</line>
      <line>No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,</line>
      <line>Or merely silent Nature’s breathing life.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such, in the fond delusion of my heart,</line>
      <line>Such picture would I at that time have made –</line>
      <line>And seen the soul of truth in every part,</line>
      <line>A faith, a trust, that could not be betrayed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So once it would have been – ’tis so no more!</line>
      <line>I have submitted to a new control:</line>
      <line> A power is gone, which nothing can restore;</line>
      <line>A deep distress hath humanized my soul.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not for a moment could I now behold</line>
      <line>A smiling sea, and be what I have been.</line>
      <line>The feeling of my loss will ne’er be old –</line>
      <line>This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, Beaumont, friend (who would have been the friend,</line>
      <line>If he had lived, of him whom I deplore),</line>
      <line>This work of thine I blame not, but commend –</line>
      <line>This sea in anger, and that dismal shore!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O ’tis a passionate work – yet wise and well!</line>
      <line>Well chosen is the spirit that is here:</line>
      <line>That hulk which labours in the deadly swell,</line>
      <line>This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And this huge castle, standing here sublime,</line>
      <line>I love to see the look with which it braves,</line>
      <line>Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,</line>
      <line>The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,</line>
      <line>Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind!</line>
      <line> Such happiness, wherever it be known,</line>
      <line>Is to be pitied; for ’tis surely blind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,</line>
      <line>And frequent sights of what is to be borne!</line>
      <line>Such sights, or worse, as are before me here –</line>
      <line>Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Midway the Hill of Science, after steep</line>
      <line>And rugged paths that tire the unpractised feet,</line>
      <line>A grove extends, in tangled mazes wrought,</line>
      <line>And filled with strange enchantment. Dubious shapes</line>
      <line> Flit through dim glades, and lure the eager foot</line>
      <line>Of youthful ardour to eternal chase.</line>
      <line>Dreams hang on every leaf; unearthly forms</line>
      <line>Glide through the gloom, and mystic visions swim</line>
      <line>Before the cheated sense. Athwart the mists,</line>
      <line>Far into vacant space, huge shadows stretch</line>
      <line>And seem realities; while things of life,</line>
      <line>Obvious to sight and touch, all glowing round,</line>
      <line>Fade to the hue of shadows.</line>
      <line>Scruples here,</line>
      <line>With filmy net, most like the autumnal webs</line>
      <line> Of floating gossamer, arrest the foot</line>
      <line>Of generous enterprise, and palsy Hope</line>
      <line>And fair Ambition with the chilling touch</line>
      <line>Of sickly hesitation and blank fear.</line>
      <line>Nor seldom Indolence these lawns among</line>
      <line>Fixes her turf-built seat, and wears the garb</line>
      <line>Of deep philosophy, and museful sits</line>
      <line>In dreamy twilight of the vacant mind,</line>
      <line>Soothed by the whispering shade – for soothing soft</line>
      <line>The shades, and vistas lengthening into air</line>
      <line> With moonbeam-rainbows tinted. Here each mind</line>
      <line>Of finer mould, acute and delicate,</line>
      <line>In its high progress to eternal truth</line>
      <line>Rests for a space in fairy bowers entranced,</line>
      <line>And loves the softened light and tender gloom,</line>
      <line>And (pampered with most insubstantial food)</line>
      <line>Looks down indignant on the grosser world</line>
      <line>And matter’s cumbrous shapings!</line>
      <line>Youth beloved</line>
      <line>Of Science, of the Muse beloved, not here –</line>
      <line>Not in the maze of metaphysic lore</line>
      <line> Build thou thy place of resting! Lightly tread</line>
      <line>The dangerous ground, on noble aims intent,</line>
      <line>And be this Circe of the studious cell</line>
      <line>Enjoyed but still subservient. Active scenes</line>
      <line>Shall soon with healthful spirit brace thy mind,</line>
      <line>And fair exertion (for bright fame sustained,</line>
      <line>For friends, for country) chase each spleen-fed fog</line>
      <line>That blots the wide Creation:</line>
      <line>Now Heaven conduct thee with a parent’s love!</line>

      <line>Sweet baby boy, accept a stranger’s song;</line>
      <line>An untaught minstrel joys to sing of thee!</line>
      <line>And, all alone, her forest haunts among,</line>
      <line>Courts the wild tone of mazy harmony!</line>
      <line>A stranger’s song, babe of the mountain-wild,</line>
      <line>Greets thee as Inspiration’s darling child!</line>
      <line>Oh may the fine-wrought spirit of thy sire</line>
      <line>Awake thy soul and breathe upon thy lyre!</line>
      <line> And blest, amid thy mountain haunts sublime,</line>
      <line>Be all thy days, thy rosy infant days,</line>
      <line>And may the never-tiring steps of time</line>
      <line>Press lightly on with thee o’er life’s disastrous maze.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ye hills, coeval with the birth of time!</line>
      <line>O Bleak summits, linked in chains of rosy light!</line>
      <line>Oh may your wonders many a year invite</line>
      <line>Your native son the breezy path to climb</line>
      <line>Where, in majestic pride of solitude,</line>
      <line>Silent and grand, the hermit thought shall trace,</line>
      <line> Far o’er the wild infinity of space,</line>
      <line>The sombre horrors of the waving wood;</line>
      <line>The misty glen; the river’s winding wave;</line>
      <line>The last deep blush of summer’s lingering day;</line>
      <line>The winter storm that, roaming unconfined,</line>
      <line>Sails on the broad wings of the impetuous wind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, whether on the breezy height</line>
      <line>Where Skiddaw greets the dawn of light,</line>
      <line>Ere the rude sons of labour homage pay</line>
      <line>To summer’s flaming eye or winter’s banner grey;</line>
      <line> Whether Lodore its silver torrent flings</line>
      <line>The mingling wonders of a thousand springs;</line>
      <line>Whether smooth Bassenthwaite, at eve’s still hour,</line>
      <line>Reflects the young moon’s crescent pale,</line>
      <line>Or meditation seeks her silent bower</line>
      <line>Amid the rocks of lonely Borrowdale –</line>
      <line>Still may thy name survive, sweet boy, till Time</line>
      <line>Shall bend to Keswick’s vale thy Skiddaw’s brow sublime!</line>

      <line>The mystic fountain, bubbling, panting,</line>
      <line>While gossamer its network weaves</line>
      <line>Adown the blue lawn slanting –</line>
      <line>I’ll mark thy ‘sunny dome’ and view</line>
      <line>Thy ‘caves of ice’, thy fields of dew,</line>
      <line> Thy ever-blooming mead, whose flower</line>
      <line>Waves to the cold breath of the moonlight hour!</line>
      <line>Or when the day-star, peering bright</line>
      <line>On the grey wing of parting night,</line>
      <line>With more than vegetating power</line>
      <line>Throbs, grateful to the burning hour,</line>
      <line>As summer’s whispered sighs unfold</line>
      <line>Her million million buds of gold,</line>
      <line>Then will I climb the breezy bounds</line>
      <line>Of thy new paradise, extended,</line>
      <line> And listen to the different sounds</line>
      <line>Of winds and foamy torrents blended!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Spirit divine, with thee I’ll trace</line>
      <line>Imagination’s boundless space!</line>
      <line>With thee, beneath thy ‘sunny dome’</line>
      <line>I’ll listen to the minstrel’s lay</line>
      <line>Hymning the gradual close of day,</line>
      <line>In ‘caves of ice’ enchanted roam,</line>
      <line>Where on the glittering entrance plays</line>
      <line>The moon’s beam with its silvery rays,</line>
      <line> Or when the glassy stream</line>
      <line>That through the deep dell flows</line>
      <line>Flashes the noon’s hot beam –</line>
      <line>The noon’s hot beam that midway shows</line>
      <line>Thy flaming temple, studded o’er</line>
      <line>With all Peruvia’s lustrous store!</line>
      <line>There will I trace the circling bounds</line>
      <line>Of thy new paradise, extended,</line>
      <line>And listen to the awful sounds</line>
      <line>Of winds and foamy torrents blended.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> And now I’ll pause to catch the moan</line>
      <line>Of distant breezes, cavern-pent;</line>
      <line>Now, ere the twilight tints are flown,</line>
      <line>Purpling the landscape far and wide</line>
      <line>On the dark promontory’s side</line>
      <line>I’ll gather wild-flowers dew-besprent</line>
      <line>And weave a crown for thee,</line>
      <line>Genius of Heaven-taught poesy!</line>
      <line>While, opening to my wondering eyes</line>
      <line>Thou bidst a new Creation rise,</line>
      <line> I’ll raptured trace the circling bounds</line>
      <line>Of thy rich paradise, extended,</line>
      <line>And listen to the varying sounds</line>
      <line>Of winds and foamy torrents blended.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now, with lofty tones inviting,</line>
      <line>Thy nymph, her dulcimer swift-smiting,</line>
      <line>Shall wake me in ecstatic measures,</line>
      <line>Far, far removed from mortal pleasures,</line>
      <line>In cadence rich, in cadence strong,</line>
      <line>Proving the wondrous witcheries of song!</line>
      <line> I hear her voice – thy ‘sunny dome’,</line>
      <line>Thy ‘caves of ice’, aloud repeat –</line>
      <line>Vibrations maddening, sweet,</line>
      <line>Calling the visionary wanderer home!</line>
      <line>She sings of thee, oh favoured child</line>
      <line>Of minstrelsy, sublimely wild –</line>
      <line>Of thee whose soul can feel the tone</line>
      <line>Which gives to airy dreams a magic all their own!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>With him there often walked in friendly wise,</line>
      <line>Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,</line>
      <line>A noticeable man with large dark eyes</line>
      <line>And a pale face, that seemed undoubtedly</line>
      <line>As if a blooming face it ought to be!</line>
      <line>Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear</line>
      <line>(A face divine of heaven-born idiocy);</line>
      <line>Profound his forehead was, though not severe –</line>
      <line> Yet some did think that he had little business here.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, God forfend – his was a lawful right!</line>
      <line>Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;</line>
      <line>His limbs would toss about him with delight</line>
      <line>Like branches when strong winds the trees annoy.</line>
      <line>He lacked not implement, device or toy,</line>
      <line>To cheat away the hours that silent were;</line>
      <line>He would have taught you how you might employ</line>
      <line>Yourself, and many did to him repair –</line>
      <line>And certés, not in vain – he had inventions rare!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Instruments had he, playthings for the ear</line>
      <line>(Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,</line>
      <line>These served to catch the wind as it came near);</line>
      <line>Glasses he had with many colours gay –</line>
      <line>Others that did all little things display:</line>
      <line>The beetle with his radiance manifold</line>
      <line>(A mailéd angel on a battle day!)</line>
      <line>And leaves and flowers, and herbage green and gold,</line>
      <line>And all the glorious sights which fairies do behold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He would entice that other man to hear</line>
      <line> His music, and to view his imagery;</line>
      <line>And sooth, these two did love each other dear –</line>
      <line>As far as love in such a place could be!</line>
      <line>There did they lie, from earthly labour free,</line>
      <line>Most happy livers as were ever seen!</line>
      <line>If but a bird, to keep them company,</line>
      <line>Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,</line>
      <line>As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden Queen!</line>

    <title>‘A Mind Debarred’ (from 18O5 Prelude VI)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>O'er paths and fields</line>
      <line>In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes</line>
      <line>Of eglantine and through the shady woods,</line>
      <line>And o’er the Border Beacon and the waste</line>
      <line>Of naked pools and common crags that lay</line>
      <line>Exposed on the bare fell, was scattered love,</line>
      <line> A spirit of pleasure and youth’s golden gleam.</line>
      <line>Oh friend, we had not seen thee at that time,</line>
      <line>And yet a power is on me and a strong</line>
      <line>Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there!</line>
      <line>Far art thou wandered now in search of health</line>
      <line>And milder breezes – melancholy lot –</line>
      <line>But thou art with us, with us in the past,</line>
      <line>The present, with us in the times to come.</line>
      <line>There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,</line>
      <line>No languor, no dejection, no dismay,</line>
      <line> No absence scarcely can there be, for those</line>
      <line>Who love as we do. Speed thee well! Divide</line>
      <line>Thy pleasure with us; thy returning strength,</line>
      <line>Receive it daily as a joy of ours;</line>
      <line>Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift</line>
      <line>Of gales Etesian or of loving thoughts.</line>
      <line>I too have been a wanderer – but alas,</line>
      <line>How different is the fate of different men</line>
      <line>Though twins almost in genius and in mind!</line>
      <line>Unknown unto each other (yea, and breathing</line>
      <line> As if in different elements) we were framed</line>
      <line>To bend at last to the same discipline,</line>
      <line>Predestined if two beings ever were</line>
      <line>To seek the same delights, and have one health,</line>
      <line>One happiness. Throughout this narrative,</line>
      <line>Else sooner ended, I have known full well</line>
      <line>For whom I thus record the birth and growth</line>
      <line>Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,</line>
      <line>And joyous loves that hallow innocent days</line>
      <line>Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,</line>
      <line> And groves I speak to thee, my friend – to thee</line>
      <line>Who, yet a liveried schoolboy in the depths</line>
      <line>Of the huge city, on the leaded roof</line>
      <line>Of that wide edifice, thy home and school,</line>
      <line>Wast used to lie and gaze upon the clouds</line>
      <line>Moving in heaven, or haply, tired of this,</line>
      <line>To shut thine eyes and by internal light</line>
      <line>See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,</line>
      <line>Far distant, thus beheld from year to year</line>
      <line>Of thy long exile.</line>
      <line>Nor could I forget</line>
      <line> In this late portion of my argument</line>
      <line>That scarcely had I finally resigned</line>
      <line>My rights among those academic bowers</line>
      <line>When thou wert thither guided. From the heart</line>
      <line>Of London, and from the cloisters there, thou camest,</line>
      <line>And didst sit down in temperance and peace,</line>
      <line>A rigorous student. What a stormy course</line>
      <line>Then followed! Oh, it is a pang that calls</line>
      <line>For utterance to think how small a change</line>
      <line>Of circumstances might to thee have spared</line>
      <line> A world of pain, ripened ten thousand hopes</line>
      <line>For ever withered.</line>
      <line>Through this retrospect</line>
      <line>Of my own college life I still have had</line>
      <line>Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place</line>
      <line>Present before my eyes, have played with times</line>
      <line>(I speak of private business of the thought)</line>
      <line>And accidents as children do with cards,</line>
      <line>Or as a man who when his house is built,</line>
      <line>A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still</line>
      <line>In impotence of mind by his fireside</line>
      <line>Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought</line>
      <line>Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,</line>
      <line>And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,</line>
      <line>Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse</line>
      <line>Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms</line>
      <line>Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out</line>
      <line>From things well-matched or ill, and words for things –</line>
      <line>The self-created sustenance of a mind</line>
      <line>Debarred from Nature’s living images,</line>
      <line>Compelled to be a life unto itself,</line>
      <line> And unrelentingly possessed by thirst</line>
      <line>Of greatness, love, and beauty.</line>
      <line>Not alone,</line>
      <line>Ah, surely not in singleness of heart,</line>
      <line>Should I have seen the light of evening fade</line>
      <line>Upon the silent Cam, if we had met</line>
      <line>Even at that early time. I needs must hope,</line>
      <line>Must feel, must trust, that my maturer age</line>
      <line>And temperature less willing to be moved,</line>
      <line>My calmer habits and more steady voice,</line>
      <line>Would with an influence benign have soothed</line>
      <line> Or chased away the airy wretchedness</line>
      <line>That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod,</line>
      <line>In watchful meditation thou hast trod,</line>
      <line>A march of glory, which does put to shame</line>
      <line>These vain regrets.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>There is a change, and I am poor!</line>
      <line>Your love hath been, nor long ago,</line>
      <line>A fountain at my fond heart’s door,</line>
      <line>Whose only business was to flow –</line>
      <line> And flow it did; not taking heed</line>
      <line>Of its own bounty, or my need.</line>

      <line>What happy moments did I count –</line>

      <line>Now, for that consecrated fount</line>
      <line>Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,</line>
      <line>What have I? Shall I dare to tell?</line>
      <line>A comfortless and hidden well.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>A well of love. It may be deep</line>
      <line>(I trust it is), and never dry –</line>
      <line> What matter, if the waters sleep</line>
      <line>In silence and obscurity?</line>
      <line>Such change, and at the very door</line>
      <line>Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.</line>

    <title>‘Dreams of Delight, Farewell’ (Psyche, concluding stanzas)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>With fond embrace she clasped her long lost son,</line>
      <line> And gracefully received his lovely bride:</line>
      <line>‘Psyche! thou hardly hast my favour won!’</line>
      <line>With roseate smile her Heavenly parent cried,</line>
      <line>‘Yet hence thy charms immortal, deified,</line>
      <line>With the young Joys, thy future offspring fair,</line>
      <line>Shall bloom for ever at thy lover’s side!</line>
      <line>All-ruling Jove’s high mandate I declare –</line>
      <line>Blest denizen of Heaven, arise its joys to share!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She ceased, and lo! a thousand voices, joined</line>
      <line>In sweetest chorus, Love’s high triumph sing;</line>
      <line> There, with the Graces and the Hours entwined,</line>
      <line>His fairy train their rosy garlands bring,</line>
      <line>Or round their mistress sport on halcyon wing;</line>
      <line>While she enraptured lives in his dear eye,</line>
      <line>And drinks immortal love from that pure spring</line>
      <line>Of never-failing full felicity,</line>
      <line>Bathed in ambrosial showers of bliss eternally!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dreams of delight, farewell – your charms no more</line>
      <line>Shall gild the hours of solitary gloom!</line>
      <line>The page remains, but can the page restore</line>
      <line> The vanished bowers which Fancy taught to bloom?</line>
      <line>Ah, no! her smiles no longer can illume</line>
      <line>The path my Psyche treads no more for me.</line>
      <line>Consigned to dark oblivion’s silent tomb,</line>
      <line>The visionary scenes no more I see,</line>
      <line>Fast from the fading lines the vivid colours flee!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh friend! Oh teacher! God’s great gift to me!</line>
      <line>Into my heart have I received that lay</line>
      <line>More than historic, that prophetic lay,</line>
      <line>Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright)</line>
      <line> Of the foundations and the building-up</line>
      <line>Of thy own spirit thou hast loved to tell</line>
      <line>What may be told, to the understanding mind</line>
      <line>Revealable – and what within the mind</line>
      <line>May rise enkindled.</line>
      <line>Theme hard as high!</line>
      <line>Of smiles spontaneous and mysterious fears:</line>
      <line>The firstborn they of Reason, and twin-birth.</line>
      <line>Of tides obedient to external force,</line>
      <line>And currents self-determined (as might seem),</line>
      <line>Or by interior power. Of moments awful,</line>
      <line> Now in thy hidden life, and now abroad</line>
      <line>Mid festive crowds (thy brows too garlanded,</line>
      <line>A brother of the feast). Of fancies fair,</line>
      <line>Hyblaean murmurs of poetic thought</line>
      <line>Industrious in its joy, by lilied streams</line>
      <line>Native or outland, lakes and famous hills.</line>
      <line>Of more than fancy: of the hope of man</line>
      <line>Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,</line>
      <line>Where France in all her towns lay vibrating,</line>
      <line>Even as a bark becalmed on sultry seas</line>
      <line> Beneath the voice from Heaven – the bursting crash</line>
      <line>Of Heaven’s immediate thunder, when no cloud</line>
      <line>Is visible, or shadow on the main</line>
      <line>(Ah, soon night rolled on night, and every cloud</line>
      <line>Opened its eye of fire; and Hope aloft</line>
      <line>Now fluttered, and now tossed, upon the storm</line>
      <line>Floating). Of Hope afflicted and struck down –</line>
      <line>Thence summoned homeward, homeward to thy heart,</line>
      <line>Oft from the watchtower of man’s absolute self</line>
      <line>(With light unwaning in her eyes) to look</line>
      <line> Far on, herself a glory to behold,</line>
      <line>The Angel of the Vision! Then – last strain! –</line>
      <line>Of Duty (chosen laws controlling choice),</line>
      <line>Virtue and Love! An Orphic tale indeed,</line>
      <line>A tale divine of high and passionate thoughts</line>
      <line>To their own music chanted.</line>
      <line>Ah great Bard,</line>
      <line>Ere yet that last swell dying awed the air,</line>
      <line>With steadfast ken I viewed thee in the choir</line>
      <line>Of ever-enduring men! The truly great</line>
      <line>Have all one age, and from one visible space</line>
      <line> Shed influence, for they – both power, and act –</line>
      <line>Are permanent, and time is not with them,</line>
      <line>Save as it worketh for them, they in it.</line>
      <line>Nor less a sacred roll than those of old</line>
      <line>(And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame</line>
      <line>Among the archives of mankind), thy work</line>
      <line>Makes audible a linkéd song of truth –</line>
      <line>Of truth profound, a sweet continuous song,</line>
      <line>Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!</line>
      <line>Dear shall it be to every human heart –</line>
      <line> To me how more than dearest – me, on whom</line>
      <line>Comfort from thee, and utterance of thy love,</line>
      <line>Came with such heights and depths of harmony,</line>
      <line>Such sense of wings uplifting, that the storm</line>
      <line>Scattered and whirled me, till my thoughts</line>
      <line>Became a bodily tumult, and thy faithful hopes</line>
      <line>(Thy hopes of me, my friend, by me unfelt)</line>
      <line>Were troublous to me, almost as a voice</line>
      <line>Familiar once, and more than musical,</line>
      <line>To one cast forth whose hope had seemed to die –</line>
      <line> A wanderer with a worn-out heart,</line>
      <line>Mid strangers pining with untended wounds.</line>
      <line>Oh friend, too well thou knowst of what sad years</line>
      <line>The long suppression had benumbed my soul,</line>
      <line>That even as life returns upon the drowned</line>
      <line>The unusual joy awoke a throng of pains:</line>
      <line>Keen pangs of love (awakening, as a babe,</line>
      <line>Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart),</line>
      <line>And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope,</line>
      <line>And hope that would not know itself from fear –</line>
      <line> Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,</line>
      <line>And genius given, and knowledge won in vain;</line>
      <line>And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,</line>
      <line>And all which patient toil had reared, and all,</line>
      <line>Commune with thee had opened out, but flowers</line>
      <line>Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier</line>
      <line>In the same coffin, for the self-same grave.</line>
      <line>That way no more! And ill beseems it me,</line>
      <line>Who came a welcomer, in herald’s guise</line>
      <line>Singing of glory and futurity,</line>
      <line> To wander back on such unhealthful roads</line>
      <line>Plucking the poisons of self-harm! And ill</line>
      <line>Such intertwine beseems triumphal wreathes</line>
      <line>Strewed before thy advancing! Thou too, friend!</line>
      <line>Oh injure not the memory of that hour</line>
      <line>Of thy communion with my nobler mind</line>
      <line>By pity or grief, already felt too long!</line>
      <line>Nor let my words import more blame than needs:</line>
      <line>The tumult rose, and ceased – for peace is nigh</line>
      <line>Where wisdom’s voice has found a listening heart.</line>
      <line> Amid the howl of more that wintry storms</line>
      <line>The halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours</line>
      <line>Already on the wing!</line>
      <line>Eve following eve</line>
      <line>(Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of home</line>
      <line>Becomes most sweet) – hours for their own sake hailed,</line>
      <line>And more desired, more precious, for thy song!</line>
      <line>In silence listening, like a devout child,</line>
      <line>My soul lay passive: by thy various strain</line>
      <line>Driven as in surges now, beneath the stars</line>
      <line>(With momentary stars of my own birth –</line>
      <line>Fair constellated foam – still darting off</line>
      <line>Into the darkness), now a tranquil sea</line>
      <line>Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon!</line>
      <line>And when, oh friend, my comforter, my guide,</line>
      <line>Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength,</line>
      <line>Thy long sustainéd lay finally closed,</line>
      <line>And thy deep voice had ceased (yet thou thyself</line>
      <line>Wert still before mine eyes, and round us both</line>
      <line>That happy vision of beloved faces –</line>
      <line>All whom I deepliest love, in one room, all),</line>
      <line> Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close,</line>
      <line>I sat, my being blended in one thought –</line>
      <line>Thought was it, or aspiration, or resolve? –</line>
      <line>Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound.</line>
      <line>And when I rose, I found myself in prayer.</line>

    <title>From English Bards and Scotch Reviewers</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Time was, ere yet in these degenerate days</line>
      <line>Ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise,</line>
      <line>When sense and wit, with poesy allied –</line>
      <line>No fabled graces – flourished side by side,</line>
      <line> From the same fount their inspiration drew,</line>
      <line>And, reared by taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.</line>
      <line>Then in this happy isle a Pope’s pure strain</line>
      <line>Sought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain –</line>
      <line>A polished nation’s praise aspired to claim,</line>
      <line>And raised the people’s, as the poet’s, fame.</line>
      <line>Like him great Dryden poured the tide of song,</line>
      <line>In stream less smooth indeed, yet doubly strong.</line>
      <line>Then Congreve’s scenes could cheer, or Otway’s melt –</line>
      <line>For nature then an English audience felt.</line>
      <line> But why these names, or greater still, retrace,</line>
      <line>When all to feebler bards resign their place?</line>
      <line>Yet to such times our lingering looks are cast,</line>
      <line>When taste and reason with those times are past.</line>
      <line>No, look around, and turn each trifling page,</line>
      <line>Survey the precious works that please the age!</line>
      <line>This truth at least let satire’s self allow,</line>
      <line>No dearth of bards can be complained of now:</line>
      <line>The loaded press beneath her labour groans,</line>
      <line>And printer’s devils shake their weary bones,</line>
      <line> While Southey’s epics cram the creaking shelves,</line>
      <line>And Little’s lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves!</line>
      <line>Behold in various throngs the scribbling crew,</line>
      <line>For notice eager, pass in long review:</line>
      <line>Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,</line>
      <line>And rhyme and blank maintain an equal race;</line>
      <line>Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode,</line>
      <line>And Tales of Terror jostle on the road.</line>
      <line>Immeasurable measures move along,</line>
      <line>For simpering Folly loves a varied song</line>
      <line> (To strange, mysterious Dullness still the friend),</line>
      <line>Admires the strain she cannot comprehend!</line>
      <line>Thus Lays of Minstrels – may they be the last! –</line>
      <line>On half-strung harps, whine mournful to the blast…</line>
      <line> With eagle-pinions soaring to the skies,</line>
      <line>Behold the ballad-monger Southey rise –</line>
      <line>To him let Camoëns, Milton, Tasso yield –</line>
      <line>Whose annual strains like armies take the field.</line>
      <line>First in the ranks let Joan of Arc advance,</line>
      <line>The scourge of England and the boast of France!</line>
      <line>Though burnt by wicked Bedford as a witch,</line>
      <line>Behold her statue placed in glory’s niche –</line>
      <line>Her fetters burst, and just released from prison,</line>
      <line>A virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.</line>
      <line> Next see tremendous Thalaba come on,</line>
      <line>Arabia’s monstrous, wild and wondrous son,</line>
      <line>Domdaniel’s dread destroyer, who o’erthrew</line>
      <line>More mad magicians than the world e’er knew.</line>
      <line>Immortal hero, all thy foes o’ercome,</line>
      <line>For ever reign – the rival of Tom Thumb!</line>
      <line>Since startled metre fled before thy face,</line>
      <line>Well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race,</line>
      <line>Well might triumphant genii bear thee hence,</line>
      <line>Illustrious conqueror of common sense!</line>
      <line>Now, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,</line>
      <line>Cacique in Mexico, and Prince in Wales;</line>
      <line>Tells us strange tales, as other travellers do,</line>
      <line>More old than Mandeville’s, and not so true!</line>
      <line>Oh Southey, Southey, cease thy varied song –</line>
      <line>A bard may chant too often and too long!</line>
      <line>As thou art strong in verse, in mercy spare –</line>
      <line>A fourth, alas, were more than we could bear!</line>
      <line>But if, in spite of all the world can say,</line>
      <line>Thou still will verseward plod thy weary way,</line>
      <line> If still in Berkeley-ballads most uncivil</line>
      <line>Thou wilt devote old women to the Devil</line>
      <line>(The babe unborn thy dread intent may rue),</line>
      <line>‘God help thee’, Southey, and thy readers too!</line>
      <line>Next comes the dull disciple of thy school,</line>
      <line>That mild apostate from poetic rule,</line>
      <line>The simple Wordsworth, framer of a lay</line>
      <line>As soft as evening in his favourite May,</line>
      <line>Who warns his friend ‘to shake off toil and trouble,</line>
      <line>And quit his books, for fear of growing double’;</line>
      <line> Who both by precept and example shows</line>
      <line>That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose,</line>
      <line>Convincing all (by demonstration plain)</line>
      <line>Poetic souls delight in prose insane,</line>
      <line>And Christmas-stories, tortured into rhyme,</line>
      <line>Contain the essence of the true sublime.</line>
      <line>Thus when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,</line>
      <line>The idiot mother of an ‘Idiot Boy’,</line>
      <line>A moon-struck silly lad who lost his way,</line>
      <line>And, like his bard, confounded night with day,</line>
      <line> So close on each pathetic part he dwells,</line>
      <line>And each adventure so sublimely tells,</line>
      <line>That all who view the ‘idiot in his glory’</line>
      <line>Conceive the bard the hero of the story!</line>
      <line>Shall gentle Coleridge pass unnoticed here,</line>
      <line>To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?</line>
      <line>Though themes of innocence amuse him best,</line>
      <line>Yet still obscurity’s a welcome guest.</line>
      <line>If inspiration should her aid refuse</line>
      <line>To him who takes a pixy for a muse,</line>
      <line> Yet none in lofty numbers can surpass</line>
      <line>The bard who soars to elegize and ass!</line>
      <line>How well the subject suits his noble mind –</line>
      <line>A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind.</line>

    <title>From Feast of the Poets</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>All on a sudden, there rose on the stairs</line>
      <line>A noise as of persons with singular airs,</line>
      <line>You’d have thought ’twas the Bishops or Judges a-coming,</line>
      <line>Or whole court of Aldermen hawing and humming,</line>
      <line>Or Abbot at least, with his ushers before,</line>
      <line>But ’twas only Bob Southey and two or three more.</line>
      <line>As soon as he saw him Apollo seemed pleased,</line>
      <line>But as he had settled it not to be teased</line>
      <line>By all the vain dreamers from bedroom and brook,</line>
      <line>He turned from the rest without even a look!</line>
      <line>For Coleridge had vexed him long since I suppose</line>
      <line> By his idling, and gabbling, and muddling in prose,</line>
      <line>And Wordsworth one day made his very hairs bristle</line>
      <line>By going and changing his harp for a whistle!</line>
      <line>These heroes however, long used to attack,</line>
      <line>Were not by contempt to be so driven back</line>
      <line>But followed the God up, and shifting their place</line>
      <line>Stood full in his presence and looked in his face –</line>
      <line>When one began spouting the cream of orations</line>
      <line>In praise of bombarding his friends and relations,</line>
      <line>And tother some lines he had made on a straw,</line>
      <line> Showing how he had found it and what it was for,</line>
      <line>And how, when ’twas balanced, it stood like a spell!</line>
      <line>And how, when ’twas balanced no longer, it fell!</line>
      <line>A wild thing of scorn he described it to be,</line>
      <line>But he said it was patient to Heaven’s decree –</line>
      <line>Then he gazed upon nothing, and looking forlorn,</line>
      <line>Dropped a natural tear for that wild thing of scorn!</line>
      <line>Apollo half laughed betwixt anger and mirth,</line>
      <line>‘And cried was there ever such trifling on Earth?</line>
      <line>It is not enough that this nonsense, I fear,</line>
      <line> Has hurt the fine head of my friend Robert here,</line>
      <line>But the very best promise bred up in this school</line>
      <line>Must show himself proudest in playing the fool.</line>
      <line>What – think ye a bard’s a mere gossip, who tells</line>
      <line>Of the everyday feelings of everyone else,</line>
      <line>And that poetry lies, not in something select,</line>
      <line>But in gathering the refuse that others reject.</line>
      <line>Must a ballad doled out by a spectacled nurse</line>
      <line>About Two-Shoes or Thumb be your model in verse,</line>
      <line>And your writings, instead of sound fancy and style,</line>
      <line> Look more like the morbid abstractions of bile?</line>
      <line>There is one of you here – ’twas of him that I spoke</line>
      <line>Who, instead of becoming a byeword and joke,</line>
      <line>Should have brought back our fine old pre-eminent way,</line>
      <line>And been the first man at my table today.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In my youth’s summer I did sing of one,</line>
      <line>The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;</line>
      <line>Again I seize the theme, then but begun,</line>
      <line>And bear it with me, as the rushing wind</line>
      <line>Bears the cloud onwards. In that tale I find</line>
      <line>The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears</line>
      <line> Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,</line>
      <line>O’er which all heavily the journeying years</line>
      <line>Plod the last sands of life – where not a flower appears.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Since my young days of passion – joy, or pain –</line>
      <line>Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,</line>
      <line>And both may jar. It may be that in vain</line>
      <line>I would essay as I have sung to sing;</line>
      <line>Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling.</line>
      <line>So that it wean me from the weary dream</line>
      <line>Of selfish grief or gladness – so it fling</line>
      <line> Forgetfulness around me – it shall seem</line>
      <line>To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He who, grown agéd in this world of woe,</line>
      <line>In deeds not years piercing the depths of life,</line>
      <line>So that no wonder waits him (nor below</line>
      <line>Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,</line>
      <line>Cut to his heart again with the keen knife</line>
      <line>Of silent, sharp endurance) – he can tell</line>
      <line>Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife</line>
      <line>With airy images, and shapes which dwell</line>
      <line> Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul’s haunted cell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis to create, and in creating live</line>
      <line>A being more intense, that we endow</line>
      <line>With form our fancy, gaining as we give</line>
      <line>The life we image – even as I do now!</line>
      <line>What am I? Nothing. But not so art thou,</line>
      <line>Soul of my thought, with whom I traverse earth,</line>
      <line>Invisible but gazing, as I glow</line>
      <line>Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,</line>
      <line>And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings’ dearth.</line>

      <line>Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know</line>

      <line>Childhood and youth, friendship and love’s first glow,</line>
      <line>Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.</line>
      <line> These common woes I feel. One loss is mine</line>
      <line>Which thou too feel’st, yet I alone deplore.</line>
      <line>Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine</line>
      <line>On some frail bark in winter’s midnight roar;</line>
      <line>Thou hast, like to a rock-built refuge, stood</line>
      <line>Above the blind and battling multitude;</line>
      <line>In honoured poverty thy voice did weave</line>
      <line>Songs consecrate to truth and liberty –</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh for ten years, that I may overwhelm</line>
      <line>Myself in poesy – so I may do the deed</line>
      <line>That my own soul has to itself decreed.</line>
      <line>Then will I pass the countries that I see</line>
      <line>In long perspective, and continually</line>
      <line>Taste their pure fountains. First the realm I’ll pass</line>
      <line>Of Flora, and old Pan: sleep in the grass,</line>
      <line>Feed upon apples red and strawberries,</line>
      <line>And choose each pleasure that my fancy sees –</line>
      <line>Catch the white-handed nymphs in shady places</line>
      <line>To woo sweet kisses from averted faces,</line>
      <line>Play with their fingers, touch their shoulders white</line>
      <line>Into a pretty shrinking with a bite</line>
      <line>As hard as lips can make it, till, agreed,</line>
      <line>A lovely tale of human life we’ll read.</line>
      <line>And one will teach a tame dove how it best</line>
      <line>May fan the cool air gently o’er my rest;</line>
      <line>Another, bending o’er her nimble tread,</line>
      <line>Will set a green robe floating round her head,</line>
      <line> And still will dance with ever varied ease,</line>
      <line>Smiling upon the flowers and the trees;</line>
      <line>Another will entice me on, and on</line>
      <line>Through almond blossoms and rich cinnamon,</line>
      <line>Till in the bosom of a leafy world</line>
      <line>We rest in silence, like two gems upcurled</line>
      <line>In the recesses of a pearly shell.</line>
      <line>And can I ever bid these joys farewell?</line>
      <line>Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,</line>
      <line>Where I may find the agonies, the strife</line>
      <line> Of human hearts – for lo, I see afar,</line>
      <line>O’ersailing the blue cragginess, a car</line>
      <line>And steeds with streamy manes. The charioteer</line>
      <line>Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear –</line>
      <line>And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly</line>
      <line>Along a huge cloud’s ridge; and now, with sprightly</line>
      <line>Wheel, downward come they into fresher skies,</line>
      <line>Tipt round with silver from the sun’s bright eyes.</line>
      <line>Still downward with capacious whirl they glide,</line>
      <line>And now I see them on a green hillside</line>
      <line> In breezy rest among the nodding stalks.</line>
      <line>The charioteer with wondrous gesture talks</line>
      <line>To the trees and mountains, and there soon appear</line>
      <line>Shapes of delight, of mystery, and fear,</line>
      <line>Passing along before a dusky space</line>
      <line>Made by some mighty oaks. As they would chase</line>
      <line>Some ever-fleeting music, on they sweep!</line>
      <line>Lo, how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep –</line>
      <line>Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;</line>
      <line>Some with their faces muffled to the ear</line>
      <line> Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,</line>
      <line>Go glad and smilingly athwart the gloom;</line>
      <line>Some looking back, and some with upward gaze.</line>
      <line>Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways</line>
      <line>Flit onward: now a lovely wreath of girls</line>
      <line>Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls –</line>
      <line>And now broad wings! Most awfully intent</line>
      <line>The driver of those steeds is forward bent,</line>
      <line>And seems to listen – oh that I might know</line>
      <line>All that he writes with such a hurrying glow!</line>
      <line> The visions all are fled – the car is fled</line>
      <line>Into the light of Heaven – and in their stead</line>
      <line>A sense of real things comes doubly strong,</line>
      <line>And, like a muddy stream, would bear along</line>
      <line>My soul to nothingness! But I will strive</line>
      <line>Against all doubtings, and will keep alive</line>
      <line>The thought of that same chariot, and the strange</line>
      <line>Journey it went.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave</line>
      <line>A paradise for a sect; the savage too</line>
      <line>From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep</line>
      <line>Guesses at Heaven – pity these have not</line>
      <line> Traced upon vellum or wild Indian leaf</line>
      <line>The shadows of melodious utterance!</line>
      <line>But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die –</line>
      <line>For poesy alone can tell her dreams –</line>
      <line>With the fine spell of words alone can save</line>
      <line>Imagination from the sable chain</line>
      <line>And dumb enchantment. Who alive can say</line>
      <line>‘Thou art no poet – mayst not tell thy dreams!’</line>
      <line>Since every man whose soul is not a clod</line>
      <line>Hath visions, and would speak, if he had loved,</line>
      <line> And been well nurtured in, his mother tongue.</line>
      <line>Whether the dream now purposed to rehearse</line>
      <line>Be poet’s or fanatic’s will be known</line>
      <line>When this warm scribe my hand is in the grave.</line>
      <line>Methought I stood where trees of every clime,</line>
      <line>Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech,</line>
      <line>With plantain and spice-blossoms, made a screen –</line>
      <line>In neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise</line>
      <line>Soft-showering in my ears), and (by the touch</line>
      <line>Of scent) not far from roses. Turning round</line>
      <line> I saw an arbour with a drooping roof</line>
      <line>Of trellis-vines, and bells, and larger blooms,</line>
      <line>Like floral censers, swinging light in air…</line>
      <line>Then to the west I looked, and saw far off</line>
      <line>An image, huge of feature as a cloud,</line>
      <line>At level of whose feet an altar slept,</line>
      <line>To be approached on either side by steps</line>
      <line>And marble balustrade, and patient travail</line>
      <line>To count with toil the innumerable degrees.</line>
      <line>Towards the altar sober-paced I went,</line>
      <line>Repressing haste as too unholy there,</line>
      <line> And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine</line>
      <line>One ministering – and there arose a flame.</line>
      <line>When in mid-May the sickening east wind</line>
      <line>Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain</line>
      <line>Melts out the frozen incense from all flowers,</line>
      <line>And fills the air with so much pleasant health</line>
      <line>That even the dying man forgets his shroud –</line>
      <line>Even so that lofty sacrificial fire,</line>
      <line>Sending forth Maian incense, spread around</line>
      <line>Forgetfulness of everything but bliss,</line>
      <line>And clouded all the altar with soft smoke</line>
      <line>From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard</line>
      <line>Language pronounced: ‘If thou canst not ascend</line>
      <line>These steps, die on that marble where thou art!</line>
      <line>Thy flesh, near cousin to the common dust,</line>
      <line>Will parch for lack of nutriment – thy bones</line>
      <line>Will wither in few years, and vanish so</line>
      <line>That not the quickest eye could find a grain</line>
      <line>Of what thou now art on that pavement cold.</line>
      <line>The sands of thy short life are spent this hour,</line>
      <line> And no hand in the universe can turn</line>
      <line>Thy hourglass if these gummed leaves be burnt</line>
      <line>Ere thou canst mount up these immortal steps.’</line>
      <line>I heard, I looked: two senses – both at once</line>
      <line>So fine, so subtle – felt the tyranny</line>
      <line>Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed.</line>
      <line>Prodigious seemed the toil! The leaves were yet</line>
      <line>Burning, when suddenly a palsied chill</line>
      <line>Struck from the pavéd level up my limbs,</line>
      <line>And was ascending quick to put cold grasp</line>
      <line> Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat –</line>
      <line>I shrieked, and the sharp anguish of my shriek</line>
      <line>Stung my own ears – I strove hard to escape</line>
      <line>The numbness, strove to gain the lowest step!</line>
      <line>Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace. The cold</line>
      <line>Grew stifling, suffocating at the heart,</line>
      <line>And when I clasped my hands I felt them not.</line>
      <line>One minute before death, my iced foot touched</line>
      <line>The lowest stair, and, as it touched, life seemed</line>
      <line>To pour in at the toes – I mounted up,</line>
      <line> As once fair angels on a ladder flew</line>
      <line>From the green turf to Heaven.</line>
      <line>‘Holy Power’,</line>
      <line>Cried I, approaching near the hornéd shrine,</line>
      <line>‘What am I that should so be saved from death?</line>
      <line>What am I that another death come not</line>
      <line>To choke my utterance sacrilegious here?’</line>
      <line>Then said the veiléd shadow: ‘Thou hast felt</line>
      <line>What ’tis to die and live again before</line>
      <line>Thy fated hour. That thou hadst power to do so</line>
      <line>Is thy own safety – thou hast dated on</line>
      <line> Thy doom.’ ‘High Prophetess’, said I, ‘purge off</line>
      <line>Benign, if so it please thee, my mind’s film.’</line>
      <line>‘None can usurp this height’, returned that shade,</line>
      <line>‘But those to whom the miseries of the world</line>
      <line>Are misery, and will not let them rest.</line>
      <line>All else who find a haven in the world</line>
      <line>Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,</line>
      <line>If by a chance into this fane they come,</line>
      <line>Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half!’</line>
      <line>‘Are there not thousands in the world’, said I,</line>
      <line> Encouraged by the sooth voice of the shade,</line>
      <line>‘Who love their fellows even to the death,</line>
      <line>Who feel the giant agony of the world,</line>
      <line>And more, like slaves to poor humanity</line>
      <line>Labour for mortal good? I sure should see</line>
      <line>Other men here – but I am here alone.’</line>
      <line>‘Those whom thou spakest of are no visionaries’,</line>
      <line>Rejoined that voice, ‘they are no dreamers weak,</line>
      <line>They seek no wonder but the human face,</line>
      <line>No music but a happy-noted voice!</line>
      <line> They come not here, they have no thought to come –</line>
      <line>And thou art here, for thou art less than they.</line>
      <line>What benefit canst thou do, or all thy tribe,</line>
      <line>To the great world? Thou art a dreaming thing,</line>
      <line>A fever of thyself! Think of the earth –</line>
      <line>What bliss even in hope is there for thee?</line>
      <line>What haven? Every creature hath its home,</line>
      <line>Every sole man hath days of joy and pain,</line>
      <line>Whether his labours be sublime or low:</line>
      <line>The pain alone, the joy alone – distinct.</line>
      <line> Only the dreamer venoms all his days,</line>
      <line>Bearing more woe than all his sins deserve.</line>
      <line>Therefore – that happiness be somewhat shared –</line>
      <line>Such things as thou art are admitted oft</line>
      <line>Into like gardens thou didst pass erewhile,</line>
      <line>And suffered in these temples! For that cause</line>
      <line>Thou standest safe beneath this statue’s knees.’</line>
      <line>‘That I am favoured for unworthiness</line>
      <line>By such propitious parley, medicined</line>
      <line>In sickness not ignoble, I rejoice –</line>
      <line> Aye, and could weep for love of such award.’</line>
      <line>So answered I, continuing, ‘If it please,</line>
      <line>Majestic shadow, tell me: sure not all</line>
      <line>Those melodies sung into the world’s ear</line>
      <line>Are useless – sure a poet is a sage,</line>
      <line>A humanist, physician to all men?</line>
      <line>That I am none I feel – as vultures feel</line>
      <line>They are no birds when eagles are abroad.</line>
      <line>What am I then? Thou spakest of my tribe –</line>
      <line>What tribe?’</line>
      <line>The tall shade veiled in drooping white</line>
      <line> Then spake, so much more earnest that the breath</line>
      <line>Moved the thin linen folds that drooping hung</line>
      <line>About a golden censer from the hand</line>
      <line>Pendent: ‘Art thou not of the dreamer tribe?</line>
      <line>The poet and the dreamer are distinct,</line>
      <line>Diverse, sheer opposite, antipodes!</line>
      <line>The one pours out a balm upon the world,</line>
      <line>The other vexes it.’ Then shouted I,</line>
      <line>Spite of myself, and with a Pythia’s spleen:</line>
      <line>‘Apollo! Faded, far-flown Apollo!</line>
      <line>Where is thy misty pestilence to creep</line>
      <line>Into the dwellings, through the door crannies</line>
      <line>Of all mock lyrists, large self-worshippers</line>
      <line>And careless hectorers in proud bad verse.</line>
      <line>Though I breathe death with them it will be life</line>
      <line>To see them sprawl before me into graves!</line>
      <line>Majestic shadow, tell me where I am –</line>
      <line>Whose altar this? for whom this incense curls?</line>
      <line>What image this whose face I cannot see</line>
      <line>For the broad marble knees? and who thou art,</line>
      <line> Of accent feminine so courteous?’</line>
      <line>Then the tall shade, in drooping linens veiled,</line>
      <line>Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath</line>
      <line>Stirred the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung</line>
      <line>About a golden censer from her hand</line>
      <line>Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed</line>
      <line>Long-treasured tears. ‘This temple, sad and lone,</line>
      <line>Is all spared from the thunder of a war</line>
      <line>Foughten long since by giant hierarchy</line>
      <line>Against rebellion; this old image here,</line>
      <line> Whose carvéd features wrinkled as he fell,</line>
      <line>Is Saturn’s – I, Moneta, left supreme</line>
      <line>Sole priestess of his desolation.’</line>
      <line>I had no words to answer, for my tongue,</line>
      <line>Useless, could find about its rooféd home</line>
      <line>No syllable of a fit majesty</line>
      <line>To make rejoinder to Moneta’s mourn.</line>
      <line>There was a silence, while the altar’s blaze</line>
      <line>Was fainting for sweet food: I looked thereon,</line>
      <line>And on the pavéd floor, where nigh were piled</line>
      <line> Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps</line>
      <line>Of other crispéd spice-wood – then again</line>
      <line>I looked upon the altar, and its horns</line>
      <line>Whitened with ashes, and its languorous flame –</line>
      <line>And then upon the offerings again.</line>
      <line>And so by turns, till sad Moneta cried,</line>
      <line>‘The sacrifice is done! But not the less</line>
      <line>Will I be kind to thee for thy good will.</line>
      <line>My power, which to me is still a curse,</line>
      <line>Shall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes</line>
      <line> Still swooning vivid through my globéd brain,</line>
      <line>With an electral changing misery,</line>
      <line>Thou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold,</line>
      <line>Free from all pain – if wonder pain thee not!’</line>
      <line>As near as an immortal’s spheréd words</line>
      <line>Could to a mother’s soften, were these last:</line>
      <line>And yet I had a terror of her robes,</line>
      <line>And chiefly of the veils, that from her brow</line>
      <line>Hung pale, and curtained her in mysteries</line>
      <line>That made my heart too small to hold its blood.</line>
      <line> This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand</line>
      <line>Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face,</line>
      <line>Not pined by human sorrows, but bright-blanched</line>
      <line>By an immortal sickness which kills not</line>
      <line>(It works a constant change, which happy death</line>
      <line>Can put no end to). Deathwards progressing</line>
      <line>To no death was that visage! It had past</line>
      <line>The lily and the snow; and beyond these</line>
      <line>I must not think now, though I saw that face –</line>
      <line>But for her eyes I should have fled away!</line>
      <line> They held me back, with a benignant light</line>
      <line>Soft mitigated by divinest lids</line>
      <line>Half-closed, and visionless entire they seemed</line>
      <line>Of all external things. They saw me not,</line>
      <line>But in blank splendour beamed like the mild moon</line>
      <line>Who comforts those she sees not – who knows not</line>
      <line>What eyes are upward cast. As I had found</line>
      <line>A grain of gold upon a mountain’s side,</line>
      <line>And, twinged with avarice, strained out my eyes</line>
      <line>To search its sullen entrails rich with ore,</line>
      <line> So at the view of sad Moneta’s brow</line>
      <line>I asked to see what things the hollow brain</line>
      <line>Behind enwombed – what high tragedy</line>
      <line>In the dark secret chambers of her skull</line>
      <line>Was acting, that could give so dread a stress</line>
      <line>To her cold lips, and fill with such a light</line>
      <line>Her planetary eyes, and touch her voice</line>
      <line>With such a sorrow.</line>
      <line>‘Shade of Memory’,</line>
      <line>Cried I, with act adorant at her feet,</line>
      <line>‘By all the gloom hung round thy fallen house,</line>
      <line> By this last temple, by the golden age,</line>
      <line>By great Apollo, thy dear foster-child,</line>
      <line>And by thyself, forlorn divinity,</line>
      <line>The pale omega of a withered race,</line>
      <line>Let me behold, according as thou saidst,</line>
      <line>What in thy brain so ferments to and fro!’</line>
      <line>No sooner had this conjuration passed</line>
      <line>My devout lips, than side by side we stood</line>
      <line>(Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine)</line>
      <line>Deep in the shady sadness of a vale.</line>

    <title>From Julian and Maddalo: A Conversation</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I rode one evening with Count Maddalo</line>
      <line>Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow</line>
      <line>Of Adria towards Venice – a bare strand</line>
      <line>Of hillocks, heaped from ever-shifting sand,</line>
      <line> Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds</line>
      <line>Such as from earth’s embrace the salt ooze breeds,</line>
      <line>Is this – an uninhabitable sea-side</line>
      <line>Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,</line>
      <line>Abandons; and no other objects breaks</line>
      <line>The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes</line>
      <line>Broken and unrepaired, and the tide makes</line>
      <line>A narrow space of level sand thereon,</line>
      <line>Where ’twas our wont to ride while day went down.</line>
      <line>This ride was my delight.</line>
      <line>I love all waste</line>
      <line> And solitary places, where we taste</line>
      <line>The pleasure of believing what we see</line>
      <line>Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be –</line>
      <line>And such was this wide ocean, and this shore</line>
      <line>More barren than its billows – and yet more</line>
      <line>Than all, with a remembered friend I love</line>
      <line>To ride as then I rode. For the wind drove</line>
      <line>The living spray along the sunny air</line>
      <line>Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,</line>
      <line>Stripped to their depths by the awakening north;</line>
      <line> And from the waves sound, like delight, broke forth,</line>
      <line>Harmonizing with solitude, and sent</line>
      <line>Into our hearts aërial merriment!</line>
      <line>So, as we rode, we talked, and the swift thought,</line>
      <line>Winging itself with laughter, lingered not,</line>
      <line>But flew from brain the brain (such glee was ours)</line>
      <line>Charged with light memories of remembered hours,</line>
      <line>None slow enough for sadness – till we came</line>
      <line>Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.</line>
      <line>This day had been cheerful, but cold, and now</line>
      <line> The sun was sinking, and the wind also.</line>
      <line>Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be</line>
      <line>Talk interrupted with such raillery</line>
      <line>That mocks itself because it cannot scorn</line>
      <line>The thoughts it would extinguish – ’twas forlorn</line>
      <line>But pleasing, such as once (so poets tell)</line>
      <line>The devils held within the dales of Hell</line>
      <line>Concerning God, free-will, and destiny!</line>
      <line>Of all that Earth has been, or yet may be,</line>
      <line>All that vain men imagine or believe,</line>
      <line> Or hope can paint, or suffering may achieve,</line>
      <line>We descanted, and I (for ever, still,</line>
      <line>Is it not wise to make the best of ill?) –</line>
      <line>Argued against despondency, but pride</line>
      <line>Made my companion take the darker side.</line>
      <line>The sense that he was greater than his kind</line>
      <line>Had struck, methinks, his eagle-spirit blind</line>
      <line>By gazing on its own exceeding light.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight,</line>
      <line>Over the horizon of the mountains. Oh</line>
      <line> How beautiful is sunset, when the glow</line>
      <line>Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,</line>
      <line>Thou paradise of exiles, Italy –</line>
      <line>Thy mountains, seas and vineyards, and the towers</line>
      <line>Of cities they encircle! It was ours</line>
      <line>To stand on thee beholding it; and then,</line>
      <line>Just where we had dismounted, the Count’s men</line>
      <line>Were waiting for us with the gondola.</line>
      <line>As those who pause on some delightful way</line>
      <line>Though bent on pilgrimage, we stood</line>
      <line> Looking upon the evening and the flood</line>
      <line>Which lay between the city and the shore,</line>
      <line>Paved with the image of the sky.</line>

    <title>From Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I weep for Adonais – he is dead!</line>
      <line>Oh weep for Adonais – though our tears</line>
      <line>Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!</line>
      <line>And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years</line>
      <line> To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,</line>
      <line>And teach them thine own sorrow, say: ‘With me</line>
      <line>Died Adonais; till the future dares</line>
      <line>Forget the past, his fate and fame shall be</line>
      <line>An echo and a light unto eternity!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay –</line>
      <line>When thy Son lay – pierced by the shaft which flies</line>
      <line>In darkness? Where was lorn Urania</line>
      <line>When Adonais died? With veiléd eyes,</line>
      <line>Mid listening Echoes, in her paradise</line>
      <line> She sat while one, with soft enamoured breath,</line>
      <line>Rekindled all the fading melodies</line>
      <line>With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,</line>
      <line>He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of death.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh weep for Adonais – he is dead!</line>
      <line>Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!</line>
      <line>Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed</line>
      <line>Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep</line>
      <line>Like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep;</line>
      <line>For he is gone, where all things wise and fair</line>
      <line> Descend; – oh dream not that the amorous deep</line>
      <line>Will yet restore him to the vital air:</line>
      <line>Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Most musical of mourners, weep again!</line>
      <line>Lament anew, Urania! He died,</line>
      <line>Who was the sire of an immortal strain,</line>
      <line>(Blind, old and lonely) when his country’s pride,</line>
      <line>The priest, the slave, and the liberticide,</line>
      <line>Trampled and mocked with many a loathéd rite</line>
      <line>Of lust and blood – he went, unterrified,</line>
      <line> Into the gulf of death – but his clear sprite</line>
      <line>Yet reigns o’er earth, the third among the sons of light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Most musical of mourners, weep anew!</line>
      <line>Not all to that bright station dared to climb –</line>
      <line>And happier they their happiness who knew,</line>
      <line>Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time</line>
      <line>In which suns perished; others more sublime,</line>
      <line>Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,</line>
      <line>Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;</line>
      <line>And some yet live, treading the thorny road,</line>
      <line> Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame’s serene abode.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But now thy youngest, dearest, one has perished –</line>
      <line>The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew</line>
      <line>Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,</line>
      <line>And fed with true-love tears instead of dew –</line>
      <line>Most musical of mourners, weep anew!</line>
      <line>Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last</line>
      <line>(The bloom whose petals, nipped before they blew,</line>
      <line>Died on the promise of the fruit) is waste!</line>
      <line>The broken lily lies – the storm is overpast.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> To that high capital, where kingly Death</line>
      <line>Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,</line>
      <line>He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,</line>
      <line>A grave among the eternal. Come away!</line>
      <line>Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day</line>
      <line>Is yet his fitting charnel-roof – while still</line>
      <line>He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay!</line>
      <line>Awake him not – surely he takes his fill</line>
      <line>Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He will awake no more, oh never more!</line>
      <line> Within the twilight chamber spreads apace</line>
      <line>The shadow of white Death, and at the door</line>
      <line>Invisible Corruption waits to trace</line>
      <line>His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;</line>
      <line>The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe</line>
      <line>Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface</line>
      <line>So fair a prey, till darkness, and the law</line>
      <line>Of mortal change, shall fill the grave which is her maw…</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Peace, peace! He is not dead, he doth not sleep –</line>
      <line>He hath awakened from the dream of life –</line>
      <line>’Tis we who, lost in stormy visions, keep</line>
      <line>With phantoms an unprofitable strife,</line>
      <line>And in mad trance strike with our spirit’s knife</line>
      <line>Invulnerable nothings. We decay</line>
      <line>Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief</line>
      <line>Convulse us and consume us day by day,</line>
      <line>And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He has outsoared the shadow of our night –</line>
      <line>Envy and calumny and hate and pain,</line>
      <line>And that unrest which men miscall delight,</line>
      <line> Can touch him not and torture not again.</line>
      <line>From the contagion of the world’s slow stain</line>
      <line>He is secure, and now can never mourn</line>
      <line>A heart grown cold, a head grown grey in vain;</line>
      <line>Nor, when the spirit’s self has ceased to burn,</line>
      <line>With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He lives, he wakes! ’Tis Death is dead, not he –</line>
      <line>Mourn not for Adonais. Thou young Dawn,</line>
      <line>Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee</line>
      <line>The spirit thou lamentest is not gone.</line>
      <line> Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!</line>
      <line>Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou air,</line>
      <line>Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown</line>
      <line>O’er the abandoned earth, now leave it bare</line>
      <line>Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!</line>

      <line> Break it not thou! Too surely shalt thou find</line>
      <line>Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,</line>
      <line>Of tears and gall. From the world’s bitter wind</line>

      <line>Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The breath whose might I have invoked in song</line>

      <line>Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng</line>
      <line>Whose sails were never to the tempest given.</line>
      <line>The massy earth and spheréd skies are riven!</line>
      <line>I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar,</line>
      <line>Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,</line>
      <line>The soul of Adonais like a star</line>
      <line> Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.</line>

      <line>Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,</line>

      <line>With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll!</line>

    <title>The Grave of a Poetess</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I stood beside thy lowly grave,</line>
      <line>Spring odours breathed around,</line>
      <line>And music in the river-wave</line>
      <line>Passed with a lulling sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> All happy things that love the sun</line>
      <line>In the bright air glanced by,</line>
      <line>And a glad murmur seemed to run</line>
      <line>Through the soft azure sky.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fresh leaves were on the ivy-bough</line>
      <line>That fringed the ruins near;</line>
      <line>Young voices were abroad, but thou</line>
      <line>Their sweetness couldst not hear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And mournful grew my heart for thee,</line>
      <line>Thou in whose woman’s mind</line>
      <line> The ray that brightens earth and sea,</line>
      <line>The light of song was shrined –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mournful that thou wert slumbering low</line>
      <line>With a dread curtain drawn</line>
      <line>Between thee and the golden glow</line>
      <line>Of this world’s vernal dawn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Parted from all the song and bloom</line>
      <line>Thou wouldst have loved so well,</line>
      <line>To thee the sunshine round thy tomb</line>
      <line>Was but a broken spell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> The bird, the insect on the wing,</line>
      <line>In their bright reckless play,</line>
      <line>Might feel the flush and life of spring,</line>
      <line>And thou wert past away!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But then, even then, a nobler thought</line>
      <line>O’er my vain sadness came,</line>
      <line>The immortal spirit woke, and wrought</line>
      <line>Within my thrilling frame.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Surely on lovelier things, I said,</line>
      <line>Thou must have looked ere now,</line>
      <line> Than all that round our pathway shed</line>
      <line>Odours and hues below.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The shadows of the tomb are here,</line>
      <line>Yet beautiful is Earth!</line>
      <line>What seest thou then where no dim fear,</line>
      <line>No haunting dream hath birth?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here a vain love to passing flowers</line>
      <line>Thou gavest, but where thou art</line>
      <line>The sway is not with changeful hours:</line>
      <line>There love and death must part.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Thou hast left sorrow in thy song,</line>
      <line>A voice not loud, but deep;</line>
      <line>The glorious bowers of Earth among,</line>
      <line>How often didst thou weep!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where couldst thou fix on mortal ground</line>
      <line>Thy tender thoughts and high?</line>
      <line>Now peace the woman’s heart hath found,</line>
      <line>And joy the poet’s eye.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>One dream of passion and of beauty more,</line>
      <line>And in its bright fulfilment let me pour</line>
      <line>My soul away! Let earth retain a trace</line>
      <line>Of that which lit my being, though its race</line>
      <line> Might have been loftier far. Yet one more dream –</line>
      <line>From my deep spirit one victorious gleam</line>
      <line>Ere I depart! For thee alone, for thee,</line>
      <line>May this last work, this farewell triumph be –</line>
      <line>Thou, loved so vainly! I would leave enshrined</line>
      <line>Something immortal of my heart and mind,</line>
      <line>That yet may speak to thee when I am gone,</line>
      <line>Shaking thine inmost bosom with a tone</line>
      <line>Of lost affection – something that may prove</line>
      <line>What she hath been, whose melancholy love</line>
      <line> On thee was lavished: silent pang and tear,</line>
      <line>And fervent song, that gushed when none were near,</line>
      <line>And dream by night, and weary thought by day,</line>
      <line>Stealing the brightness from her life away,</line>
      <line>While thou – awake! Not yet within me die</line>
      <line>Under the burden and the agony</line>
      <line>Of this vain tenderness, my spirit – wake!</line>
      <line>Even for thy sorrowful affection’s sake,</line>
      <line>Live. In thy work breathe out – that he may yet,</line>
      <line>Feeling sad mastery there, perchance regret</line>
      <line> Thine unrequited gift.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It comes – the power</line>
      <line>Within me born flows back – my fruitless dower</line>
      <line>That could not win me love! Yet once again</line>
      <line>I greet it proudly, with its rushing train</line>
      <line>Of glorious images: they throng, they press,</line>
      <line>A sudden joy lights up my loneliness –</line>
      <line>I shall not perish all!</line>
      <line>The bright work grows</line>
      <line>Beneath my hand, unfolding, as a rose,</line>
      <line>Leaf after leaf, to beauty. Line by line,</line>
      <line>I fix my thought, heart, soul, to burn, to shine,</line>
      <line> Through the pale marble’s veins. It grows – and now</line>
      <line>I give my own life’s history to thy brow,</line>
      <line>Forsaken Ariadne! Thou shalt wear</line>
      <line>My form, my lineaments; but oh, more fair,</line>
      <line>Touched into lovelier being by the glow</line>
      <line>Which in me dwells, as by the summer light</line>
      <line>All things are glorified. From thee my woe</line>
      <line>Shall yet look beautiful to meet his sight,</line>
      <line>When I am passed away. Thou art the mould</line>
      <line>Wherein I pour the fervent thoughts, the untold,</line>
      <line> The self-consuming! Speak to him of me,</line>
      <line>Thou, the deserted by the lonely sea,</line>
      <line>With the soft sadness of thine earnest eye –</line>
      <line>Speak to him, lorn one, deeply, mournfully,</line>
      <line>Of all my love and grief! Oh, could I throw</line>
      <line>Into thy frame a voice, a sweet, and low,</line>
      <line>And thrilling voice of song, when he came nigh,</line>
      <line>To send the passion of its melody</line>
      <line>Through his pierced bosom – on its tones to bear</line>
      <line>My life’s deep feeling, as the southern air</line>
      <line> Wafts the faint myrtle’s breath – to rise, to swell,</line>
      <line>To sink away in accents of farewell,</line>
      <line>Winning but one, one gush of tears, whose flow</line>
      <line>Surely my parted spirit yet might know,</line>
      <line>If love be strong as death!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now fair thou art,</line>
      <line>Thou form, whose life is of my burning heart</line>
      <line>Yet all the vision that within me wrought</line>
      <line>I cannot make thee! Oh, I might have given</line>
      <line>Birth to creations of far nobler thought;</line>
      <line>I might have kindled, with the fire of Heaven,</line>
      <line> Things not of such as die! But I have been</line>
      <line>Too much alone. A heart whereon to lean,</line>
      <line>With all these deep affections that o’erflow</line>
      <line>My aching soul and find no shore below;</line>
      <line>An eye to be my star; a voice to bring</line>
      <line>Hope o’er my path like sounds that breathe of spring –</line>
      <line>These are denied me, dreamt of still in vain!</line>
      <line>Therefore my brief aspirings from the chain</line>
      <line>Are ever but as some wild fitful song,</line>
      <line>Rising triumphantly, to die ere long</line>
      <line>In dirge-like echoes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Yet the world will see</line>
      <line>Little of this, my parting work, in thee.</line>
      <line>Thou shalt have fame! Oh, mockery! Give the reed</line>
      <line>From storms a shelter, give the drooping vine</line>
      <line>Something round which its tendrils may entwine,</line>
      <line>Give the parched flower a rain-drop, and the meed</line>
      <line>Of love’s kind words to woman! Worthless fame!</line>
      <line>That in his bosom wins not for my name</line>
      <line>The abiding place it asked! Yet how my heart,</line>
      <line>In its own fairy-world of song and art,</line>
      <line> Once beat for praise! Are those high longings o’er?</line>
      <line>That which I have been, can I be no more?</line>
      <line>Never, oh never more, though still thy sky</line>
      <line>Be blue as then, my glorious Italy!</line>
      <line>And though the music, whose rich breathings fill</line>
      <line>Thine air with soul, be wandering past me still;</line>
      <line>And though the mantle of thy sunlight streams</line>
      <line>Unchanged on forms instinct with poet-dreams,</line>
      <line>Never, oh never more! Where’er I move,</line>
      <line>The shadow of this broken-hearted love</line>
      <line> Is on me and around. Too well they know,</line>
      <line>Whose life is all within, too soon and well,</line>
      <line>When there the blight hath settled – but I go</line>
      <line>Under the silent wings of peace to dwell.</line>
      <line>From the slow-wasting, from the lonely pain,</line>
      <line>The inward burning of those words, ‘in vain’,</line>
      <line>Seared on the heart, I go. ’Twill soon be past,</line>
      <line>Sunshine, and song, and bright Italian heaven,</line>
      <line>And thou, oh thou, on whom my spirit cast</line>
      <line>Unvalued wealth – who knowst not what was given</line>
      <line>In that devotedness – the sad, and deep,</line>
      <line>And unrepaid! Farewell! If I could weep</line>
      <line>Once, only once, beloved one, on thy breast,</line>
      <line>Pouring my heart forth ere I sink to rest!</line>
      <line>But that were happiness, and unto me</line>
      <line>Earth’s gift is fame. Yet I was formed to be</line>
      <line>So richly blest! With thee to watch the sky,</line>
      <line>Speaking not, feeling but that thou wert nigh;</line>
      <line>With thee to listen, while the tones of song</line>
      <line>Swept even as part of our sweet air along –</line>
      <line> To listen silently! With thee to gaze</line>
      <line>On forms, the deified of olden days,</line>
      <line>This had been joy enough! And, hour by hour,</line>
      <line>From its glad well-springs drinking life and power,</line>
      <line>How had my spirit soared, and made its fame</line>
      <line>A glory for thy brow! Dreams, dreams – the fire</line>
      <line>Burns faint within me. Yet I leave my name</line>
      <line>(As a deep thrill may linger on the lyre</line>
      <line>When its full chords are hushed) awhile to live,</line>
      <line>And one day haply in thy heart revive</line>
      <line> Sad thoughts of me. I leave it with a sound,</line>
      <line>A spell o’er memory, mournfully profound –</line>
      <line>I leave it, on my country’s air to dwell!</line>
      <line>Say proudly yet, ‘’Twas hers who loved me well!’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Thine is a strain to read among the hills,</line>
      <line>The old and full of voices; by the source</line>
      <line>Of some free stream, whose gladdening presence fills</line>
      <line>The solitude with sound, for in its course</line>
      <line> Even such is thy deep song, that seems a part</line>
      <line>Of those high scenes, a fountain from their heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or its calm spirit fitly may be taken</line>
      <line>To the still breast in sunny garden-bowers,</line>
      <line>Where vernal winds each tree’s low tones awaken</line>
      <line>And bud and bell with changes mark the hours.</line>
      <line>There let thy thoughts be with me, while the day</line>
      <line>Sinks with a golden and serene decay;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or by some hearth where happy faces meet</line>
      <line>When night hath hushed the woods with all their birds,</line>
      <line> There (from some gentle voice) that lay were sweet</line>
      <line>As antique music linked with household-words,</line>
      <line>While in pleased murmurs woman’s lip might move</line>
      <line>And the raised eye of childhood shine in love;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or where the shadows of dark solemn yews</line>
      <line>Brood silently o’er some lone burial-ground</line>
      <line>Thy voice hath power that brightly might diffuse</line>
      <line>A breath, a kindling as of spring, around</line>
      <line>From its own glow of hope and courage high,</line>
      <line>And steadfast faith’s victorious constancy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> True bard, and holy, thou art even as one</line>
      <line>Who, by some secret gift of soul or eye,</line>
      <line>In every spot beneath the smiling sun</line>
      <line>Sees where the springs of living waters lie –</line>
      <line>Unseen they sleep, till, touched by thee,</line>
      <line>Bright healthful waves flow forth to each glad wanderer free.</line>

    <title>Extempore Effusion Upon the Death of James Hogg</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>When first, descending from the moorlands,</line>
      <line>I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide</line>
      <line>Along a bare and open valley,</line>
      <line>The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> When last along its banks I wandered,</line>
      <line>Through groves that had begun to shed</line>
      <line>Their golden leaves upon the pathways,</line>
      <line>My steps the Border Minstrel led.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,</line>
      <line>Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;</line>
      <line>And death upon the braes of Yarrow,</line>
      <line>Has closed the Shepherd-poet’s eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor has the rolling year twice measured,</line>
      <line>From sign to sign, its steadfast course,</line>
      <line> Since every mortal power of Coleridge</line>
      <line>Was frozen at its marvellous source –</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The rapt one, of the godlike forehead,</line>
      <line>The heaven-eyed creature, sleeps in earth:</line>
      <line>And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,</line>
      <line>Has vanished from his lonely hearth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,</line>
      <line>Or waves that own no curbing hand,</line>
      <line>How fast has brother followed brother,</line>
      <line>From sunshine to the sunless land!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber</line>
      <line>Were earlier raised, remain to hear</line>
      <line>A timid voice, that asks in whispers,</line>
      <line>‘Who next will drop and disappear?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,</line>
      <line>Like London with its own black wreath,</line>
      <line>On which with thee, oh Crabbe, forth-looking,</line>
      <line>I gazed from Hampstead’s breezy heath.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As if but yesterday departed,</line>
      <line>Thou too art gone before – but why,</line>
      <line> O’er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,</line>
      <line>Should frail survivors heave a sigh?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mourn rather for that holy spirit,</line>
      <line>Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep –</line>
      <line>For her who, ere her summer faded,</line>
      <line>Has sunk into a breathless sleep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No more of old romantic sorrows,</line>
      <line>For slaughtered youth or love-lorn maid!</line>
      <line>With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,</line>
      <line>And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead.</line>

      <line>Cling to those hopes which have no mortal birth.</line>
      <line> Thou art gone from us, and with thee departed</line>
      <line>How many lovely things have vanished too –</line>
      <line>Deep thoughts that, at thy will, to being started,</line>
      <line>And feelings teaching us our own were true!</line>
      <line>Thou hast been round us like a viewless spirit</line>
      <line>Known only by the music on the air:</line>
      <line>The leaf or flowers which thou hast named inherit</line>
      <line>A beauty known but from thy breathing there,</line>
      <line>For thou didst on them fling thy strong emotion –</line>
      <line>The likeness from itself the fond heart gave,</line>
      <line> As planets from afar look down on ocean</line>
      <line>And give their own sweet image to the wave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thou didst bring from foreign lands their treasures:</line>
      <line>As floats thy various melody along,</line>
      <line>We know the softness of Italian measures</line>
      <line>And the grave cadence of Castilian song.</line>
      <line>A general bond of union is the poet:</line>
      <line>By its immortal verse is language known,</line>
      <line>And for the sake of song do others know it –</line>
      <line>One glorious poet makes the world his own!</line>
      <line> And thou, how far thy gentle sway extended</line>
      <line>The heart’s sweet empire over land and sea:</line>
      <line>Many a stranger and far flower was blended</line>
      <line>In the soft wreath that glory bound for thee.</line>
      <line>The echoes of the Susquehanna’s waters</line>
      <line>Paused in the pinewoods words of thine to hear,</line>

      <line>Thy name was lovely and thy song was dear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Was not this purchased all too dearly? Never</line>

      <line> We see the goal, but know not the endeavour,</line>
      <line>Nor what fond hopes have on the way been lost.</line>
      <line>What do we know of the unquiet pillow</line>
      <line>By the worn cheek and tearful eyelid pressed,</line>
      <line>When thoughts chase thoughts like the tumultuous billow</line>
      <line>Whose very light and foam reveals unrest.</line>
      <line>We say the song is sorrowful, but know not</line>
      <line>What may have left that sorrow on the song:</line>
      <line>However mournful words may be, they show not</line>
      <line>The whole extent of wretchedness and wrong.</line>
      <line> They cannot paint the long sad hours past only</line>
      <line>In vain regrets o’er what we feel we are.</line>
      <line>Alas, the kingdom of the lute is lonely –</line>
      <line>Cold is the worship coming from afar!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet what is mind in woman but revealing</line>
      <line>In sweet clear light the hidden world below,</line>
      <line>By quicker fancies and a keener feeling</line>
      <line>Than those around, the cold and careless, know?</line>
      <line>What is to feel such feeling, but to culture</line>
      <line>A soil whence pain will never more depart –</line>
      <line> The fable of Prometheus and the vulture</line>
      <line>Reveals the poet’s and the woman’s heart!</line>
      <line>Unkindly are they judged, unkindly treated</line>
      <line>By careless tongues and by ungenerous words,</line>
      <line>While cruel sneer and hard reproach repeated</line>
      <line>Jar the fine music of the spirit’s chords.</line>
      <line>Wert thou not weary, thou whose soothing numbers</line>
      <line>Gave other lips the joy thine own had not?</line>
      <line>Didst thou not welcome thankfully the slumbers</line>
      <line>Which closed around thy mourning human lot?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line> What on this earth could answer thy requiring</line>
      <line>For earnest faith, for love (the deep and true),</line>
      <line>The beautiful, which was thy soul’s desiring</line>
      <line>But only from thyself its being drew!</line>
      <line>How is the warm and loving heart requited</line>
      <line>In this harsh world, where it awhile must dwell,</line>
      <line>Its best affections wronged, betrayed and slighted –</line>
      <line>Such is the doom of those who love too well.</line>
      <line>Better the weary dove should close its pinion,</line>
      <line>Fold up its golden wings and be at peace!</line>
      <line> Enter oh lady that serene dominion</line>
      <line>Where earthly cares and earthly sorrows cease.</line>
      <line>Fame’s troubled hour has cleared, and now, replying,</line>
      <line>A thousand hearts their music ask of thine:</line>
      <line>Sleep, with a light – the lovely and undying –</line>
      <line>Around thy grave! A grave which is a shrine.</line>

      <line>In the waves the stars of night,</line>
      <line>And those maidens started at you,</line>
      <line>Your limbs shone through so soft and bright.</line>
      <line>But no secrets dare we tell,</line>
      <line>For thy slaves unlace thee,</line>
      <line>And he, who shall embrace thee,</line>
      <line>Waits to try thy beauty’s spell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We have crowned thee queen of women,</line>
      <line>Since love’s love, the rose, hath kept her</line>
      <line>Court within thy lips and blushes,</line>
      <line>And thine eye, in beauty' swimming,</line>
      <line>Kissing, we rendered up the sceptre,</line>
      <line>At whose touch the startled soul</line>
      <line>Like an ocean bounds and gushes,</line>
      <line>And spirits bend at thy controul.</line>
      <line>But no secrets dare we tell,</line>
      <line>For thy slaves unlace thee,</line>
      <line>And he, who shall embrace thee,</line>
      <line>Is at hand, and so farewell.</line>

    <title>St Simeon Stylites</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>St Simeon Stylites</line>
      <line>Altho’ I be the basest of mankind,</line>
      <line>From scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin,</line>
      <line>Unfit for earth, unfit for heaven, scarce meet</line>
      <line>For troops of devils, mad with blasphemy,</line>
      <line>I will not cease to grasp the hope I hold</line>
      <line>Of saintdom, and to clamour, mourn and sob,</line>
      <line>Battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer,</line>
      <line>Have mercy, Lord, and take away my sin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let this avail, just, dreadful, mighty God,</line>
      <line>This not be all in vain, that thrice ten years,</line>
      <line>Thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs,</line>
      <line>In hungers and in thirsts, fevers and cold,</line>
      <line>In coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes and cramps,</line>
      <line>A sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud,</line>
      <line>Patient on this tall pillar I have borne</line>
      <line>Rain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow;</line>
      <line>And I had hoped that ere this period closed</line>
      <line>Thou wouldst have caught me up into thy rest,</line>
      <line>Denying not these weather-beaten limbs</line>
      <line>The meed of saints, the white robe and the palm.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O take the meaning, Lord: I do not breathe,</line>
      <line>Not whisper, any murmur of complaint.</line>
      <line>Pain heap’d ten-hundred-fold to this, were still</line>
      <line>Less burthen, by ten-hundred-fold, to bear,</line>
      <line>Than were those lead-like tons of sin that crush’d</line>
      <line>My spirit flat before thee.</line>
      <line>O Lord, Lord,</line>
      <line>Thou knowest I bore this better at the first,</line>
      <line>For I was strong and hale of body then;</line>
      <line>And tho’ my teeth, which now are dropt away,</line>
      <line>Would chatter with the cold, and all my beard</line>
      <line>Was tagg’d with icy fringes in the moon,</line>
      <line>I drown’d the whoopings of the owl with sound</line>
      <line>Of pious hymns and psalms, and sometimes saw</line>
      <line>An angel stand and watch me, as I sang.</line>
      <line>Now am I feeble grown; my end draws nigh;</line>
      <line>I hope my end draws nigh: half deaf I am,</line>
      <line>So that I scarce can hear the people hum</line>
      <line>About the column’s base, and almost blind,</line>
      <line>And scarce can recognise the fields I know;</line>
      <line>And both my thighs are rotted with the dew;</line>
      <line>Yet cease I not to clamour and to cry,</line>
      <line>While my stiff spine can hold my weary head,</line>
      <line>Till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone,</line>
      <line>Have mercy, mercy: take away my sin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O Jesus, if thou wilt not save my soul,</line>
      <line>Who may be saved? who is it may be saved?</line>
      <line>Who may be made a saint, if I fail here?</line>
      <line>Show me the man hath suffer’d more than I.</line>
      <line>For did not all thy martyrs die one death?</line>
      <line>For either they were stoned, or crucified,</line>
      <line>Or burn’d in fire, or boil’d in oil, or sawn</line>
      <line>In twain beneath the ribs; but I die here</line>
      <line>To-day, and whole years long, a life of death.</line>
      <line>Bear witness, if I could have found a way</line>
      <line>(And heedfully I sifted all my thought)</line>
      <line>More slowly-painful to subdue this home</line>
      <line>Of sin, my flesh, which I despise and hate,</line>
      <line>I had not stinted practice, O my God.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For not alone this pillar-punishment,</line>
      <line>Not this alone I bore: but while I lived</line>
      <line>In the white convent down the valley there,</line>
      <line>For many weeks about my loins I wore</line>
      <line>The rope that haled the buckets from the well,</line>
      <line>Twisted as tight as I could knot the noose;</line>
      <line>And spake not of it to a single soul,</line>
      <line>Until the ulcer, eating thro’ my skin,</line>
      <line>Betray’d my secret penance, so that all</line>
      <line>My brethren marvell’d greatly. More than this</line>
      <line>I bore, whereof, O God, thou knowest all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Three winters, that my soul might grow to thee,</line>
      <line>I lived up there on yonder mountain side.</line>
      <line>My right leg chain’d into the crag, I lay</line>
      <line>Pent in a roofless close of ragged stones;</line>
      <line>Inswathed sometimes in wandering mist, and twice</line>
      <line>Black’d with thy branding thunder, and sometimes</line>
      <line>Sucking the damps for drink, and eating not,</line>
      <line>Except the spare chance-gift of those that came</line>
      <line>To touch my body and be heal’d, and live:</line>
      <line>And they say then that I work’d miracles,</line>
      <line>Whereof my fame is loud amongst mankind,</line>
      <line>Cured lameness, palsies, cancers. Thou, O God,</line>
      <line>Knowest alone whether this was or no.</line>
      <line>Have mercy, mercy! cover all my sin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, that I might be more alone with thee,</line>
      <line>Three years I lived upon a pillar, high</line>
      <line>Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve;</line>
      <line>And twice three years I crouch’d on one that rose</line>
      <line>Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew</line>
      <line>Twice ten long weary weary years to this,</line>
      <line>That numbers forty cubits from the soil.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I think that I have borne as much as this—</line>
      <line>Or else I dream—and for so long a time,</line>
      <line>If I may measure time by yon slow light,</line>
      <line>And this high dial, which my sorrow crowns—</line>
      <line>So much—even so.</line>
      <line>And yet I know not well,</line>
      <line>For that the evil ones come here, and say,</line>
      <line>‘Fall down, O Simeon: thou hast suffer’d long</line>
      <line>For ages and for ages!’ then they prate</line>
      <line>Of penances I cannot have gone thro’,</line>
      <line>Perplexing me with lies; and oft I fall,</line>
      <line>Maybe for months, in such blind lethargies</line>
      <line>That Heaven, and Earth, and Time are choked.</line>
      <line>But yet</line>
      <line>Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints</line>
      <line>Enjoy themselves in heaven, and men on earth</line>
      <line>House in the shade of comfortable roofs,</line>
      <line>Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,</line>
      <line>And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,</line>
      <line>I, ’tween the spring and downfall of the light,</line>
      <line>Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,</line>
      <line>To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the saints;</line>
      <line>Or in the night, after a little sleep,</line>
      <line>I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet</line>
      <line>With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost.</line>
      <line>I wear an undress’d goatskin on my back;</line>
      <line>A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;</line>
      <line>And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,</line>
      <line>And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:</line>
      <line>O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;</line>
      <line>A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:</line>
      <line>’Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;</line>
      <line>Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,</line>
      <line>That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!</line>
      <line>They think that I am somewhat. What am I?</line>
      <line>The silly people take me for a saint,</line>
      <line>And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:</line>
      <line>And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)</line>
      <line>Have all in all endured as much, and more</line>
      <line>Than many just and holy men, whose names</line>
      <line>Are register’d and calendar’d for saints.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Good people, you do ill to kneel to me.</line>
      <line>What is it I can have done to merit this?</line>
      <line>I am a sinner viler than you all.</line>
      <line>It may be I have wrought some miracles,</line>
      <line>And cured some halt and maim’d; but what of that?</line>
      <line>It may be, no one, even among the saints,</line>
      <line>May match his pains with mine; but what of that?</line>
      <line>Yet do not rise; for you may look on me,</line>
      <line>And in your looking you may kneel to God.</line>
      <line>Speak! is there any of you halt or maim’d?</line>
      <line>I think you know I have some power with Heaven</line>
      <line>From my long penance: let him speak his wish.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, I can heal him. Power goes forth from me.</line>
      <line>They say that they are heal’d. Ah, hark! they shout</line>
      <line>‘St Simeon Stylites.’ Why, if so,</line>
      <line>God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,</line>
      <line>God reaps a harvest in thee. If this be,</line>
      <line>Can I work miracles and not be saved?</line>
      <line>This is not told of any. They were saints.</line>
      <line>It cannot be but that I shall be saved;</line>
      <line>Yea, crown’d a saint. They shout, ‘Behold a saint!’</line>
      <line>And lower voices saint me from above.</line>
      <line>Courage, St Simeon! This dull chrysalis</line>
      <line>Cracks into shining wings, and hope ere death</line>
      <line>Spreads more and more and more, that God hath now</line>
      <line>Sponged and made blank of crimeful record all</line>
      <line>My mortal archives.</line>
      <line>O my sons, my sons,</line>
      <line>I, Simeon of the pillar, by surname</line>
      <line>Stylites, among men; I, Simeon,</line>
      <line>The watcher on the column till the end;</line>
      <line>I, Simeon, whose brain the sunshine bakes;</line>
      <line>I, whose bald brows in silent hours become</line>
      <line>Unnaturally hoar with rime, do now</line>
      <line>From my high nest of penance here proclaim</line>
      <line>That Pontius and Iscariot by my side</line>
      <line>Show’d like fair seraphs. On the coals I lay,</line>
      <line>A vessel full of sin: all hell beneath</line>
      <line>Made me boil over. Devils pluck’d my sleeve,</line>
      <line>Abaddon and Asmodeus caught at me.</line>
      <line>I smote them with the cross; they swarm’d again.</line>
      <line>In bed like monstrous apes they crush’d my chest:</line>
      <line>They flapp’d my light out as I read: I saw</line>
      <line>Their faces grow between me and my book;</line>
      <line>With colt-like whinny and with hoggish whine</line>
      <line>They burst my prayer. Yet this way was left,</line>
      <line>And by this way I ’scaped them. Mortify</line>
      <line>Your flesh, like me, with scourges and with thorns;</line>
      <line>Smite, shrink not, spare not. If it may be, fast</line>
      <line>Whole Lents, and pray. I hardly, with slow steps,</line>
      <line>With slow, faint steps, and much exceeding pain,</line>
      <line>Have scrambled past those pits of fire, that still</line>
      <line>Sing in mine ears. But yield not me the praise:</line>
      <line>God only thro’ his bounty hath thought fit,</line>
      <line>Among the powers and princes of this world,</line>
      <line>To make me an example to mankind,</line>
      <line>Which few can reach to. Yet I do not say</line>
      <line>But that a time may come—yea, even now,</line>
      <line>Now, now, his footsteps smite the threshold stairs</line>
      <line>Of life—I say, that time is at the doors</line>
      <line>When you may worship me without reproach;</line>
      <line>For I will leave my relics in your land,</line>
      <line>And you may carve a shrine about my dust,</line>
      <line>And burn a fragrant lamp before my bones,</line>
      <line>When I am gather’d to the glorious saints.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While I spake then, a sting of shrewdest pain</line>
      <line>Ran shrivelling thro’ me, and a cloudlike change,</line>
      <line>In passing, with a grosser him made thick</line>
      <line>These heavy, horny eyes. The end! the end!</line>
      <line>Surely the end! What’s here? a shape, a shade,</line>
      <line>A flash of light. Is that the angel there</line>
      <line>That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come.</line>
      <line>I know thy glittering face. I waited long;</line>
      <line>My brows are ready. What! deny it now?</line>
      <line>Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it. Christ!</line>
      <line>’Tis gone: ’tis here again; the crown! the crown!</line>
      <line>So now ’tis fitted on and grows to me,</line>
      <line>And from it melt the dews of Paradise,</line>
      <line>Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense.</line>
      <line>Ah! let me not be fool’d, sweet saints: I trust</line>
      <line>That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Speak, if there be a priest, a man of God,</line>
      <line>Among you there, and let him presently</line>
      <line>Approach, and lean a ladder on the shaft,</line>
      <line>And climbing up into my airy home,</line>
      <line>Deliver me the blessed sacrament;</line>
      <line>For by the warning of the Holy Ghost,</line>
      <line>I prophesy that I shall die to-night,</line>
      <line>A quarter before twelve.</line>
      <line>But thou, O Lord,</line>
      <line>Aid all this foolish people; let them take</line>
      <line>Example, pattern: lead them to thy light.</line>

      <line>Thro’ scudding drifts the rainy Hyades</line>
      <line>Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;</line>
      <line>For always roaming with a hungry heart</line>
      <line>Much have I seen and known; cities of men</line>
      <line>And manners, climates, councils, governments,</line>
      <line>Myself not least, but honour’d of them all;</line>

      <line>This labour, by slow prudence to make mild</line>
      <line>A rugged people, and thro’ soft degrees</line>
      <line>Subdue them to the useful and the good.</line>

      <line>That ever with a frolic welcome took</line>
      <line>The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed</line>
      <line>Free hearts, free foreheads — you and I are old;</line>
      <line>Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;</line>
      <line>Death closes all: but something ere the end,</line>

      <line>The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:</line>

      <line>And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,</line>
      <line>A broken chancel with a broken cross,</line>
      <line>That stood on a dark strait of barren land.</line>
      <line>On one side lay the Ocean, and on one</line>
      <line>Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘The sequel of to-day unsolders all</line>
      <line>The goodliest fellowship of famous knights</line>
      <line>Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep</line>
      <line>They sleep—the men I loved. I think that we</line>
      <line>Shall never more, at any future time,</line>
      <line>Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,</line>
      <line>Walking about the gardens and the halls</line>
      <line>Of Camelot, as in the days that were.</line>
      <line>I perish by this people which I made,—</line>
      <line>Tho’ Merlin sware that I should come again</line>
      <line>To rule once more—but let what will be, be,</line>
      <line>I am so deeply smitten thro’ the helm</line>
      <line>That without help I cannot last till morn.</line>
      <line>Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,</line>
      <line>Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how</line>
      <line>In those old days, one summer noon, an arm</line>
      <line>Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,</line>
      <line>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</line>
      <line>Holding the sword—and how I row’d across</line>
      <line>And took it, and have worn it, like a king:</line>
      <line>And, wheresoever I am sung or told</line>
      <line>In aftertime, this also shall be known:</line>
      <line>But now delay not: take Excalibur,</line>
      <line>And fling him far into the middle mere:</line>
      <line>Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,</line>
      <line>Aidless, alone, and smitten thro’ the helm.</line>
      <line>A little thing may harm a wounded man.</line>
      <line>Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,</line>
      <line>Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So saying, from the ruin’d shrine he stept</line>
      <line>And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,</line>
      <line>Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,</line>
      <line>Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang</line>
      <line>Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down</line>
      <line>By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,</line>
      <line>Came on the shining levels of the lake.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,</line>
      <line>And o’er him, drawing it, the winter moon,</line>
      <line>Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth</line>
      <line>And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:</line>
      <line>For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,</line>
      <line>Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work</line>
      <line>Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long</line>
      <line>That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,</line>
      <line>This way and that dividing the swift mind,</line>
      <line>In act to throw: but at the last it seem’d</line>
      <line>Better to leave Excalibur conceal’d</line>
      <line>There in the many-knotted waterflags,</line>
      <line>That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.</line>
      <line>So strode he back slow to the wounded King.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘Hast thou perform’d my mission which I gave?</line>
      <line>What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,</line>
      <line>And the wild water lapping on the crag.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:</line>
      <line>‘Thou hast betray’d thy nature and thy name,</line>
      <line>Not rendering true answer, as beseem’d</line>
      <line>Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:</line>
      <line>For surer sign had follow’d, either hand,</line>
      <line>Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.</line>
      <line>This is a shameful thing for men to lie.</line>
      <line>Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again</line>
      <line>As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing</line>
      <line>I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time</line>
      <line>Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,</line>
      <line>Counting the dewy pebbles, fix’d in thought;</line>
      <line>But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,</line>
      <line>How curiously and strangely chased, he smote</line>
      <line>His palms together, and he cried aloud,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘And if indeed I cast the brand away,</line>
      <line>Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,</line>
      <line>Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,</line>
      <line>Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.</line>
      <line>What good should follow this, if this were done?</line>
      <line>What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,</line>
      <line>Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.</line>
      <line>Were it well to obey then, if a king demand</line>
      <line>An act unprofitable, against himself?</line>
      <line>The King is sick, and knows not what he does.</line>
      <line>What record, or what relic of my lord</line>
      <line>Should be to aftertime, but empty breath</line>
      <line>And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,</line>
      <line>Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,</line>
      <line>Some one might show it at a joust of arms,</line>
      <line>Saying, “King Arthur’s sword, Excalibur,</line>
      <line>Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.</line>
      <line>Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps</line>
      <line>Upon the hidden bases of the hills.”</line>
      <line>So might some old man speak in the aftertime</line>
      <line>To all the people, winning reverence.</line>
      <line>But now much honour and much fame were lost.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,</line>
      <line>And hid Excalibur the second time,</line>
      <line>And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:</line>
      <line>‘What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘I heard the water lapping on the crag,</line>
      <line>And the long ripple washing in the reeds.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:</line>
      <line>‘Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,</line>
      <line>Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!</line>
      <line>Authority forgets a dying king,</line>
      <line>Laid widow’d of the power in his eye</line>
      <line>That bow’d the will. I see thee what thou art,</line>
      <line>For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,</line>
      <line>In whom should meet the offices of all,</line>
      <line>Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;</line>
      <line>Either from lust of gold, or like a girl</line>
      <line>Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.</line>
      <line>Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,</line>
      <line>And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:</line>
      <line>But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,</line>
      <line>I will arise and slay thee with my hands.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,</line>
      <line>And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged</line>
      <line>Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch’d the sword,</line>
      <line>And strongly wheel’d and threw it. The great brand</line>
      <line>Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,</line>
      <line>And flashing round and round, and whirl’d in an arch,</line>
      <line>Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,</line>
      <line>Seen where the moving isles of winter shock</line>
      <line>By night, with noises of the northern sea.</line>
      <line>So flash’d and fell the brand Excalibur:</line>
      <line>But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm</line>
      <line>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</line>
      <line>And caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him</line>
      <line>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.</line>
      <line>And lightly went the other to the King.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:</line>
      <line>‘Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.</line>
      <line>Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</line>
      <line>‘Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems</line>
      <line>Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,</line>
      <line>Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,</line>
      <line>Not tho’ I live three lives of mortal men,</line>
      <line>So great a miracle as yonder hilt.</line>
      <line>Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;</line>
      <line>But when I look’d again, behold an arm,</line>
      <line>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</line>
      <line>That caught him by the hilt, and brandish’d him</line>
      <line>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:</line>
      <line>‘My end draws nigh; ’tis time that I were gone.</line>
      <line>Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,</line>
      <line>And bear me to the margin; yet I fear</line>
      <line>My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So saying, from the pavement he half rose,</line>
      <line>Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,</line>
      <line>And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</line>
      <line>As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere</line>
      <line>Remorsefully regarded thro’ his tears,</line>
      <line>And would have spoken, but he found not words,</line>
      <line>Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,</line>
      <line>O’er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,</line>
      <line>And rising bore him thro’ the place of tombs.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, as he walk’d, King Arthur panted hard,</line>
      <line>Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</line>
      <line>When all the house is mute. So sigh’d the King,</line>
      <line>Muttering and murmuring at his ear, ‘Quick, quick!</line>
      <line>I fear it is too late, and I shall die.’</line>
      <line>But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,</line>
      <line>Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk’d,</line>
      <line>Larger than human on the frozen hills.</line>
      <line>He heard the deep behind him, and a cry</line>
      <line>Before. His own thought drove him, like a goad.</line>
      <line>Dry clash’d his harness in the icy caves</line>
      <line>And barren chasms, and all to left and right</line>
      <line>The bare black cliff clang’d round him, as he based</line>
      <line>His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</line>
      <line>Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels—</line>
      <line>And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,</line>
      <line>And the long glories of the winter moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,</line>
      <line>Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,</line>
      <line>Beneath them; and descending they were ware</line>
      <line>That all the decks were dense with stately forms</line>
      <line>Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream — by these</line>
      <line>Three Queens with crowns of gold — and from them rose</line>
      <line>A cry that shiver’d to the tingling stars,</line>
      <line>And, as it were one voice, an agony</line>
      <line>Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills</line>
      <line>All night in a waste land, where no one comes,</line>
      <line>Or hath come, since the making of the world.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then murmur’d Arthur, ‘Place me in the barge,’</line>
      <line>And to the barge they came. There those three Queens</line>
      <line>Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.</line>
      <line>But she, that rose the tallest of them all</line>
      <line>And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,</line>
      <line>And loosed the shatter’d casque, and chafed his hands,</line>
      <line>And call’d him by his name, complaining loud,</line>
      <line>And dropping bitter tears against his brow</line>
      <line>Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white</line>
      <line>And colourless, and like the wither’d moon</line>
      <line>Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;</line>
      <line>And all his greaves and cuisses dash’d with drops</line>
      <line>Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls—</line>
      <line>That made his forehead like a rising sun</line>
      <line>High from the dais-throne — were parch’d with dust;</line>
      <line>Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,</line>
      <line>Mix’d with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.</line>
      <line>So like a shatter’d column lay the King;</line>
      <line>Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,</line>
      <line>From spur to plume a star of tournament,</line>
      <line>Shot thro’ the lists at Camelot, and charged</line>
      <line>Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,</line>
      <line>‘Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?</line>
      <line>Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?</line>
      <line>For now I see the true old times are dead,</line>
      <line>When every morning brought a noble chance,</line>
      <line>And every chance brought out a noble knight.</line>
      <line>Such times have been not since the light that led</line>
      <line>The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.</line>
      <line>But now the whole round table is dissolved</line>
      <line>Which was an image of the mighty world;</line>
      <line>And I, the last, go forth companionless,</line>
      <line>And the days darken round me, and the years,</line>
      <line>Among new men, strange faces, other minds.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:</line>
      <line>‘The old order changeth, yielding place to new,</line>
      <line>And God fulfils Himself in many ways,</line>
      <line>Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</line>
      <line>Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?</line>
      <line>I have lived my life, and that which I have done</line>
      <line>May He within Himself make pure! but thou,</line>
      <line>If thou shouldst never see my face again,</line>
      <line>Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer</line>
      <line>Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice</line>
      <line>Rise like a fountain for me night and day.</line>
      <line>For what are men better than sheep or goats</line>
      <line>That nourish a blind life within the brain,</line>
      <line>If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer</line>
      <line>Both for themselves and those who call them friend?</line>
      <line>For so the whole round earth is every way</line>
      <line>Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.</line>
      <line>But now farewell. I am going a long way</line>
      <line>With these thou seest—if indeed I go—</line>
      <line>(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)</line>
      <line>To the island-valley of Avilion;</line>
      <line>Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,</line>
      <line>Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies</line>
      <line>Deep-meadow’d, happy, fair with orchard-lawns</line>
      <line>And bowery hollows crown’d with summer sea,</line>
      <line>Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So said he, and the barge with oar and sail</line>
      <line>Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan</line>
      <line>That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,</line>
      <line>Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood</line>
      <line>With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere</line>
      <line>Revolving many memories, till the hull</line>
      <line>Look’d one black dot against the verge of dawn,</line>
      <line>And on the mere the wailing died away.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘The Bull, the Fleece are cramm’d, and not a room</line>
      <line>For love or money. Let us picnic there</line>
      <line>At Audley Court.’</line>
      <line>I spoke, while Audley feast</line>
      <line>Humm’d like a hive all round the narrow quay,</line>
      <line>To Francis, with a basket on his arm,</line>
      <line>To Francis just alighted from the boat,</line>
      <line>And breathing of the sea. ‘With all my heart,’</line>
      <line>Said Francis. Then we shoulder’d thro’ the swarm,</line>
      <line>And rounded by the stillness of the beach</line>
      <line>To where the bay runs up its latest horn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp’d</line>
      <line>The flat red granite; so by many a sweep</line>
      <line>Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach’d</line>
      <line>The griffin-guarded gates, and pass’d thro’ all</line>
      <line>The pillar’d dusk of sounding sycamores,</line>
      <line>And cross’d the garden to the gardener’s lodge,</line>
      <line>With all its casements bedded, and its walls</line>
      <line>And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid</line>
      <line>A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,</line>
      <line>Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,</line>
      <line>And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,</line>
      <line>Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,</line>
      <line>Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks</line>
      <line>Imbedded and injellied; last, with these,</line>
      <line>A flask of cider from his father’s vats,</line>
      <line>Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat</line>
      <line>And talk’d old matters over; who was dead,</line>
      <line>Who married, who was like to be, and how</line>
      <line>The races went, and who would rent the hall:</line>
      <line>Then touch’d upon the game, how scarce it was</line>
      <line>This season; glancing thence, discuss’d the farm,</line>
      <line>The four-held system, and the price of grain;</line>
      <line>And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,</line>
      <line>And came again together on the king</line>
      <line>With heated faces; till he laugh’d aloud;</line>
      <line>And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung</line>
      <line>To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oh! who would fight and march and countermarch,</line>
      <line>Be shot for sixpence in a battle-held,</line>
      <line>And shovell’d up into some bloody trench</line>
      <line>Where no one knows? but let me live my life.</line>
      <line>‘Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,</line>
      <line>Perch’d like a crow upon a three-legg’d stool,</line>
      <line>Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints</line>
      <line>Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.</line>
      <line>‘Who’d serve the state? for if I carved my name</line>
      <line>Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,</line>
      <line>I might as well have traced it in the sands;</line>
      <line>The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.</line>
      <line>‘Oh! who would love? I woo’d a woman once,</line>
      <line>But she was sharper than an eastern wind,</line>
      <line>And all my heart turn’d from her, as a thorn</line>
      <line>Turns from the sea; but let me live my life.’</line>

      <line>He sang his song, and I replied with mine:</line>
      <line>I found it in a volume, all of songs,</line>
      <line>Knock’d down to me, when old Sir Robert’s pride,</line>
      <line>His books—the more the pity, so I said—</line>
      <line>Came to the hammer here in March—and this—</line>
      <line>I set the words, and added names I knew.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep, and dream of me:</line>
      <line>Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister’s arm,</line>
      <line>And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.</line>
      <line>‘Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia’s arm;</line>
      <line>Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,</line>
      <line>For thou art fairer than all else that is.</line>
      <line>‘Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:</line>
      <line>Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:</line>
      <line>I go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.</line>
      <line>‘I go, but I return: I would I were</line>
      <line>The pilot of the darkness and the dream.</line>
      <line>Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me.’</line>

      <line>So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,</line>
      <line>The farmer’s son, who lived across the bay,</line>
      <line>My friend; and I, that having wherewithal,</line>
      <line>And in the fallow leisure of my life</line>
      <line>A rolling stone of here and everywhere,</line>
      <line>Did what I would; but ere the night we rose</line>
      <line>And saunter’d home beneath a moon, that, just</line>
      <line>In crescent, dimly rain’d about the leaf</line>
      <line>Twilights of airy silver, till we reach’d</line>
      <line>The limit of the hills; and as we sank</line>
      <line>From rock to rock upon the glooming quay,</line>
      <line>The town was hush’d beneath us: lower down</line>
      <line>The bay was oily calm; the harbour-buoy,</line>
      <line>Sole star of phosphorescence in the calm,</line>
      <line>With one green sparkle ever and anon</line>
      <line>Dipt by itself, and we were glad at heart.</line>

      <line>Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:</line>
      <line>What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)</line>
      <line>In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?</line>
      <line>But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease</line>
      <line>To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,</line>
      <line>To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;</line>
      <line>And come, for Love is of the valley, come,</line>
      <line>For Love is of the valley, come thou down</line>
      <line>And find him; by the happy threshold, he,</line>
      <line>Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,</line>
      <line>Or red with spirted purple of the vats,</line>
      <line>Of foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk</line>
      <line>With Death and Morning on the silver horns,</line>
      <line>Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,</line>
      <line>Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,</line>
      <line>That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls</line>
      <line>To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:</line>
      <line>But follow; let the torrent dance thee down</line>
      <line>To find him in the valley; let the wild</line>
      <line>Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave</line>
      <line>The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill</line>
      <line>Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,</line>
      <line>That like a broken purpose waste in air:</line>
      <line>So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales</line>
      <line>Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth</line>
      <line>Arise to thee; the children call, and I</line>
      <line>Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,</line>
      <line>Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;</line>
      <line>Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro’ the lawn,</line>
      <line>The moan of doves in immemorial elms,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>So word by word, and line by line,</line>
      <line>The dead man touch’d me from the past,</line>

      <line>The living soul was flash’d on mine,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And mine in this was wound, and whirl’d</line>
      <line>About empyreal heights of thought,</line>

      <line>The deep pulsations of the world,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Æonian music measuring out</line>
      <line>The steps of Time — the shocks of Chance—</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till now the doubtful dusk reveal’d</line>
      <line>The knolls once more where, couch’d at ease,</line>
      <line>The white kine glimmer’d, and the trees</line>
      <line>Laid their dark arms about the field:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And suck’d from out the distant gloom</line>
      <line>A breeze began to tremble o’er</line>
      <line>The large leaves of the sycamore,</line>
      <line>And fluctuate all the still perfume,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And gathering freshlier overhead,</line>
      <line>Rock’d the full-foliaged elms, and swung</line>
      <line>The heavy-folded rose, and flung</line>
      <line>The lilies to and fro, and said</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘The dawn, the dawn,’ and died away;</line>
      <line>And East and West, without a breath,</line>
      <line>Mixt their dim lights, like life and death,</line>
      <line>To broaden into boundless day.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Like ballad-burthen music, kept,</line>

      <line>A cypress in the moonlight shake,</line>

      <line>What more? we took our last adieu,</line>

      <line>I pluck’d a daisy, I gave it you.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It told of England then to me,</line>

      <line>And you fair stars that crown a happy day</line>
      <line>Go in and out as if at merry play,</line>
      <line>Who am no more so all forlorn,</line>
      <line>As when it seem’d far better to be born</line>
      <line>To labour and the mattock-harden’d hand,</line>
      <line>Than nursed at ease and brought to understand</line>
      <line>A sad astrology, the boundless plan</line>
      <line>That makes you tyrants in your iron skies,</line>
      <line>Innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes,</line>
      <line>Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand</line>
      <line>His nothingness into man.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But now shine on, and what care I,</line>
      <line>Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl</line>
      <line>The countercharm of space and hollow sky,</line>
      <line>And do accept my madness, and would die</line>
      <line>To save from some slight shame one simple girl.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Would die; for sullen-seeming Death may give</line>
      <line>More life to Love than is or ever was</line>
      <line>In our low world, where yet ’tis sweet to live.</line>
      <line>Let no one ask me how it came to pass;</line>
      <line>It seems that I am happy, that to me</line>
      <line>A livelier emerald twinkles in the grass,</line>
      <line>A purer sapphire melts into the sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not die; but live a life of truest breath,</line>
      <line>And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs.</line>
      <line>O, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs,</line>
      <line>Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?</line>
      <line>Make answer, Maud my bliss,</line>
      <line>Maud made my Maud by that long loving kiss,</line>
      <line>Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this?</line>
      <line>‘The dusky strand of Death inwoven here</line>
      <line>With dear Love’s tie, makes Love himself more dear.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is that enchanted moan only the swell</line>
      <line>Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay?</line>
      <line>And hark the clock within, the silver knell</line>
      <line>Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white,</line>
      <line>And died to live, long as my pulses play;</line>
      <line>But now by this my love has closed her sight</line>
      <line>And given false death her hand, and stol’n away</line>
      <line>To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell</line>
      <line>Among the fragments of the golden day. 70</line>
      <line>May nothing there her maiden grace affright!</line>
      <line>Dear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell.</line>
      <line>My bride to be, my evermore delight,</line>
      <line>My own heart’s heart, my ownest own, farewell;</line>
      <line>It is but for a little space I go:</line>
      <line>And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell</line>
      <line>Beat to the noiseless music of the night!</line>
      <line>Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow</line>
      <line>Of your soft splendours that you look so bright?</line>
      <line>I have climb’d nearer out of lonely Hell. 80</line>
      <line>Beat, happy stars, timing with things below,</line>
      <line>Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell,</line>
      <line>Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe</line>
      <line>That seems to draw — but it shall not be so:</line>
      <line>Let all be well, be well.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Come into the garden, Maud,</line>
      <line>For the black bat, night, has flown,</line>
      <line>Come into the garden, Maud,</line>
      <line>I am here at the gate alone;</line>
      <line>And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,</line>
      <line>And the musk of the rose is blown.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For a breeze of morning moves,</line>
      <line>And the planet of Love is on high,</line>
      <line>Beginning to faint in the light that she loves</line>
      <line>On a bed of daffodil sky,</line>
      <line>To faint in the light of the sun she loves,</line>
      <line>To faint in his light, and to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All night have the roses heard</line>
      <line>The flute, violin, bassoon;</line>
      <line>All night has the casement jessamine stirr’d</line>
      <line>To the dancers dancing in tune;</line>
      <line>Till a silence fell with the waking bird,</line>
      <line>And a hush with the setting moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I said to the lily, ‘There is but one</line>
      <line>With whom she has heart to be gay.</line>
      <line>When will the dancers leave her alone?</line>
      <line>She is weary of dance and play.’</line>
      <line>Now half to the setting moon are gone,</line>
      <line>And half to the rising day;</line>
      <line>Low on the sand and loud on the stone</line>
      <line>The last wheel echoes away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I said to the rose, ‘The brief night goes</line>
      <line>In babble and revel and wine.</line>
      <line>O young lord-lover, what sighs are those,</line>
      <line>For one that will never be thine?</line>
      <line>But mine, but mine,’ so I sware to the rose,</line>
      <line>‘For ever and ever, mine.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the soul of the rose went into my blood,</line>
      <line>As the music clash’d in the hall;</line>
      <line>And long by the garden lake I stood,</line>
      <line>For I heard your rivulet fall</line>
      <line>From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,</line>
      <line>Our wood, that is dearer than all;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>From the meadow your walks have left so sweet</line>
      <line>That whenever a March-wind sighs</line>
      <line>He sets the jewel-print of your feet</line>
      <line>In violets blue as your eyes,</line>
      <line>To the woody hollows in which we meet</line>
      <line>And the valleys of Paradise.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The slender acacia would not shake</line>
      <line>One long milk-bloom on the tree;</line>
      <line>The white lake-blossom fell into the lake</line>
      <line>As the pimpernel dozed on the lea;</line>
      <line>But the rose was awake all night for your sake,</line>
      <line>Knowing your promise to me;</line>
      <line>The lilies and roses were all awake,</line>
      <line>They sigh’d for the dawn and thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls,</line>
      <line>Come hither, the dances are done,</line>
      <line>In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls,</line>
      <line>Queen lily and rose in one;</line>
      <line>Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls,</line>
      <line>To the flowers, and be their sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There has fallen a splendid tear</line>
      <line>From the passion-flower at the gate.</line>
      <line>She is coming, my dove, my dear;</line>
      <line>She is coming, my life, my fate;</line>
      <line>The red rose cries, ‘She is near, she is near;’</line>
      <line>And the white rose weeps, ‘She is late;’</line>
      <line>The larkspur listens, ‘I hear, I hear;’</line>
      <line>And the lily whispers, ‘I wait.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She is coming, my own, my sweet;</line>
      <line>Were it ever so airy a tread,</line>
      <line>My heart would hear her and beat,</line>
      <line>Were it earth in an earthy bed; 70</line>
      <line>My dust would hear her and beat,</line>
      <line>Had I lain for a century dead;</line>
      <line>Would start and tremble under her feet,</line>
      <line>And blossom in purple and red.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>O that ’twere possible</line>
      <line>After long grief and pain</line>
      <line>To find the arms of my true love</line>
      <line>Round me once again!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When I was wont to meet her</line>
      <line>InThe silent woody places</line>
      <line>By the home that gave me birth,</line>
      <line>We stood tranced in long embraces</line>
      <line>Mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter</line>
      <line>Than anything on earth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A shadow flits before me,</line>
      <line>Not thou, but like to thee:</line>
      <line>Ah Christ, that it were possible</line>
      <line>For one short hour to see</line>
      <line>The souls we loved, that they might tell us</line>
      <line>What and where they be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It leads me forth at evening,</line>
      <line>It lightly winds and steals</line>
      <line>In a cold white robe before me,</line>
      <line>When all my spirit reels</line>
      <line>At the shouts, the leagues of lights,</line>
      <line>And the roaring of the wheels.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Half the night I waste in sighs,</line>
      <line>Half in dreams I sorrow after</line>
      <line>The delight of early skies;</line>
      <line>In a wakeful doze I sorrow</line>
      <line>For the hand, the lips, the eyes,</line>
      <line>For the meeting of the morrow,</line>
      <line>The delight of happy laughter,</line>
      <line>The delight of low replies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis a morning pure and sweet,</line>
      <line>And a dewy splendour falls</line>
      <line>On the little flower that clings</line>
      <line>To the turrets and the walls;</line>
      <line>’Tis a morning pure and sweet,</line>
      <line>And the light and shadow fleet;</line>
      <line>She is walking in the meadow,</line>
      <line>And the woodland echo rings;</line>
      <line>In a moment we shall meet;</line>
      <line>She is singing in the meadow</line>
      <line>And the rivulet at her feet</line>
      <line>Ripples on in light and shadow</line>
      <line>To the ballad that she sings.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Do I hear her sing as of old,</line>
      <line>My bird with the shining head,</line>
      <line>My own dove with the tender eye?</line>
      <line>But there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,</line>
      <line>There is some one dying or dead,</line>
      <line>And a sullen thunder is roll’d;</line>
      <line>For a tumult shakes the city,</line>
      <line>And I wake, my dream is fled;</line>
      <line>In the shuddering dawn, behold,</line>
      <line>Without knowledge, without pity,</line>
      <line>By the curtains of my bed</line>
      <line>That abiding phantom cold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Get thee hence, nor come again,</line>
      <line>Mix not memory with doubt,</line>
      <line>Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,</line>
      <line>Pass and cease to move about!</line>
      <line>’Tis the blot upon the brain</line>
      <line>That will show itself without.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then I rise, the eavedrops falls,</line>
      <line>And the yellow vapours choke</line>
      <line>The great city sounding wide;</line>
      <line>The day comes, a dull red ball</line>
      <line>Wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke</line>
      <line>On the misty river-tide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thro’ the hubbub of the market</line>
      <line>I steal, a wasted frame,</line>
      <line>It crosses here, it crosses there,</line>
      <line>Thro’ all that crowd confused and loud,</line>
      <line>The shadow still the same;</line>
      <line>And on my heavy eyelids</line>
      <line>My anguish hangs like shame.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas for her that met me,</line>
      <line>That heard me softly call,</line>
      <line>Came glimmering thro’ the laurels</line>
      <line>At the quiet evenfall,</line>
      <line>In the garden by the turrets</line>
      <line>Of the old manorial hall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Would the happy spirit descend,</line>
      <line>From the realms of light and song,</line>
      <line>In the chamber or the street,</line>
      <line>As she looks among the blest,</line>
      <line>Should I fear to greet my friend</line>
      <line>Or to say ‘Forgive the wrong,’</line>
      <line>Or to ask her, ‘Take me, sweet,</line>
      <line>To the regions of thy rest’?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the broad light glares and beats,</line>
      <line>And the shadow flits and fleets</line>
      <line>And will not let me be;</line>
      <line>And I loathe the squares and streets,</line>
      <line>And the faces that one meets,</line>
      <line>Hearts with no love for me:</line>
      <line>Always I long to creep</line>
      <line>Into some still cavern deep,</line>
      <line>There to weep, and weep, and weep</line>
      <line>My whole soul out to thee.</line>

      <line>The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,</line>
      <line>The vapours weep their burthen to the ground,</line>
      <line>Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,</line>
      <line>And after many a summer dies the swan.</line>
      <line>Me only cruel immortality</line>
      <line>Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms,</line>
      <line>Here at the quiet limit of the world,</line>
      <line>A white-hair’d shadow roaming like a dream</line>
      <line>The ever-silent spaces of the East,</line>
      <line>Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn.</line>

      <line>Alas! for this gray shadow, once a man—</line>

      <line>To his great heart none other than a God!</line>
      <line>I ask’d thee, ‘Give me immortality.’</line>
      <line>Then didst thou grant mine asking with a smile,</line>
      <line>Like wealthy men, who care not how they give.</line>
      <line>But thy strong Hours indignant work’d their wills,</line>
      <line>And beat me down and marr’d and wasted me,</line>
      <line>And tho’ they could not end me, left me maim’d</line>
      <line>To dwell in presence of immortal youth,</line>
      <line>Immortal age beside immortal youth,</line>
      <line>And all I was, in ashes. Can thy love,</line>
      <line>Thy beauty, make amends, tho’ even now,</line>
      <line>Close over us, the silver star, thy guide,</line>
      <line>Shines in those tremulous eyes that fill with tears</line>
      <line>To hear me? Let me go: take back thy gift:</line>
      <line>Why should a man desire in any way</line>
      <line>To vary from the kindly race of men</line>
      <line>Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance</line>
      <line>Where all should pause, as is most meet for all?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A soft air fans the cloud apart; there comes</line>
      <line>A glimpse of that dark world where I was born.</line>
      <line>Once more the old mysterious glimmer steals</line>
      <line>From thy pure brows, and from thy shoulders pure,</line>
      <line>And bosom beating with a heart renew’d.</line>
      <line>Thy cheek begins to redden thro’ the gloom,</line>
      <line>Thy sweet eyes brighten slowly close to mine,</line>
      <line>Ere yet they blind the stars, and the wild team</line>
      <line>Which love thee, yearning for thy yoke, arise,</line>
      <line>And shake the darkness from their loosen’d manes,</line>
      <line>And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lo! ever thus thou growest beautiful</line>
      <line>In silence, then before thine answer given</line>
      <line>Departest, and thy tears are on my cheek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,</line>
      <line>And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,</line>
      <line>In days far-off, on that dark earth, be true?</line>
      <line>‘The Gods themselves cannot recall their gifts.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ay me! ay me! with what another heart</line>
      <line>In days far-off, and with what other eyes</line>
      <line>I used to watch—if I be he that watch’d—</line>
      <line>The lucid outline forming round thee; saw</line>
      <line>The dim curls kindle into sunny rings;</line>
      <line>Changed with thy mystic change, and felt my blood</line>
      <line>Glow with the glow that slowly crimson’d all</line>
      <line>Thy presence and thy portals, while I lay,</line>
      <line>Mouth, forehead, eyelids, growing dewy-warm</line>
      <line>With kisses balmier than half-opening buds</line>
      <line>Of April, and could hear the lips that kiss’d</line>
      <line>Whispering I knew not what of wild and sweet,</line>
      <line>Like that strange song I heard Apollo sing,</line>
      <line>While Ilion like a mist rose into towers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet hold me not for ever in thine East:</line>
      <line>How can my nature longer mix with thine?</line>
      <line>Coldly thy rosy shadows bathe me, cold</line>
      <line>Are all thy lights, and cold my wrinkled feet</line>
      <line>Upon thy glimmering thresholds, when the steam</line>
      <line>Floats up from those dim fields about the homes</line>
      <line>Of happy men that have the power to die,</line>
      <line>And grassy barrows of the happier dead.</line>
      <line>Release me, and restore me to the ground;</line>
      <line>Thou seest all things, thou wilt see my grave:</line>
      <line>Thou wilt renew thy beauty morn by morn;</line>
      <line>I earth in earth forget these empty courts,</line>
      <line>And thee returning on thy silver wheels.</line>

    <title>To E. FitzGerald</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Old Fitz, who from your suburb grange,</line>
      <line>Where once I tarried for a while,</line>
      <line>Glance at the wheeling Orb of change,</line>
      <line>And greet it with a kindly smile;</line>
      <line>Whom yet I see as there you sit</line>
      <line>Beneath your sheltering garden-tree,</line>
      <line>And while your doves about you flit,</line>
      <line>And plant on shoulder, hand and knee,</line>
      <line>Or on your head their rosy feet,</line>
      <line>As if they knew your diet spares</line>
      <line>Whatever moved in that full sheet</line>
      <line>Let down to Peter at his prayers;</line>
      <line>Who live on milk and meal and grass;</line>
      <line>And once for ten long weeks I tried</line>
      <line>Your table of Pythagoras,</line>
      <line>And seem’d at first ‘a thing enskied’</line>
      <line>(As Shakespeare has it) airy-light</line>
      <line>To float above the ways of men,</line>
      <line>Then fell from that half-spiritual height</line>
      <line>Chill’d, till I tasted flesh again</line>
      <line>One night when earth was winter-black,</line>
      <line>And all the heavens flash’d in frost;</line>
      <line>And on me, half-asleep, came back</line>
      <line>That wholesome heat the blood had lost,</line>
      <line>And set me climbing icy capes</line>
      <line>And glaciers, over which there roll’d</line>
      <line>To meet me long-arm’d vines with grapes</line>
      <line>Of Eshcol hugeness; for the cold</line>
      <line>Without, and warmth within me, wrought</line>
      <line>To mould the dream; but none can say</line>
      <line>That Lenten fare makes Lenten thought,</line>
      <line>Who reads your golden Eastern lay,</line>
      <line>Than which I know no version done</line>
      <line>In English more divinely well;</line>
      <line>A planet equal to the sun</line>
      <line>Which cast it, that large infidel</line>
      <line>Your Omar; and your Omar drew</line>
      <line>Full-handed plaudits from our best</line>
      <line>In modern letters, and from two,</line>
      <line>Old friends outvaluing all the rest,</line>
      <line>Two voices heard on earth no more;</line>
      <line>But we old friends are still alive,</line>
      <line>And I am nearing seventy-four,</line>
      <line>While you have touch’d at seventy-five,</line>
      <line>And so I send a birthday line</line>
      <line>Of greeting; and my son, who dipt</line>
      <line>In some forgotten book of mine</line>
      <line>With sallow scraps of manuscript,</line>
      <line>And dating many a year ago,</line>
      <line>Has hit on this, which you will take</line>
      <line>My Fitz, and welcome, as I know</line>
      <line>Less for its own than for the sake</line>
      <line>Of one recalling gracious times,</line>
      <line>When, in our younger London days,</line>
      <line>You found some merit in my rhymes,</line>
      <line>And I more pleasure in your praise.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Come, walk with me;</line>
      <line>There’s only thee</line>
      <line>To bless my spirit now;</line>
      <line>We used to love on winter nights</line>
      <line>To wander through the snow.</line>
      <line>Can we not woo back old delights?</line>
      <line>The clouds rush dark and wild;</line>
      <line>They fleck with shade our mountain heights</line>
      <line>The same as long ago,</line>
      <line>And on the horizon rest at last</line>
      <line>In looming masses piled;</line>
      <line>While moonbeams flash and fly so fast</line>
      <line>We scarce can say they smiled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Come, walk with me — come, walk with me;</line>
      <line>We were not once so few;</line>
      <line>But Death has stolen our company</line>
      <line>As sunshine steals the dew:</line>
      <line>He took them one by one, and we</line>
      <line>Are left, the only two;</line>
      <line>So closer would my feelings twine,</line>
      <line>Because they have no stay but thine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Nay, call me not; it may not be;</line>
      <line>Is human love so true?</line>
      <line>Can Friendship’s flower droop on for years</line>
      <line>And then revive anew?</line>
      <line>No; though the soil be wet with tears,</line>
      <line>How fair soe’er it grew;</line>
      <line>The vital sap once perished</line>
      <line>Will never flow again;</line>
      <line>And surer than that dwelling dread,</line>
      <line>The narrow dungeon of the dead,</line>
      <line>Time parts the hearts of men.’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Cold in the earth, and the deep snow piled above thee!</line>
      <line>Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!</line>
      <line>Have I forgot, my Only Love, to love thee,</line>
      <line>Severed at last by Time’s all-wearing wave?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover</line>
      <line>Over the mountains on Angora’s shore;</line>
      <line>Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover</line>
      <line>That noble heart for ever, ever more?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Cold in the earth, and fifteen wild Decembers</line>
      <line>From those brown hills have melted into spring—</line>
      <line>Faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers</line>
      <line>After such years of change and suffering!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sweet Love of youth, forgive if I forget thee</line>
      <line>While the World’s tide is bearing me along:</line>
      <line>Sterner desires and darker hopes beset me,</line>
      <line>Hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No other Sun has lightened up my heaven;</line>
      <line>No other Star has ever shone for me:</line>

      <line>All my life’s bliss is in the grave with thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when the days of golden dreams had perished</line>
      <line>And even Despair was powerless to destroy,</line>
      <line>Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,</line>
      <line>Strengthened and fed without the aid of joy;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then did I check the tears of useless passion,</line>
      <line>Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;</line>
      <line>Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten</line>
      <line>Down to that tomb already more than mine!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And even yet, I dare not let it languish,</line>
      <line>Dare not indulge in Memory’s rapturous pain;</line>
      <line>Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,</line>
      <line>How could I seek the empty world again?</line>

    <title>The Prisoner</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In the dungeon-crypts, idly did I stray,</line>
      <line>Reckless of the lives wasting there away;</line>
      <line>‘Draw the ponderous bars! open, Warder stern!’</line>
      <line>He dared not say me nay—the hinges harshly turn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Our guests are darkly lodged,’ I whisper’d, gazing through</line>
      <line>The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more grey than blue;</line>
      <line>(This was when glad spring laughed in awaking pride;)</line>
      <line>‘Aye, darkly lodged enough!’ returned my sullen guide.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, God forgive my youth; forgive my careless tongue;</line>
      <line>I scoffed, as the chill chains on the damp flag-stones rung:</line>
      <line>‘Confined in triple walls, art thou so much to fear,</line>
      <line>That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The captive raised her face, it was as soft and mild</line>
      <line>As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering unwean’d child;</line>
      <line>It was so soft and mild, it was so sweet and fair,</line>
      <line>Pain could not trace a line, nor grief a shadow there!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow;</line>
      <line>‘I have been struck,’ she said, ‘and I am suffering now;</line>
      <line>Yet these are little worth, your bolts and irons strong,</line>
      <line>And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold me long.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Hoarse laughed the jailor grim: ‘Shall I be won to hear;</line>
      <line>Dost think, fond, dreaming wretch, that / shall grant thy prayer?</line>
      <line>Or, better still, wilt melt my master’s heart with groans?</line>
      <line>Ah! sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘My master’s voice is low, his aspect bland and kind,</line>
      <line>But hard as hardest flint, the soul that lurks behind;</line>
      <line>And I am rough and rude, yet not more rough to see</line>
      <line>Than is the hidden ghost that has its home in me.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn,</line>
      <line>‘My friend,’ she gently said, ‘you have not heard me mourn;</line>
      <line>When you my kindred’s lives, my lost life, can restore,</line>
      <line>Then may I weep and sue,—but never, friend, before!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Still, let my tyrants know, I am not doomed to wear</line>
      <line>Year after year in gloom, and desolate despair;</line>
      <line>A messenger of Hope, comes every night to me,</line>
      <line>And offers for short life, eternal liberty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He comes with western winds, with evening’s wandering airs,</line>
      <line>With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars.</line>
      <line>Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,</line>
      <line>And visions rise, and change, that kill me with desire.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Desire for nothing known in my maturer years,</line>
      <line>When Joy grew mad with awe, at counting future tears.</line>
      <line>When, if my spirit’s sky was full of flashes warm,</line>
      <line>I knew not whence they came, from sun, or thunder storm.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, first, a hush of peace—a soundless calm descends;</line>
      <line>The struggle of distress, and fierce impatience ends.</line>
      <line>Mute music soothes my breast, unuttered harmony,</line>
      <line>That I could never dream, till Earth was lost to me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals;</line>
      <line>My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels:</line>
      <line>Its wings are almost free—its home, its harbour found,</line>
      <line>Measuring the gulph, it stoops, and dares the final bound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, dreadful is the check—intense the agony—</line>
      <line>When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see;</line>
      <line>When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again,</line>
      <line>The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less,</line>
      <line>The more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless;</line>
      <line>And robed in fires of hell, or bright with heavenly shine,</line>
      <line>If it but herald death, the vision is divine!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She ceased to speak, and we, unanswering, turned to go—</line>
      <line>We had no further power to work the captive woe:</line>
      <line>Her cheek, her gleaming eye, declared that man had given</line>
      <line>A sentence, unapproved, and overruled by Heaven.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Silent is the house: all are laid asleep:</line>
      <line>One alone looks out o’er the snow-wreaths deep;</line>

      <line>That whirls the wildering drift, and bends the groaning trees.</line>

      <line>Not one shivering gust creeps through pane or door;</line>

      <line>I trim it well, to be the wanderer’s guiding-star.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>Frown, my haughty sire! chide, my angry dame;</line>
      <line>Set your slaves to spy; threaten me with shame:</line>
      <line>But neither sire nor dame, nor prying serf shall know,</line>
      <line>What angel nightly tracks that waste of frozen snow.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What I love shall come like visitant of air,</line>
      <line>Safe in secret power from lurking human snare;</line>

      <line>Strange Power! I trust thy might; trust thou my constancy.</line>

      <line>How good for me had been strange griefs of old,</line>
      <line>That for long days, months, years, inured my wits</line>
      <line>To bear the dreadful burden of one thought.</line>
      <line>One thought with woful need turned many ways,</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Though Shakespeare asks us, ‘What’s in a name?’</line>
      <line>(As if cognomens were much the same),</line>
      <line>There’s really a very great scope in it.</line>
      <line>A name?—why, wasn’t there Doctor Dodd,</line>
      <line>That servant at once of Mammon and God,</line>
      <line>Who found four thousand pounds and odd,</line>
      <line>A prison—a cart—and a rope in it?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A name?—if the party had a voice,</line>
      <line>What mortal would be a Bugg by choice,</line>
      <line>As a Hogg, a Grubb, or a Chubb rejoice,</line>
      <line>Or any such nauseous blazon?</line>
      <line>Not to mention many a vulgar name,</line>
      <line>That would make a doorplate blush for shame,</line>
      <line>If doorplates were not so brazen!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A name?—it has more than nominal worth,</line>
      <line>And belongs to good or bad luck at birth—</line>
      <line>As dames of a certain degree know,</line>
      <line>In spite of his Page’s hat and hose,</line>
      <line>His Page’s jacket, and buttons in rows,</line>

      <line>For a minor rich as a Mexican.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then cards were sent, the presence to beg</line>

      <line>White, yellow, and brown relations:</line>
      <line>Brothers, Wardens of City Halls,</line>

      <line>From taking pledges of nations.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nephews, whom Fortune seem’d to bewitch,</line>
      <line>Rising in life like rockets—</line>
      <line>Nieces whose dowries knew no hitch—</line>
      <line>Aunts as certain of dying rich</line>

      <line>Cousins German and cousins’ sons,</line>

      <line>Posed Ali Baba’s brother’s wife)—</line>
      <line>And down to the Cousins and Cozlings,</line>
      <line>The fortunate brood of the Kilmanseggs,</line>

      <line>To renounce all pomp and vanity.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To paint the maternal Kilmansegg,</line>
      <line>The pen of an Eastern Poet would beg,</line>
      <line>And need an elaborate sonnet;</line>
      <line>How she sparkled with gems whenever she stirr’d,</line>
      <line>And her head niddle-noddled at every word,</line>
      <line>And seem’d so happy, a Paradise Bird</line>
      <line>Had nidificated upon it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Sir Jacob the Father strutted and bow’d,</line>
      <line>And smiled to himself, and laugh’d aloud,</line>
      <line>To think of his heiress and daughter—</line>
      <line>And then in his pockets he made a grope,</line>
      <line>And then, in the fulness of joy and hope,</line>
      <line>Seem’d washing his hands with invisible soap,</line>
      <line>In imperceptible water.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had roll’d in money like pigs in mud,</line>
      <line>Till it seem’d to have enter’d into his blood</line>
      <line>By some occult projection:</line>
      <line>And his cheeks, instead of a healthy hue,</line>
      <line>As yellow as any guinea grew,</line>
      <line>Making the common phrase seem true</line>
      <line>About a rich complexion.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now came the Nurse, and during a pause,</line>
      <line>Her dead-leaf satin would fitly cause</line>
      <line>A very autumnal rustle—</line>
      <line>So full of figure, so full of fuss,</line>
      <line>As she carried about the babe to buss,</line>

      <line>Won by Raleigh in days of old,</line>
      <line>In spite of Spanish bravado;</line>

      <line>With gilt devices, it shone in the sun,</line>
      <line>Like a copy—a presentation one—</line>
      <line>Of Humboldt’s ‘El Dorado.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Gold! and gold! and nothing but gold!</line>
      <line>The same auriferous shine behold i0o</line>
      <line>Wherever the eye could settle!</line>
      <line>On the walls—the sideboard—the ceiling-skv—</line>
      <line>On the gorgeous footmen standing by,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Gold! and gold! and besides the gold,</line>
      <line>The very robe of the infant told</line>
      <line>A tale of wealth in every fold;</line>
      <line>It lapp’d her like a vapour!</line>
      <line>So fine! so thin! the mind at a loss no</line>

      <line>Of cobwebs with bank-note paper.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then her pearls—’twas a perfect sight, forsooth,</line>
      <line>To see them, like ‘the dew of her youth,’</line>
      <line>In such a plentiful sprinkle.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile, the Vicar read through the form,</line>
      <line>And gave her another, not overwarm,</line>
      <line>That made her little eyes twinkle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then the babe was cross’d, and bless’d amain,</line>
      <line>But instead of the Kate, or Ann, or Jane,</line>
      <line>Which the humbler female endorses,</line>
      <line>Instead of one name, as some people prefix,</line>
      <line>Kilmansegg went at the tails of six,</line>
      <line>Like a carriage of state with its horses.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, then the kisses she got and hugs!</line>
      <line>The golden mugs and the golden jugs,</line>

      <line>The golden knives, and the golden spoons,</line>

      <line>The company ate and drank from gold,</line>

      <line>And one of the Gold Sticks rose from his chair,</line>

      <line>In a bumper of golden Sherry.</line>

      <line>There was nothing but guineas glistening!</line>
      <line>Fifty were given to Doctor James</line>

    <title>from Miss Kilmansegg and her Precious Leg (Her Precious Leg)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined,’</line>
      <line>Is an adage often recall’d to mind,</line>
      <line>Referring to juvenile bias:</line>
      <line>And never so well is the verity seen,</line>
      <line>As when to the weak, warp’d side we lean,</line>
      <line>While Life’s tempests and hurricanes try us.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Even thus with Miss K. and her broken limb,</line>
      <line>By a very, very remarkable whim,</line>
      <line>She show’d her early tuition:</line>
      <line>While the buds of character came into blow</line>
      <line>With a certain tinge that served to show</line>
      <line>The nursery culture long ago,</line>
      <line>As the graft is known by fruition!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For the King’s Physician, who nursed the case,</line>
      <line>His verdict gave with an awful face,</line>
      <line>And three others concurr’d to egg it:</line>
      <line>That the Patient to give old Death the slip,</line>
      <line>Like the Pope, instead of a personal trip,</line>
      <line>Must send her Leg as a Legate.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The limb was doom’d—it couldn’t be saved!</line>
      <line>And like other people the patient behaved,</line>
      <line>Nay, bravely that cruel parting braved,</line>
      <line>Which makes some persons so falter;</line>
      <line>They rather would part without a groan,</line>
      <line>With the flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone,</line>
      <line>They obtained at St George’s altar.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when it came to fitting the stump</line>
      <line>With a proxy limb—then flatly and plump</line>
      <line>She spoke, in the spirit olden;</line>
      <line>She couldn’t—she shouldn’t—she wouldn’t have wood!</line>
      <line>Nor a leg of cork, if she never stood,</line>
      <line>And she swore an oath, or something as good,</line>
      <line>The proxy limb should be golden!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A wooden leg! what, a sort of peg,</line>
      <line>For your common Jockeys and Jennies!</line>
      <line>No, no, her mother might worry and plague—</line>
      <line>Weep, go down on her knees, and beg,</line>
      <line>But nothing would move Miss Kilmansegg!</line>
      <line>She could—she would have a Golden Leg,</line>
      <line>If it cost ten thousand guineas!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wood indeed, in Forest or Park,</line>
      <line>With its sylvan honours and feudal bark,</line>
      <line>Is an aristocratical article;</line>
      <line>But split and sawn, and hack’d about town,</line>
      <line>Serving all needs of pauper or clown,</line>
      <line>Trod on! staggered on! Wood cut down</line>
      <line>Is vulgar—fibre and particle!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And Cork!—when the noble Cork Tree shades</line>
      <line>A lovely group of Castilian maids,</line>
      <line>’Tis a thing for a song or sonnet!—</line>
      <line>But cork, as it stops the bottle of gin,</line>
      <line>Or bungs the beer—the small beer!—in—</line>
      <line>It pierced her heart like a corking-pin,</line>
      <line>To think of standing upon it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A Leg of Gold—solid gold throughout,</line>
      <line>Nothing else, whether slim or stout,</line>
      <line>Should ever support her, God willing!</line>
      <line>She must—she could—she would have her whim,</line>
      <line>Her father, she turned a deaf ear to him—</line>
      <line>He might kill her—she didn’t mind killing!</line>
      <line>He was welcome to cut off her other limb—</line>
      <line>He might cut her all off with a shilling!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All other promised gifts were in vain,</line>
      <line>Golden Girdle, or Golden Chain,</line>
      <line>She writhed with impatience more than pain,</line>
      <line>And uttered ‘pshaws!’ and ‘pishes!’</line>
      <line>But a Leg of Gold! as she lay in bed,</line>
      <line>It danced before her—it ran in her head!</line>
      <line>It jump’d with her dearest wishes!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Gold—gold—gold! Oh, let it be gold!’</line>
      <line>Asleep or awake that tale she told,</line>
      <line>And when she grew delirious:</line>
      <line>Till her parents resolved to grant her wish,</line>
      <line>If they melted down plate, and goblet, and dish,</line>
      <line>The case was getting so serious.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So a Leg was made in a comely mould,</line>
      <line>Of Gold, fine virgin glittering gold,</line>
      <line>As solid as man could make it—</line>
      <line>Solid in foot, and calf, and shank,</line>
      <line>A prodigious sum of money it sank;</line>
      <line>In fact ’twas a Branch of the family Bank,</line>
      <line>And no easy matter to break it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All sterling metal—not half-and-half,</line>
      <line>The Goldsmith’s mark was stamped on the calf—</line>
      <line>’Twas pure as from Mexican barter!</line>
      <line>And to make it more costly, just over the knee—</line>
      <line>Where another ligature used to be,</line>
      <line>Was a circle of Jewels, worth shillings to see,</line>
      <line>A new-fangled Badge of the Garter!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas a splendid, brilliant, beautiful Leg,</line>
      <line>Fit for the Court of Scander-Beg,</line>
      <line>That Precious Leg of Miss Kilmansegg!</line>
      <line>For, thanks to parental bounty,</line>
      <line>Secure from Mortification’s touch,</line>
      <line>She stood on a Member that cost as much</line>
      <line>As a Member for all the County!</line>

    <title>from Mrs Kilmansegg and her Precious Leg (Her Death)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis a stern and startling thing to think</line>
      <line>How often mortality stands on the brink</line>
      <line>Of its grave without any misgiving:</line>
      <line>And yet in this slippery world of strife,</line>
      <line>In the stir of human bustle so rife,</line>
      <line>There are daily sounds to tell us that Life</line>
      <line>Is dying, and Death is living!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ay, Beauty the Girl, and Love the Boy,</line>
      <line>Bright as they are with hope and joy,</line>
      <line>How their souls would sadden instanter,</line>
      <line>To remember that one of those wedding-bells,</line>
      <line>That ring so merrily through the dells,</line>
      <line>Is the same that knells</line>
      <line>Our last farewells,</line>
      <line>Only broken into a canter!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But breath and blood set doom at nought—</line>
      <line>How little the wretched Countess thought,</line>
      <line>When at night she unloos’d her sandal,</line>
      <line>That the Fates had woven her burial-cloth,</line>
      <line>And that Death, in the shape of a Death’s Head Moth,</line>
      <line>Was fluttering round her candle!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As she look’d at her clock of or-molu,</line>
      <line>For the hours she had gone so wearily through</line>
      <line>At the end of a day of trial—</line>
      <line>How little she saw in her pride of prime</line>
      <line>The Dart of Death in the Hand of Time—</line>
      <line>That hand which mov’d on the dial!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As she went with her taper up the stair,</line>
      <line>How little her swollen eye was aware</line>
      <line>That the shadow which follow’d was double!</line>
      <line>Or when she clos’d her chamber door,</line>
      <line>It was shutting out, and for evermore,</line>
      <line>The world—and its worldly trouble.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Little she dreamt, as she laid aside</line>
      <line>Her jewels—after one glance of pride—</line>
      <line>They were solemn bequests to Vanity—</line>
      <line>Or when her robe she began to doff,</line>
      <line>That she stood so near to the putting off</line>
      <line>Of the flesh that clothes humanity.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when she quench’d the taper’s light,</line>
      <line>How little she thought as the smoke took flight,</line>
      <line>That her day was done—and merg’d in a night</line>
      <line>Of dreams and duration uncertain—</line>
      <line>Or, along with her own,</line>
      <line>That a hand of bone</line>
      <line>Was closing mortality’s curtain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But life is sweet, and mortality blind,</line>
      <line>And youth is hopeful, and Fate is kind</line>
      <line>In concealing the day of sorrow;</line>
      <line>And enough is the present tense of toil—</line>
      <line>For this world is, to all, a stiffish soil—</line>
      <line>And the mind flies back with a glad recoil</line>
      <line>From the debts not due till tomorrow.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wherefore else does the Spirit fly</line>
      <line>And bid its daily cares good-bye,</line>
      <line>Along with its daily clothing?</line>
      <line>Just as the Felon condemn’d to die—</line>
      <line>With a very natural loathing—</line>
      <line>Leaving the Sheriff to dream of ropes,</line>
      <line>From his gloomy cell in a vision elopes,</line>
      <line>To caper on sunny greens and slopes,</line>
      <line>Instead of the dance upon nothing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus, even thus, the Countess slept,</line>
      <line>While Death still nearer and nearer crept,</line>
      <line>Like the Thane who smote the sleeping—</line>
      <line>But her mind was busy with early joys,</line>
      <line>Her golden treasures and golden toys,</line>
      <line>That flash’d a bright</line>
      <line>And golden light</line>
      <line>Under lids still red with weeping.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The golden doll that she used to hug!</line>
      <line>Her coral of gold, and the golden mug!</line>
      <line>Her godfather’s golden presents!</line>
      <line>The golden service she had at her meals,</line>
      <line>The golden watch, and chain, and seals,</line>
      <line>Her golden scissors, and thread, and reels,</line>
      <line>And her golden fishes and pheasants!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The golden guineas in silken purse—</line>
      <line>And the Golden Legends she heard from her nurse,</line>
      <line>Of the Mayor in his gilded carriage—</line>
      <line>And London streets that were pav’d with gold—</line>
      <line>And the Golden Eggs that were laid of old—</line>
      <line>With each golden thing</line>
      <line>To the golden ring</line>
      <line>At her own auriferous Marriage!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And still the golden light of the sun</line>
      <line>Through her golden dream appear’d to run,</line>
      <line>Though the night that roar’d without was one</line>
      <line>To terrify seamen or gipsies—</line>
      <line>While the moon, as if in malicious mirth,</line>
      <line>Kept peeping down at the ruffled earth,</line>
      <line>As though she enjoyed the tempest’s birth,</line>
      <line>In revenge of her old eclipses.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But vainly, vainly, the thunder fell,</line>
      <line>For the soul of the sleeper was under a spell</line>
      <line>That Time had lately embitter’d—</line>
      <line>The Count, as once at her feet he knelt—</line>
      <line>That Foot which now he wanted to melt!</line>
      <line>But—hush!—’twas a stir at her pillow she felt—</line>
      <line>And some object before her glitter’d.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Twas the Golden Leg!—she knew its gleam!</line>
      <line>And up she started, and tried to scream,—</line>
      <line>But ev’n in the moment she started—</line>
      <line>Down came the limb with a frightful smash,</line>
      <line>And, lost in the universal flash</line>
      <line>That her eyeballs made at so mortal a crash,</line>
      <line>The Spark, called Vital, departed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Gold, still gold! hard, yellow, and cold,</line>
      <line>For gold she had lived, and she died for gold—</line>
      <line>By a golden weapon—not oaken; no</line>
      <line>In the morning they found her all alone—</line>
      <line>Stiff, and bloody, and cold as stone—</line>
      <line>But her Leg, the Golden Leg, was gone,</line>
      <line>And the ‘Golden Bowl was broken!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Gold, still gold! it haunted her yet—</line>
      <line>At the Golden Lion the Inquest met—</line>

      <line>O, the rain, the weary, dreary rain,</line>
      <line>How it plashes on the window-sill!</line>
      <line>Night, I guess too, must be on the wane,</line>
      <line>Strass and Gass around are grown so still.</line>
      <line>Here I sit, with coffee in my cup—</line>
      <line>Ah! ’twas rarely I beheld it flow</line>
      <line>In the taverns where I loved to sup</line>
      <line>Twenty golden years ago!</line>

      <line>Twenty years ago, alas!—but stay,</line>
      <line>On my life, ’tis half-past twelve o’clock!</line>
      <line>After all, the hours do slip away—</line>
      <line>Come, here goes to burn another block!</line>
      <line>For the night, or morn, is wet and cold,</line>
      <line>And my fire is dwindling rather low:—</line>
      <line>I had fire enough, when young and bold,</line>

      <line>Dear! I don’t feel well at all, somehow:</line>
      <line>Few in Weimar dream how bad I am;</line>
      <line>Floods of tears grow common with me now,</line>
      <line>High-Dutch floods, that Reason cannot dam.</line>
      <line>Doctors think I’ll neither live nor thrive</line>
      <line>If I mope at home so—I don’t know—</line>

      <line>Not a soul to woo, except the Muse—</line>
      <line>O! this, this is hard for me to bear,</line>
      <line>Me, who whilome lived so much en haul,</line>

      <line>They who curse me nightly from their graves</line>
      <line>Scarce could love me were they living now;</line>
      <line>But my loneliness hath darker ills—</line>

      <line>More to wail about than Kerner has!</line>
      <line>Kerner’s tears are wept for withered flowers,</line>
      <line>Mine for withered hopes; my Scroll of Woe</line>
      <line>Dates, alas! from Youth’s deserted bowers,</line>
      <line>Twenty golden years ago!</line>

      <line>Yet may Deutschland’s bardlings flourish long!</line>
      <line>Me, I tweak no beak among them;—hawks</line>
      <line>Must not pounce on hawks; besides, in song</line>
      <line>I could once beat all of them by chalks.</line>
      <line>Though you find me, as I near my goal,</line>
      <line>Sentimentalising like Rousseau,</line>

      <line>Tick-tick, tick-tick!—Not a sound save Time’s,</line>
      <line>And the windgust, as it drives the rain—</line>
      <line>Tortured torturer of reluctant rhymes,</line>
      <line>Go to bed, and rest thine aching brain!</line>
      <line>Sleep!—no more the dupe of hopes or schemes;</line>
      <line>Soon thou sleepest where the thistles blow—</line>
      <line>Curious anticlimax to thy dreams</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There’s a pretty fuss and bother both in country and in town,</line>
      <line>Since we have got a present, and an heir unto the Crown,</line>
      <line>A little Prince of Wales so charming and so sly,</line>
      <line>And the ladies shout with wonder, What a pretty little boy!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He must have a little musket, a trumpet and a kite,</line>
      <line>A little penny rattle, and silver sword so bright,</line>
      <line>A little cap and feather with scarlet coat so smart,</line>
      <line>And a pretty little hobby horse to ride about the park.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Prince Albert he will often take the young Prince on his lap,</line>
      <line>And fondle him so lovingly, while he stirs about the pap,</line>
      <line>He will pin on his flannel before he takes his nap,</line>
      <line>Then dress him out so stylish with his little clouts and cap.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He must have a dandy suit to strut about the town,</line>
      <line>John Bull must rake together six or seven thousand pound,</line>
      <line>You’d laugh to see his daddy, at night he homeward runs,</line>
      <line>With some peppermint or lollipops, sweet cakes and sugar plums.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He will want a little fiddle, and a little German flute,</line>
      <line>A little pair of stockings and a pretty pair of boots,</line>
      <line>With a handsome pair of spurs, and a golden headed cane,</line>
      <line>And a stick of barley sugar, as long as Drury Lane.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>An old maid ran through the palace, which did the nobs surprize,</line>
      <line>Bawling out, he’s got his daddy’s mouth, his mammy’s nose and eyes,</line>
      <line>He will be as like his daddy as a frigate to a ship,</line>
      <line>If he’d only got mustachios upon his upper lip.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now to get these little niceties the taxes must be rose,</line>
      <line>For the little Prince of Wales wants so many suits of clothes,</line>
      <line>So they must tax the frying pan, the windows and the doors,</line>
      <line>The bedsteads and the tables, kitchen pokers, and the floors.</line>

      <line>I’ll sing you a new ballad, and I’ll warrant it first-rate,</line>
      <line>Of the days of that old gentleman who had that old estate;</line>
      <line>When they spent the public money at a bountiful old rate</line>
      <line>On ev’ry mistress, pimp, and scamp, at ev’ry noble gate,</line>
      <line>In the fine old English Tory times;</line>
      <line>Soon may they come again!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The good old laws were garnished well with gibbets, whips, and chains,</line>
      <line>With fine old English penalties, and fine old English pains,</line>
      <line>With rebel heads, and seas of blood once hot in rebel veins;</line>
      <line>For all these things were requisite to guard the rich old gains</line>
      <line>Of the fine old English Tory times;</line>
      <line>Soon may they come again!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This brave old code, like Argus, had a hundred watchful eyes,</line>
      <line>And ev’ry English peasant had his good old English spies,</line>
      <line>To tempt his starving discontent with fine old English lies,</line>
      <line>Then call the good old Yeomanry to stop his peevish cries,</line>

      <line>Came down direct from Paradise at more than railroad speed. . . .</line>
      <line>Oh the fine old English Tory times;</line>
      <line>When will they come again!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In those rare days, the press was seldom known to snarl or bark,</line>
      <line>But sweetly sang of men in pow’r, like any tuneful lark;</line>
      <line>Grave judges, too, to all their evil deeds were in the dark;</line>
      <line>And not a man in twenty score knew how to make his mark.</line>

      <line>Those were the days for taxes, and for war’s infernal din;</line>
      <line>For scarcity of bread, that fine old dowagers might win;</line>
      <line>For shutting men of letters up, through iron bars to grin,</line>
      <line>Because they didn’t think the Prince was altogether thin,</line>

      <line>Soon may they come again!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>But Tolerance, though slow in flight, is strong-wing’d in the main;</line>
      <line>That night must come on these fine days, in course of time was plain;</line>
      <line>The pure old spirit struggled, but its struggles were in vain;</line>
      <line>A nation’s grip was on it, and it died in choking pain,</line>
      <line>With the fine old English Tory days,</line>

      <line>The bright old day now dawns again; the cry runs through the land,</line>
      <line>In England there shall be dear bread—in Ireland, sword and brand;</line>
      <line>And poverty, and ignorance, shall swell the rich and grand,</line>
      <line>So, rally round the rulers with the gentle iron hand,</line>
      <line>Of the fine old English Tory days;</line>
      <line>Hail to the coming time!</line>

      <line>The lilies of our lives may reassure</line>
      <line>Their blossoms from their roots, accessible</line>
      <line>Alone to heavenly dews that drop not fewer,</line>
      <line>Growing straight, out of man’s reach, on the hill.</line>
      <line>God only, who made us rich, can make us poor.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Of writing many books there is no end;</line>
      <line>And I who have written much in prose and verse</line>
      <line>For others’ uses, will write now for mine,—</line>
      <line>Will write my story for my better self,</line>
      <line>As when you paint your portrait for a friend,</line>
      <line>Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it</line>
      <line>Long after he has ceased to love you, just</line>
      <line>To hold together what he was and is.</line>
      <line>I, writing thus, am still what men call young;</line>
      <line>I have not so far left the coasts of life</line>
      <line>To travel inward, that I cannot hear</line>
      <line>That murmur of the outer Infinite</line>
      <line>Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep</line>
      <line>When wondered at for smiling; not so far,</line>
      <line>But still I catch my mother at her post</line>
      <line>Beside the nursery door, with finger up,</line>
      <line>‘Hush, hush—here’s too much noise!’ while her sweet eyes</line>
      <line>Leap forward, taking part against her word</line>
      <line>In the child’s riot. Still I sit and feel</line>
      <line>My father’s slow hand, when she had left us both,</line>
      <line>Stroke out my childish curls across his knee,</line>
      <line>And hear Assunta’s daily jest (she knew</line>
      <line>He liked it better than a better jest)</line>
      <line>Inquire how many golden scudi went</line>
      <line>To make such ringlets. O my father’s hand,</line>
      <line>Stroke heavily, heavily the poor hair down,</line>
      <line>Draw, press the child’s head closer to thy knee!</line>
      <line>I’m still too young, too young, to sit alone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I write. My mother was a Florentine,</line>
      <line>Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me</line>
      <line>When scarcely I was four years old, my life</line>
      <line>A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp</line>
      <line>Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail;</line>
      <line>She could not bear the joy of giving life,</line>
      <line>The mother’s rapture slew her. If her kiss</line>
      <line>Had left a longer weight upon my lips</line>
      <line>It might have steadied the uneasy breath,</line>
      <line>And reconciled and fraternised my soul</line>
      <line>With the new order. As it was, indeed,</line>
      <line>I felt a mother-want about the world,</line>
      <line>And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb</line>
      <line>Left out at night in shutting up the fold,—</line>
      <line>As restless as a nest-deserted bird</line>
      <line>Grown chill through something being away, though what</line>
      <line>It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born</line>
      <line>To make my father sadder, and myself</line>
      <line>Not overjoyous, truly. Women know</line>
      <line>The way to rear up children (to be just),</line>
      <line>They know a simple, merry, tender knack</line>
      <line>Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,</line>
      <line>And stringing pretty words that make no sense,</line>
      <line>And kissing full sense into empty words,</line>
      <line>Which things are corals to cut life upon,</line>
      <line>Although such trifles: children learn by such,</line>
      <line>Love’s holy earnest in a pretty play</line>
      <line>And get not over-early solemnised,</line>
      <line>But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love’s Divine</line>
      <line>Which burns and hurts not,—not a single bloom,—</line>
      <line>Become aware and unafraid of Love.</line>
      <line>Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well</line>
      <line>—Mine did, I know,—but still with heavier brains,</line>
      <line>And wills more consciously responsible,</line>
      <line>And not as wisely, since less foolishly;</line>
      <line>So mothers have God’s license to be missed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My father was an austere Englishman,</line>
      <line>Who, after a dry lifetime spent at home</line>
      <line>In college-learning, law, and parish talk,</line>
      <line>Was flooded with a passion unaware,</line>
      <line>His whole provisioned and complacent past</line>
      <line>Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood</line>
      <line>In Florence, where he had come to spend a month</line>
      <line>And note the secret of Da Vinci’s drains,</line>
      <line>He musing somewhat absently perhaps</line>
      <line>Some English question . . . whether men should pay</line>
      <line>The unpopular but necessary tax</line>
      <line>With left or right hand—in the alien sun</line>
      <line>In that great square of the Santissima</line>
      <line>There drifted past him (scarcely marked enough</line>
      <line>To move his comfortable island scorn)</line>
      <line>A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,</line>
      <line>The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up</line>
      <line>Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant</line>
      <line>To the blue luminous tremor of the air,</line>
      <line>And letting drop the white wax as they went</line>
      <line>To eat the bishop’s wafer at the church;</line>
      <line>From which long trail of chanting priests and girls,</line>
      <line>A face flashed like a cymbal on his face</line>
      <line>And shook with silent clangour brain and heart,</line>
      <line>Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus,</line>
      <line>He too received his sacramental gift</line>
      <line>With eucharistic meanings; for he loved.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus beloved, she died. I’ve heard it said</line>
      <line>That but to see him in the first surprise</line>
      <line>Of widower and father, nursing me,</line>
      <line>Unmothered little child of four years old,</line>
      <line>His large man’s hands afraid to touch my curls,</line>
      <line>As if the gold would tarnish,—his grave lips</line>
      <line>Contriving such a miserable smile</line>
      <line>As if he knew needs must, or I should die,</line>
      <line>And yet ’twas hard,—would almost make the stones 100</line>
      <line>Cry out for pity. There’s a verse he set</line>
      <line>In Santa Croce to her memory,—</line>
      <line>‘Weep for an infant too young to weep much</line>
      <line>When death removed this mother’—stops the mirth</line>
      <line>To-day on women’s faces when they walk</line>
      <line>With rosy children hanging on their gowns,</line>
      <line>Under the cloister to escape the sun</line>
      <line>That scorches in the piazza. After which</line>
      <line>He left our Florence and made haste to hide</line>
      <line>Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief,</line>
      <line>Among the mountains above Pelago;</line>
      <line>Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need</line>
      <line>Of mother nature more than others use,</line>
      <line>And Pan’s white goats, with udders warm and full</line>
      <line>Of mystic contemplations, come to feed</line>
      <line>Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own—</line>
      <line>Such scholar-scraps he talked, I’ve heard from friends,</line>
      <line>For even prosaic men who wear grief long</line>
      <line>Will get to wear it as a hat aside</line>
      <line>With a flower stuck in’t. Father, then, and child,</line>
      <line>We lived among the mountains many years,</line>
      <line>God’s silence on the outside of the house,</line>
      <line>And we who did not speak too loud within,</line>
      <line>And old Assunta to make up the fire,</line>
      <line>Crossing herself whene’er a sudden flame</line>
      <line>Which lightened from the firewood, made alive</line>
      <line>That picture of my mother on the wall.</line>
      <line>The painter drew it after she was dead,</line>
      <line>And when the face was finished, throat and hands,</line>
      <line>Fler cameriera carried him, in hate</line>
      <line>Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade</line>
      <line>She dressed in at the Pitti; ‘he should paint</line>
      <line>No sadder thing than that,’ she swore, ‘to wrong</line>
      <line>Her poor signora.’ Therefore very strange</line>
      <line>The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch</line>
      <line>For hours upon the floor with knees drawn up,</line>
      <line>And gaze across them, half in terror, half</line>
      <line>In adoration, at the picture there,—</line>
      <line>That swan-like supernatural white life</line>
      <line>Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk</line>
      <line>Which seemed to have no part in it nor power</line>
      <line>To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds.</line>
      <line>For hours I sat and stared. Assunta’s awe</line>
      <line>And my poor father’s melancholy eyes</line>
      <line>Still pointed that way. That way went my thoughts</line>
      <line>When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew</line>
      <line>In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,</line>
      <line>Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed,</line>
      <line>Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful,</line>
      <line>Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque,</line>
      <line>With still that face . . . which did not therefore change,</line>
      <line>But kept the mystic level of all forms,</line>
      <line>Hates, fears, and admirations, was by turns</line>
      <line>Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite,</line>
      <line>A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,</line>
      <line>A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,</line>
      <line>A still Medusa with mild milky brows</line>
      <line>All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes</line>
      <line>Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or anon</line>
      <line>Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords</line>
      <line>Where the Babe sucked; or Lamia in her first</line>
      <line>Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked</line>
      <line>And shuddering wriggled down to the unclean;</line>
      <line>Or my own mother, leaving her last smile</line>
      <line>In her last kiss upon the baby-mouth</line>
      <line>My father pushed down on the bed for that,—</line>
      <line>Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss,</line>
      <line>Buried at Florence. All which images,</line>
      <line>Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves</line>
      <line>Before my meditative childhood, as</line>
      <line>The incoherencies of change and death</line>
      <line>Are represented fully, mixed and merged,</line>
      <line>In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.</line>
      <line>And while I stared away my childish wits</line>
      <line>Upon my mother’s picture (ah, poor child!),</line>
      <line>My father, who through love had suddenly</line>
      <line>Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose</line>
      <line>From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,</line>
      <line>Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk</line>
      <line>Or grow anew familiar with the sun,—</line>
      <line>Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,</line>
      <line>But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,</line>
      <line>Whom love had unmade from a common man</line>
      <line>But not completed to an uncommon man,—</line>
      <line>My father taught me what he had learnt the best</line>
      <line>Before he died and left me,—grief and love.</line>
      <line>And, seeing we had books among the hills,</line>
      <line>Strong words of counselling souls confederate</line>
      <line>With vocal pines and waters,—out of books</line>
      <line>He taught me all the ignorance of men,</line>
      <line>And how God laughs in heaven when any man</line>
      <line>Says ‘Here I’m learned; this, I understand;</line>
      <line>In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.’</line>
      <line>He sent the schools to school, demonstrating</line>
      <line>A fool will pass for such through one mistake,</line>
      <line>While a philosopher will pass for such,</line>
      <line>Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross</line>
      <line>And heaped up to a system.</line>
      <line>I am like,</line>
      <line>They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows</line>
      <line>Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth</line>
      <line>Of delicate features,—paler, near as grave;</line>
      <line>But then my mother’s smile breaks up the whole,</line>
      <line>And makes it better sometimes than itself.</line>
      <line>So, nine full years, our days were hid with God</line>
      <line>Among his mountains: I was just thirteen,</line>
      <line>Still growing like the plants from unseen roots</line>
      <line>In tongue-tied Springs,—and suddenly awoke</line>
      <line>To full life and life’s needs and agonies</line>
      <line>With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside</line>
      <line>A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,</line>
      <line>Makes awful lightning. His last word was ‘Love—’</line>
      <line>‘Love, my child, love, love!’—(then he had done with grief)</line>
      <line>‘Love, my child.’ Ere I answered he was gone,</line>
      <line>And none was left to love in all the world.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There, ended childhood. What succeeded next</line>
      <line>I recollect as, after fevers, men</line>
      <line>Thread back the passage of delirium,</line>
      <line>Missing the turn still, baffled by the door;</line>
      <line>Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives,</line>
      <line>A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i’ the flank</line>
      <line>With flame, that it should eat and end itself</line>
      <line>Like some tormented scorpion. Then at last</line>
      <line>I do remember clearly how there came</line>
      <line>A stranger with authority, not right</line>
      <line>(I thought not), who commanded, caught me up</line>
      <line>From old Assunta’s neck; how, with a shriek,</line>
      <line>She let me go,—while I, with ears too full</line>
      <line>Of my father’s silence to shriek back a word,</line>
      <line>In all a child’s astonishment at grief</line>
      <line>Stared at the wharf-edge where she stood and moaned,</line>
      <line>My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned!</line>
      <line>The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,</line>
      <line>Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,</line>
      <line>Like one in anger drawing back her skirts</line>
      <line>Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea</line>
      <line>Inexorably pushed between us both</line>
      <line>And, sweeping up the ship with my despair,</line>
      <line>Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep;</line>
      <line>Ten nights and days without the common face</line>
      <line>Of any day or night; the moon and sun</line>
      <line>Cut off from the green reconciling earth,</line>
      <line>To starve into a blind ferocity</line>
      <line>And glare unnatural; the very sky</line>
      <line>(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea,</line>
      <line>As if no human heart should ’scape alive)</line>
      <line>Bedraggled with the desolating salt,</line>
      <line>Until it seemed no more that holy heaven</line>
      <line>To which my father went. All new and strange;</line>
      <line>The universe turned stranger, for a child.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, land!—then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs</line>
      <line>Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home</line>
      <line>Among those mean red houses through the fog?</line>
      <line>And when I heard my father’s language first</line>
      <line>From alien lips which had no kiss for mine</line>
      <line>I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,</line>
      <line>And some one near me said the child was mad</line>
      <line>Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on:</line>
      <line>Was this my father’s England? the great isle?</line>
      <line>The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship</line>
      <line>Of verdure, field from field, as man from man;</line>
      <line>The skies themselves looked low and positive,</line>
      <line>As almost you could touch them with a hand,</line>
      <line>And dared to do it they were so far off</line>
      <line>From God’s celestial crystals; all things blurred</line>
      <line>And dull and vague. Did Shakespeare and his mates</line>
      <line>Absorb the light here?—not a hill or stone</line>
      <line>With heart to strike a radiant colour up</line>
      <line>Or active outline on the indifferent air.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I think I see my father’s sister stand</line>
      <line>Upon the hall-step of her country-house</line>
      <line>To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,</line>
      <line>Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight</line>
      <line>As if for taming accidental thoughts</line>
      <line>From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with gray</line>
      <line>By frigid use of life (she was not old,</line>
      <line>Although my father’s elder by a year),</line>
      <line>A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;</line>
      <line>A close mild mouth, a little soured about</line>
      <line>The ends, through speaking unrequited loves</line>
      <line>Or peradventure niggardly half-truths;</line>
      <line>Eyes of no colour,—once they might have smiled,</line>
      <line>But never, never have forgot themselves</line>
      <line>In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose</line>
      <line>Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,</line>
      <line>Kept more for ruth than pleasure,—if past bloom,</line>
      <line>Past fading also.</line>
      <line>She had lived, we’ll say,</line>
      <line>A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,</line>
      <line>A quiet life, which was not life at all</line>
      <line>(But that, she had not lived enough to know),</line>
      <line>Between the vicar and the county squires,</line>
      <line>The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes</line>
      <line>From the empyrean to assure their souls</line>
      <line>Against chance vulgarisms, and, in the abyss,</line>
      <line>The apothecary, looked on once a year</line>
      <line>To prove their soundness of humility.</line>
      <line>The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts</line>
      <line>Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,</line>
      <line>Because we are of one flesh, after all,</line>
      <line>And need one flannel (with a proper sense</line>
      <line>Of difference in the quality)—and still</line>
      <line>The book-club, guarded from your modern trick</line>
      <line>Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,</line>
      <line>Preserved her intellectual. She had lived</line>
      <line>A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,</line>
      <line>Accounting that to leap from perch to perch</line>
      <line>Was act and joy enough for any bird.</line>
      <line>Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live</line>
      <line>In thickets, and eat berries!</line>
      <line>I, alas,</line>
      <line>A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,</line>
      <line>And she was there to meet me. Very kind.</line>
      <line>Bring the clean water, give out the fresh seed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She stood upon the steps to welcome me,</line>
      <line>Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck,—</line>
      <line>Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool</line>
      <line>To draw the new light closer, catch and cling</line>
      <line>Less blindly. In my ears my father’s word</line>
      <line>Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,</line>
      <line>‘Love, love, my child.’ She, black there with my grief,</line>
      <line>Might feel my love—she was his sister once—</line>
      <line>I clung to her. A moment she seemed moved,</line>
      <line>Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,</line>
      <line>And drew me feebly through the hall into</line>
      <line>The room she sat in.</line>
      <line>There, with some strange spasm</line>
      <line>Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands</line>
      <line>Imperiously, and held me at arm’s length,</line>
      <line>And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes</line>
      <line>Searched through my face,—ay, stabbed it through and through,</line>
      <line>Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find</line>
      <line>A wicked murderer in my innocent face,</line>
      <line>If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,</line>
      <line>She struggled for her ordinary calm—</line>
      <line>And missed it rather,—told me not to shrink,</line>
      <line>As if she had told me not to lie or swear,—</line>
      <line>‘She loved my father and would love me too</line>
      <line>As long as I deserved it.’ Very kind.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I understood her meaning afterward;</line>
      <line>She thought to find my mother in my face,</line>
      <line>And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt,</line>
      <line>Had loved my father truly, as she could,</line>
      <line>And hated, with the gall of gentle souls,</line>
      <line>My Tuscan mother who had fooled away</line>
      <line>A wise man from wise courses, a good man</line>
      <line>From obvious duties, and, depriving her,</line>
      <line>His sister, of the household precedence,</line>
      <line>Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land,</line>
      <line>And made him mad, alike by life and death,</line>
      <line>In love and sorrow. She had pored for years</line>
      <line>What sort of woman could be suitable</line>
      <line>To her sort of hate, to entertain it with,</line>
      <line>And so, her very curiosity</line>
      <line>Became hate too, and all the idealism</line>
      <line>She ever used in life was used for hate,</line>
      <line>Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last</line>
      <line>The love from which it grew, in strength and heat,</line>
      <line>And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense</line>
      <line>Of disputable virtue (say not, sin)</line>
      <line>When Christian doctrine was enforced at church.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And thus my father’s sister was to me</line>
      <line>My mother’s hater. From that day she did</line>
      <line>Her duty to me (I appreciate it</line>
      <line>In her own word as spoken to herself),</line>
      <line>Her duty, in large measure, well pressed out</line>
      <line>But measured always. She was generous, bland,</line>
      <line>More courteous than was tender, gave me still</line>
      <line>The first place,—as if fearful that God’s saints</line>
      <line>Would look down suddenly and say ‘Herein</line>
      <line>You missed a point, I think, through lack of love.’</line>
      <line>Alas, a mother never is afraid</line>
      <line>Of speaking angerly to any child,</line>
      <line>Since love, she knows, is justified of love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I, I was a good child on the whole,</line>
      <line>A meek and manageable child. Why not?</line>
      <line>I did not live, to have the faults of life:</line>
      <line>There seemed more true life in my father’s grave</line>
      <line>Than in all England. Since that threw me off</line>
      <line>Who fain would cleave (his latest will, they say,</line>
      <line>Consigned me to his land), I only thought</line>
      <line>Of lying quiet there where I was thrown</line>
      <line>Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffering her</line>
      <line>To prick me to a pattern with her pin,</line>
      <line>Fibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf,</line>
      <line>And dry out from my drowned anatomy</line>
      <line>The last sea-salt left in me.</line>
      <line>So it was.</line>
      <line>I broke the copious curls upon my head</line>
      <line>In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair.</line>
      <line>I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words</line>
      <line>Which still at any stirring of the heart</line>
      <line>Came up to float across the English phrase</line>
      <line>As lilies {Bene or Che che), because</line>
      <line>She liked my father’s child to speak his tongue.</line>
      <line>I learnt the collects and the cathecism,</line>
      <line>The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice,</line>
      <line>The Articles, the Tracts against the times</line>
      <line>(By no means Buonaventure’s ‘Prick of Love’),</line>
      <line>And various popular synopses of</line>
      <line>Inhuman doctrines never taught by John,</line>
      <line>Because she liked instructed piety.</line>
      <line>I learnt my complement of classic French</line>
      <line>(Kept pure of Balzac and neologism)</line>
      <line>And German also, since she liked a range</line>
      <line>Of liberal education,—tongues, not books.</line>
      <line>I learnt a little algebra, a little</line>
      <line>Of the mathematics,—brushed with extreme flounce</line>
      <line>The circle of the sciences, because</line>
      <line>She misliked women who are frivolous.</line>
      <line>I learnt the royal genealogies</line>
      <line>Of Oviedo, the internal laws</line>
      <line>Of the Burmese empire,—by how many feet</line>
      <line>Mount Chimborazo outsoars Teneriffe.</line>
      <line>What navigable river joins itself</line>
      <line>To Lara, and what census of the year five</line>
      <line>Was taken at Klagenfurt,—because she liked</line>
      <line>A general insight into useful facts.</line>
      <line>I learnt much music,—such as would have been</line>
      <line>As quite impossible in Johnson’s day</line>
      <line>As still it might be wished—fine sleights of hand</line>
      <line>And unimagined fingering, shuffling off</line>
      <line>The hearer’s soul through hurricanes of notes</line>
      <line>To a noisy Tophet; and I drew ... costumes</line>
      <line>From French engravings, nereids neatly draped</line>
      <line>(With smirks of simmering godship): I washed in</line>
      <line>Landscapes from nature (rather say, washed out).</line>
      <line>I danced the polka and Cellarius,</line>
      <line>Spun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax,</line>
      <line>Because she liked accomplishments in girls.</line>
      <line>I read a score of books on womanhood</line>
      <line>To prove, if women do not think at all,</line>
      <line>They may teach thinking (to a maiden aunt</line>
      <line>Or else the author),—books that boldly assert</line>
      <line>Their right of comprehending husband’s talk</line>
      <line>When not too deep, and even of answering</line>
      <line>With pretty ‘may it please you,’ or ‘so it is,’—</line>
      <line>Their rapid insight and fine aptitude,</line>
      <line>Particular worth and general missionariness,</line>
      <line>As long as they keep quiet by the fire</line>
      <line>And never say ‘no’ when the world says ‘ay’,</line>
      <line>For that is fatal,—their angelic reach</line>
      <line>Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn,</line>
      <line>And fatten household sinners,—their, in brief,</line>
      <line>Potential faculty in everything</line>
      <line>Of abdicating power in it: she owned</line>
      <line>She liked a woman to be womanly,</line>
      <line>And English women, she thanked God and sighed</line>
      <line>(Some people always sigh in thanking God)</line>
      <line>Were models to the universe. And last</line>
      <line>I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like</line>
      <line>To see me wear the night with empty hands</line>
      <line>A-doing nothing. So, my shepherdess</line>
      <line>Was something after all (the pastoral saints</line>
      <line>Be praised for’t), leaning lovelorn with pink eyes</line>
      <line>To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks;</line>
      <line>Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat</line>
      <line>So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell</line>
      <line>Which slew the tragic poet.</line>
      <line>By the way,</line>
      <line>The works of women are symbolical.</line>
      <line>We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight,</line>
      <line>Producing what? A pair of slippers, sir,</line>
      <line>To put on when you’re weary—or a stool</line>
      <line>To stumble over and vex you .. . ‘curse that stool!’</line>
      <line>Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean</line>
      <line>And sleep, and dream of something we are not</line>
      <line>But would be for your sake. Alas, alas!</line>
      <line>This hurts most, this—that, after all, we are paid</line>
      <line>The worth of our work, perhaps.</line>
      <line>In looking down</line>
      <line>Those years of education (to return)</line>
      <line>I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more</line>
      <line>In the water-torture . . . flood succeeding flood</line>
      <line>To drench the incapable throat and split the veins . . .</line>
      <line>Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls</line>
      <line>Go out in such a process; many pine</line>
      <line>To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured:</line>
      <line>I had relations in the Unseen, and drew</line>
      <line>The elemental nutriment and heat</line>
      <line>From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights,</line>
      <line>Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark.</line>
      <line>I kept the life thrust on me, on the outside</line>
      <line>Of the inner life with all its ample room</line>
      <line>For heart and lungs, for will and intellect,</line>
      <line>Inviolable by conventions. God,</line>
      <line>I thank thee for that grace of thine!</line>
      <line>At first</line>
      <line>I felt no life which was not patience,—did</line>
      <line>The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing</line>
      <line>Beyond it, sat in just the chair she placed,</line>
      <line>With back against the window, to exclude</line>
      <line>The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,</line>
      <line>Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods</line>
      <line>To bring the house a message,—ay, and walked</line>
      <line>Demurely in her carpeted low rooms,</line>
      <line>As if I should not, hearkening my own steps,</line>
      <line>Misdoubt I was alive. I read her books,</line>
      <line>Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh,</line>
      <line>Gave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors,</line>
      <line>And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup</line>
      <line>(I blushed for joy at that),—‘The Italian child,</line>
      <line>For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways,</line>
      <line>Thrives ill in England: she is paler yet</line>
      <line>Than when we came the last time; she will die.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Will die.’ My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too,</line>
      <line>With sudden anger, and approaching me</line>
      <line>Said low between his teeth, ‘You’re wicked now?</line>
      <line>You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk</line>
      <line>For others, with your naughty light blown out?’</line>
      <line>I looked into his face defyingly;</line>
      <line>He might have known that, being what I was,</line>
      <line>’Twas natural to like to get away</line>
      <line>As far as dead folk can: and then indeed</line>
      <line>Some people make no trouble when they die.</line>
      <line>He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door,</line>
      <line>And shut his dog out.</line>
      <line>Romney, Romney Leigh.</line>
      <line>I have not named my cousin hitherto,</line>
      <line>And yet I used him as a sort of friend;</line>
      <line>My elder by few years, but cold and shy</line>
      <line>And absent . .. tender, when he thought of it,</line>
      <line>Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes,</line>
      <line>As well as early master of Leigh Hall,</line>
      <line>Whereof the nightmare sat upon his youth,</line>
      <line>Repressing all its seasonable delights,</line>
      <line>And agonising with a ghastly sense</line>
      <line>Of universal hideous want and wrong</line>
      <line>To incriminate possession. When he came</line>
      <line>From college to the country, very oft</line>
      <line>He crossed the hill on visits to my aunt,</line>
      <line>With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses,</line>
      <line>A book in one hand,—mere statistics (if</line>
      <line>I chanced to lift the cover), count of all</line>
      <line>The goats whose beards grow sprouting down toward hell</line>
      <line>Against God’s separative judgment-hour.</line>
      <line>And she, she almost loved him,—even allowed</line>
      <line>That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way;</line>
      <line>It made him easier to be pitiful,</line>
      <line>And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed,</line>
      <line>At whiles she let him shut my music up</line>
      <line>And push my needles down, and lead me out</line>
      <line>To see in that south angle of the house</line>
      <line>The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock,</line>
      <line>On some light pretext. She would turn her head</line>
      <line>At other moments, go to fetch a thing,</line>
      <line>And leave me breath enough to speak with him,</line>
      <line>For his sake; it was simple.</line>
      <line>Sometimes too</line>
      <line>He would have saved me utterly, it seemed,</line>
      <line>He stood and looked so.</line>
      <line>Once, he stood so near,</line>
      <line>He dropped a sudden hand upon my head</line>
      <line>Bent down on woman’s work, as soft as rain—</line>
      <line>But then I rose and shook it off as fire,</line>
      <line>The stranger’s touch that took my father’s place</line>
      <line>Yet dared seem soft.</line>
      <line>I used him for a friend</line>
      <line>Before I ever knew him for a friend.</line>
      <line>’Twas better, ’twas worse also, afterward:</line>
      <line>We came so close, we saw our differences</line>
      <line>Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh</line>
      <line>Was looking for the worms, I for the gods.</line>
      <line>A godlike nature his; the gods look down,</line>
      <line>Incurious of themselves; and certainly</line>
      <line>’Tis well I should remember, how, those days,</line>
      <line>I was a worm too, and he looked on me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A little by his act perhaps, yet more</line>
      <line>By something in me, surely not my will,</line>
      <line>I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon,</line>
      <line>To whom life creeps back in the form of death,</line>
      <line>With a sense of separation, a blind pain</line>
      <line>Of blank obstruction, and a roar i’ the ears</line>
      <line>Of visionary chariots which retreat</line>
      <line>As earth grows clearer . . . slowly, by degrees;</line>
      <line>I woke, rose up . . . where was I? in the world;</line>
      <line>For uses therefore I must count worth while.</line>

    <title>My Last Duchess</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>That’s my last Duchess painted on the wall,</line>
      <line>Looking as if she were alive. I call</line>
      <line>That piece a wonder, now: Fra Pandolf’s hands</line>
      <line>Worked busily a day, and there she stands.</line>
      <line>Will’t please you sit and look at her? I said</line>
      <line>‘Fra Pandolf by design, for never read</line>
      <line>Strangers like you that pictured countenance,</line>
      <line>The depth and passion of its earnest glance,</line>
      <line>But to myself they turned (since none puts by</line>
      <line>The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)</line>
      <line>And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,</line>
      <line>How such a glance came there; so, not the first</line>
      <line>Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, ’t was not</line>
      <line>Her husband’s presence only, called that spot</line>
      <line>Of joy into the Duchess’ cheek: perhaps</line>
      <line>Fra Pandolf chanced to say ‘Her mantle laps</line>
      <line>‘Over my lady’s wrist too much,’ or ‘Paint</line>
      <line>‘Must never hope to reproduce the faint</line>
      <line>‘Half-flush that dies along her throat:’ such stuff</line>
      <line>Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough</line>
      <line>For calling up that spot of joy. She had</line>
      <line>A heart—how shall I say?—too soon made glad,</line>
      <line>Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er</line>
      <line>She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.</line>
      <line>Sir, ’t was all one! My favour at her breast,</line>
      <line>The dropping of the daylight in the West,</line>
      <line>The bough of cherries some officious fool</line>
      <line>Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule</line>
      <line>She rode with round the terrace—all and each</line>
      <line>Would draw from her alike the approving speech,</line>
      <line>Or blush, at least. She thanked men,—good! but thanked</line>
      <line>Somehow—I know not how—as if she ranked</line>
      <line>My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</line>
      <line>With anybody’s gift. Who’d stoop to blame</line>
      <line>This sort of trifling? Even had you skill</line>
      <line>In speech—(which I have not)—to make your will</line>
      <line>Quite clear to such an one, and say, ‘Just this</line>
      <line>‘Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,</line>
      <line>‘Or there exceed the mark’—and if she let</line>
      <line>Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set</line>
      <line>Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,</line>
      <line>—E’en then would be some stooping; and I choose</line>
      <line>Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,</line>
      <line>Whene’er I passed her; but who passed without</line>
      <line>Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;</line>
      <line>Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands</line>
      <line>As if alive. Will’t please you rise? We’ll meet</line>
      <line>The company below, then. I repeat,</line>
      <line>The Count your master’s known munificence</line>
      <line>Is ample warrant that no just pretence</line>
      <line>Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;</line>
      <line>Though his fair daughter’s self, as I avowed</line>
      <line>At starting, is my object. Nay, we’ll go</line>
      <line>Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,</line>
      <line>Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,</line>
      <line>Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!</line>

    <title>The Bishop Orders His Tomb at Saint Praxed’s Church</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Vanity, saith the preacher, vanity!</line>
      <line>Draw round my bed: is Anselm keeping back?</line>
      <line>Nephews—sons mine ... ah God, I know not! Well—</line>
      <line>She, men would have to be your mother once,</line>
      <line>Old Gandolf envied me, so fair she was!</line>
      <line>What’s done is done, and she is dead beside,</line>
      <line>Dead long ago, and I am Bishop since,</line>
      <line>And as she died so must we die ourselves,</line>
      <line>And thence ye may perceive the world’s a dream.</line>
      <line>Life, how and what is it? As here I lie</line>
      <line>In this state-chamber, dying by degrees,</line>
      <line>Hours and long hours in the dead night, I ask</line>
      <line>‘Do I live, am I dead?’ Peace, peace seems all.</line>
      <line>Saint Praxed’s ever was the church for peace;</line>
      <line>And so, about this tomb of mine. I fought</line>
      <line>With tooth and nail to save my niche, ye know:</line>
      <line>—Old Gandolf cozened me, despite my care;</line>
      <line>Shrewd was that snatch from out the corner South</line>
      <line>He graced his carrion with, God curse the same!</line>
      <line>Yet still my niche is not so cramped but thence</line>
      <line>One sees the pulpit o’ the epistle-side,</line>
      <line>And somewhat of the choir, those silent seats,</line>
      <line>And up into the aery dome where live</line>
      <line>The angels, and a sunbeam’s sure to lurk:</line>
      <line>And I shall fill my slab of basalt there,</line>
      <line>And ’neath my tabernacle take my rest,</line>
      <line>With those nine columns round me, two and two,</line>
      <line>The odd one at my feet where Anselm stands:</line>
      <line>Peach-blossom marble all, the rare, the ripe</line>
      <line>As fresh-poured red wine of a mighty pulse.</line>
      <line>—Old Gandolf with his paltry onion-stone,</line>
      <line>Put me where I may look at him! True peach,</line>
      <line>Rosy and flawless: how I earned the prize!</line>
      <line>Draw close: that conflagration of my church</line>
      <line>—What then? So much was saved if aught were missed!</line>
      <line>My sons, ye would not be my death? Go dig</line>
      <line>The white-grape vineyard where the oil-press stood,</line>
      <line>Drop water gently till the surface sink,</line>
      <line>And if ye find ... Ah God, I know not, I! ...</line>
      <line>Bedded in store of rotten fig-leaves soft,</line>
      <line>And corded up in a tight olive-frail,</line>
      <line>Some lump, ah God, of lapis lazuli,</line>
      <line>Big as a Jew’s head cut off at the nape,</line>
      <line>Blue as a vein o’er the Madonna’s breast . ..</line>
      <line>Sons, all have I bequeathed you, villas, all,</line>
      <line>That brave Frascati villa with its bath,</line>
      <line>So, let the blue lump poise between my knees,</line>
      <line>Like God the Father’s globe on both his hands</line>
      <line>Ye worship in the Jesu Church so gay,</line>
      <line>For Gandolf shall not choose but see and burst!</line>
      <line>Swift as a weaver’s shuttle fleet our years:</line>
      <line>Man goeth to the grave, and where is he?</line>
      <line>Did I say basalt for my slab, sons? Black—</line>
      <line>’T was ever antique-black I meant! How else</line>
      <line>Shall ye contrast my frieze to come beneath?</line>
      <line>The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,</line>
      <line>Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance</line>
      <line>Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,</line>
      <line>The Saviour at his sermon on the mount,</line>
      <line>Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan</line>
      <line>Ready to twitch the Nymph’s last garment off,</line>
      <line>And Moses with the tables . . . but I know</line>
      <line>Ye mark me not! What do they whisper thee,</line>
      <line>Child of my bowels, Anselm? Ah, ye hope</line>
      <line>To revel down my villas while I gasp</line>
      <line>Bricked o’er with beggar’s mouldy travertine</line>
      <line>Which Gandolf from his tomb-top chuckles at!</line>
      <line>Nay, boys, ye love me—all of jasper, then!</line>
      <line>’T is jasper ye stand pledged to, lest I grieve.</line>
      <line>My bath must needs be left behind, alas!</line>
      <line>One block, pure green as a pistachio-nut,</line>
      <line>There’s plenty jasper somewhere in the world—</line>
      <line>And have I not Saint Praxed’s ear to pray</line>
      <line>Horses for ye, and brown Greek manuscripts,</line>
      <line>And mistresses with great smooth marbly limbs?</line>
      <line>—That’s if ye carve my epitaph aright,</line>
      <line>Choice Latin, picked phrase, Tully’s every word,</line>
      <line>No gaudy ware like Gandolf s second line—</line>
      <line>Tully, my masters? Ulpian serves his need!</line>
      <line>And then how I shall lie through centuries,</line>
      <line>And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,</line>
      <line>And see God made and eaten all day long,</line>
      <line>And feel the steady candle-flame, and taste</line>
      <line>Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!</line>
      <line>For as I lie here, hours of the dead night,</line>
      <line>Dying in state and by such slow degrees,</line>
      <line>I fold my arms as if they clasped a crook,</line>
      <line>And stretch my feet forth straight as stone can point,</line>
      <line>And let the bedclothes, for a mortcloth, drop</line>
      <line>Into great laps and folds of sculptor’s-work:</line>
      <line>And as yon tapers dwindle, and strange thoughts</line>
      <line>Grow, with a certain humming in my ears,</line>
      <line>About the life before I lived this life,</line>
      <line>And this life too, popes, cardinals and priests,</line>
      <line>Saint Praxed at his sermon on the mount,</line>
      <line>Your tall pale mother with her talking eyes,</line>
      <line>And new-found agate urns as fresh as day,</line>
      <line>And marble’s language, Latin pure, discreet,</line>
      <line>—Aha, elucescebat quoth our friend?</line>
      <line>No Tully, said I, Ulpian at the best!</line>
      <line>Evil and brief hath been my pilgrimage.</line>
      <line>All lapis, all, sons! Else I give the Pope</line>
      <line>My villas! Will ye ever eat my heart?</line>
      <line>Ever your eyes were as a lizard’s quick,</line>
      <line>They glitter like your mother’s for my soul,</line>
      <line>Or ye would heighten my impoverished frieze,</line>
      <line>Piece out its starved design, and fill my vase</line>
      <line>With grapes, and add a vizor and a Term,</line>
      <line>And to the tripod ye would tie a lynx</line>
      <line>That in his struggle throws the thyrsus down,</line>
      <line>To comfort me on my entablature</line>
      <line>Whereon I am to lie till I must ask</line>
      <line>‘Do I live, am I dead?’ There, leave me, there!</line>
      <line>For ye have stabbed me with ingratitude</line>
      <line>To death—ye wish it—God, ye wish it! Stone—</line>
      <line>Gritstone, a-crumble! Clammy squares which sweat</line>
      <line>As if the corpse they keep were oozing through—</line>
      <line>And no more lapis to delight the world!</line>
      <line>Well go! I bless ye. Fewer tapers there,</line>
      <line>But in a row: and, going, turn your backs</line>
      <line>—Ay, like departing altar-ministrants,</line>
      <line>And leave me in my church, the church for peace,</line>
      <line>That I may watch at leisure if he leers—</line>
      <line>Old Gandolf, at me, from his onion-stone,</line>
      <line>As still he envied me, so fair she was!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, to be in England,</line>
      <line>Now that April’s there,</line>
      <line>And whoever wakes in England</line>
      <line>Sees, some morning, unaware,</line>
      <line>That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf</line>
      <line>Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,</line>
      <line>While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</line>
      <line>In England—now!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And after April, when May follows,</line>
      <line>And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!</line>
      <line>Hark, where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge</line>
      <line>Leans to the field and scatters on the clover</line>
      <line>Blossoms and dewdrops—at the bent spray’s edge—</line>
      <line>That’s the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,</line>
      <line>Lest you should think he never could recapture</line>
      <line>The first fine careless rapture!</line>
      <line>And though the fields look rough with hoary dew</line>
      <line>All will be gay when noontide wakes anew</line>
      <line>The buttercups, the little children’s dower</line>
      <line>—Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!</line>

      <line>But do not let us quarrel any more,</line>
      <line>No, my Lucrezia; bear with me for once:</line>
      <line>Sit down and all shall happen as you wish.</line>
      <line>You turn your face, but does it bring your heart?</line>
      <line>I’ll work then for your friend’s friend, never fear,</line>
      <line>Treat his own subject after his own way,</line>
      <line>Fix his own time, accept too his own price,</line>
      <line>And shut the money into this small hand</line>
      <line>When next it takes mine. Will it? tenderly?</line>
      <line>Oh, I’ll content him,—but to-morrow, Love!</line>
      <line>I often am much wearier than you think,</line>
      <line>This evening more than usual, and it seems</line>
      <line>As if—forgive now—should you let me sit</line>
      <line>Here by the window with your hand in mine</line>
      <line>And look a half-hour forth on Fiesole,</line>
      <line>Both of one mind, as married people use,</line>
      <line>Quietly, quietly the evening through,</line>
      <line>I might get up to-morrow to my work</line>
      <line>Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us try.</line>
      <line>To-morrow, how you shall be glad for this!</line>
      <line>Your soft hand is a woman of itself,</line>
      <line>And mine the man’s bared breast she curls inside.</line>
      <line>Don’t count the time lost, neither; you must serve</line>
      <line>For each of the five pictures we require:</line>
      <line>It saves a model. So! keep looking so—</line>
      <line>My serpentining beauty, rounds on rounds!</line>
      <line>—How could you ever prick those perfect ears,</line>
      <line>Even to put the pearl there! oh, so sweet—</line>
      <line>My face, my moon, my everybody’s moon,</line>
      <line>Which everybody looks on and calls his,</line>
      <line>And, I suppose, is looked on by in turn,</line>
      <line>While she looks—no one’s: very dear, no less.</line>
      <line>You smile? why, there’s my picture ready made,</line>
      <line>There’s what we painters call our harmony!</line>
      <line>A common greyness silvers everything,—</line>
      <line>All in a twilight, you and I alike</line>
      <line>—You, at the point of your first pride in me</line>
      <line>(That’s gone you know),—but I, at every point;</line>
      <line>My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down</line>
      <line>To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.</line>
      <line>There’s the bell clinking from the chapel-top;</line>
      <line>That length of convent-wall across the way</line>
      <line>Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;</line>
      <line>The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,</line>
      <line>And autumn grows, autumn in everything.</line>
      <line>Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape</line>
      <line>As if I saw alike my work and self</line>
      <line>And all that I was born to be and do,</line>
      <line>A twilight-piece. Love, we are in God’s hand.</line>
      <line>How strange now, looks the life he makes us lead;</line>
      <line>So free we seem, so fettered fast we are!</line>
      <line>I feel he laid the fetter: let it lie!</line>
      <line>This chamber for example—turn your head—</line>
      <line>All that’s behind us! You don’t understand</line>
      <line>Nor care to understand about my art,</line>
      <line>But you can hear at least when people speak:</line>
      <line>And that cartoon, the second from the door</line>
      <line>—It is the thing, Love! so such things should be—</line>
      <line>Behold Madonna!—I am bold to say.</line>
      <line>1 can do with my pencil what I know,</line>
      <line>What I see, what at bottom of my heart</line>
      <line>I wish for, if I ever wish so deep—</line>
      <line>Do easily, too—what I say, perfectly,</line>
      <line>I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are judge,</line>
      <line>Who listened to the Legate’s talk last week,</line>
      <line>And just as much they used to say in France.</line>
      <line>At any rate’t is easy, all of it!</line>
      <line>No sketches first, no studies, that’s long past:</line>
      <line>I do what many dream of, all their lives,</line>
      <line>—Dream? strive to do, and agonize to do,</line>
      <line>And fail in doing. I could count twenty such</line>
      <line>On twice your fingers, and not leave this town,</line>
      <line>Who strive—you don’t know how the others strive</line>
      <line>To paint a little thing like that you smeared</line>
      <line>Carelessly passing with your robes afloat,—</line>
      <line>Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says,</line>
      <line>(I know his name, no matter)—so much less!</line>
      <line>Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.</line>
      <line>There burns a truer light of God in them,</line>
      <line>In their vexed beating stuffed and stopped-up brain,</line>
      <line>Heart, or whate’er else, than goes on to prompt</line>
      <line>This low-pulsed forthright craftsman’s hand of mine.</line>
      <line>Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,</line>
      <line>Reach many a time a heaven that’s shut to me,</line>
      <line>Enter and take their place there sure enough,</line>
      <line>Though they come back and cannot tell the world.</line>
      <line>My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here.</line>
      <line>The sudden blood of these men! at a word—</line>
      <line>Praise them, it boils, or blame them, it boils too.</line>
      <line>I, painting from myself and to myself,</line>
      <line>Know what I do, am unmoved by men’s blame</line>
      <line>Or their praise either. Somebody remarks</line>
      <line>Morello’s outline there is wrongly traced,</line>
      <line>His hue mistaken; what of that? or else,</line>
      <line>Rightly traced and well ordered; what of that?</line>
      <line>Speak as they please, what does the mountain care?</line>
      <line>Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp,</line>
      <line>Or what’s a heaven for? All is silver-grey</line>
      <line>Placid and perfect with my art: the worse!</line>
      <line>I know both what I want and what might gain,</line>
      <line>And yet how profitless to know, to sigh</line>
      <line>‘Had I been two, another and myself,</line>
      <line>‘Our head would have o’erlooked the world!’ No doubt.</line>
      <line>Yonder’s a work now, of that famous youth</line>
      <line>The Urbinate who died five years ago.</line>
      <line>(’T is copied, George Vasari sent it me.)</line>
      <line>Well, I can fancy how he did it all,</line>
      <line>Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,</line>
      <line>Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,</line>
      <line>Above and through his art—for it gives way;</line>
      <line>That arm is wrongly put—and there again—</line>
      <line>A fault to pardon in the drawing’s lines,</line>
      <line>Its body, so to speak: its soul is right,</line>
      <line>He means right—that, a child may understand.</line>
      <line>Still, what an arm! and I could alter it:</line>
      <line>But all the play, the insight and the stretch—</line>
      <line>Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out?</line>
      <line>Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul,</line>
      <line>We might have risen to Rafael, I and you!</line>
      <line>Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think—</line>
      <line>More than I merit, yes, by many times.</line>
      <line>But had you—oh, with the same perfect brow,</line>
      <line>And perfect eyes, and more than perfect mouth,</line>
      <line>And the low voice my soul hears, as a bird</line>
      <line>The fowler’s pipe, and follows to the snare—</line>
      <line>Had you, with these the same, but brought a mind!</line>
      <line>Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged</line>
      <line>‘God and the glory! never care for gain.</line>
      <line>‘The present by the future, what is that?</line>
      <line>‘Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!</line>
      <line>‘Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!’</line>
      <line>I might have done it for you. So it seems:</line>
      <line>Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules.</line>
      <line>Beside, incentives come from the soul’s self;</line>
      <line>The rest avail not. Why do I need you?</line>
      <line>What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo?</line>
      <line>In this world, who can do a thing, will not;</line>
      <line>And who would do it, cannot, I perceive:</line>
      <line>Yet the will’s somewhat—somewhat, too, the power—</line>
      <line>And thus we half-men struggle. At the end,</line>
      <line>God, I conclude, compensates, punishes.</line>
      <line>’T is safer for me, if the award be strict,</line>
      <line>That I am something underrated here,</line>
      <line>Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth.</line>
      <line>I dared not, do you know, leave home all day,</line>
      <line>For fear of chancing on the Paris lords.</line>
      <line>The best is when they pass and look aside;</line>
      <line>But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all.</line>
      <line>Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time,</line>
      <line>And that long festal year at Fontainebleau!</line>
      <line>I surely then could sometimes leave the ground,</line>
      <line>Put on the glory, Rafael’s daily wear,</line>
      <line>In that humane great monarch’s golden look,—</line>
      <line>One finger in his beard or twisted curl</line>
      <line>Over his mouth’s good mark that made the smile,</line>
      <line>One arm about my shoulder, round my neck,</line>
      <line>The jingle of his gold chain in my ear,</line>
      <line>I painting proudly with his breath on me,</line>
      <line>All his court round him, seeing with his eyes,</line>
      <line>Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls</line>
      <line>Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts,—</line>
      <line>And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond,</line>
      <line>This in the background, waiting on my work,</line>
      <line>To crown the issue with a last reward!</line>
      <line>A good time, was it not, my kingly days?</line>
      <line>And had you not grown restless . . . but I know—</line>
      <line>’T is done and past; ’t was right, my instinct said;</line>
      <line>Too live the life grew, golden and not grey,</line>
      <line>And I’m the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt</line>
      <line>Out of the grange whose four walls make his world.</line>
      <line>Flow could it end in any other way?</line>
      <line>You called me, and I came home to your heart.</line>
      <line>The triumph was—to reach and stay there; since</line>
      <line>I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost?</line>
      <line>Let my hands frame your face in your hair’s gold,</line>
      <line>You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine!</line>
      <line>‘Rafael did this, Andrea painted that;</line>
      <line>‘The Roman’s is the better when you pray,</line>
      <line>‘But still the other’s Virgin was his wife—’</line>
      <line>Men will excuse me. I am glad to judge</line>
      <line>Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows</line>
      <line>My better fortune, I resolve to think.</line>
      <line>For do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives,</line>
      <line>Said one day Agnolo, his very self,</line>
      <line>To Rafael ... I have known it all these years ...</line>
      <line>(When the young man was flaming out his thoughts</line>
      <line>Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see,</line>
      <line>Too lifted up in heart because of it)</line>
      <line>‘Friend, there’s a certain sorry little scrub</line>
      <line>‘Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,</line>
      <line>‘Who, were he set to plan and execute</line>
      <line>‘As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,</line>
      <line>‘Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!’</line>
      <line>To Rafael’s!—And indeed the arm is wrong.</line>
      <line>I hardly dare ... yet, only you to see,</line>
      <line>Give the chalk here—quick, thus the line should go!</line>
      <line>Ay, but the soul! he’s Rafael! rub it out!</line>
      <line>Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth,</line>
      <line>(What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo?</line>
      <line>Do you forget already words like those?)</line>
      <line>If really there was such a chance, so lost,—</line>
      <line>Is, whether you’re—not grateful—but more pleased.</line>
      <line>Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed!</line>
      <line>This hour has been an hour! Another smile?</line>
      <line>If you would sit thus by me every night</line>
      <line>I should work better, do you comprehend?</line>
      <line>I mean that I should earn more, give you more.</line>
      <line>See, it is settled dusk now; there’s a star;</line>
      <line>Morello’s gone, the watch-lights show the wall,</line>
      <line>The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.</line>
      <line>Come from the window, love,—come in, at last,</line>
      <line>Inside the melancholy little house</line>
      <line>We built to be so gay with. God is just.</line>
      <line>King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights</line>
      <line>When I look up from painting, eyes tired out,</line>
      <line>The walls become illumined, brick from brick</line>
      <line>Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold,</line>
      <line>That gold of his I did cement them with!</line>
      <line>Let us but love each other. Must you go?</line>
      <line>That Cousin here again? he waits outside?</line>
      <line>Must see you—you, and not with me? Those loans?</line>
      <line>More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that?</line>
      <line>Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend?</line>
      <line>While hand and eye and something of a heart</line>
      <line>Are left me, work’s my ware, and what’s it worth?</line>
      <line>I’ll pay my fancy. Only let me sit</line>
      <line>The grey remainder of the evening out,</line>
      <line>Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly</line>
      <line>How I could paint, were I but back in France,</line>
      <line>One picture, just one more—the Virgin’s face,</line>
      <line>Not yours this time! I want you at my side</line>
      <line>To hear them—that is, Michel Agnolo—</line>
      <line>Judge all I do and tell you of its worth.</line>
      <line>Will you? To-morrow, satisfy your friend.</line>
      <line>I take the subjects for his corridor,</line>
      <line>Finish the portrait out of hand—there, there,</line>
      <line>And throw him in another thing or two</line>
      <line>If he demurs; the whole should prove enough</line>
      <line>To pay for this same Cousin’s freak. Beside,</line>
      <line>What’s better and what’s all I care about,</line>
      <line>Get you the thirteen scudi for the ruff!</line>
      <line>Love, does that please you? Ah, but what does he,</line>
      <line>The Cousin! what does he to please you more?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I am grown peaceful as old age to-night.</line>
      <line>I regret little, I would change still less.</line>
      <line>Since there my past life lies, why alter it?</line>
      <line>The very wrong to Francis!—it is true</line>
      <line>I took his coin, was tempted and complied,</line>
      <line>And built this house and sinned, and all is said.</line>
      <line>My father and my mother died of want.</line>
      <line>Well, had I riches of my own? you see</line>
      <line>How one gets rich! Let each one bear his lot.</line>
      <line>They were born poor, lived poor, and poor they died:</line>
      <line>And I have laboured somewhat in my time</line>
      <line>And not been paid profusely. Some good son</line>
      <line>Paint my two hundred pictures—let him try!</line>
      <line>No doubt, there’s something strikes a balance. Yes,</line>
      <line>You loved me quite enough, it seems to-night.</line>
      <line>This must suffice me here. What would one have?</line>
      <line>In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one more chance—</line>
      <line>Four great walls in the New Jerusalem,</line>
      <line>Meted on each side by the angel’s reed,</line>
      <line>For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo and me</line>
      <line>To cover—the three first without a wife,</line>
      <line>While I have mine! So—still they overcome</line>
      <line>Because there’s still Lucrezia,—as I choose.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Again the Cousin’s whistle! Go, my Love.</line>

    <title>Two in the Campagna</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I wonder do you feel to-day</line>
      <line>As I have felt since, hand in hand,</line>
      <line>We sat down on the grass, to stray</line>
      <line>In spirit better through the land,</line>
      <line>This morn of Rome and May?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For me, I touched a thought, I know,</line>
      <line>Has tantalized me many times,</line>
      <line>(Like turns of thread the spiders throw</line>
      <line>Mocking across our path) for rhymes</line>
      <line>To catch at and let go.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Help me to hold it! First it left</line>
      <line>The yellowing fennel, run to seed</line>
      <line>There, branching from the brickwork’s cleft,</line>
      <line>Some old tomb’s ruin: yonder weed</line>
      <line>Took up the floating weft,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Where one small orange cup amassed</line>
      <line>Five beetles,—blind and green they grope</line>
      <line>Among the honey-meal: and last,</line>
      <line>Everywhere on the grassy slope</line>
      <line>I traced it. Hold it fast!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The champaign with its endless fleece</line>
      <line>Of feathery grasses everywhere!</line>
      <line>Silence and passion, joy and peace,</line>
      <line>An everlasting wash of air—</line>
      <line>Rome’s ghost since her decease.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such life here, through such lengths of hours,</line>
      <line>Such miracles performed in play,</line>
      <line>Such primal naked forms of flowers,</line>
      <line>Such letting nature have her way</line>
      <line>While heaven looks from its towers!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How say you? Let us, O my dove,</line>
      <line>Let us be unashamed of soul,</line>
      <line>As earth lies bare to heaven above!</line>
      <line>How is it under our control</line>
      <line>To love or not to love?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I would that you were all to me,</line>
      <line>You that are just so much, no more.</line>
      <line>Nor yours nor mine, nor slave nor free!</line>
      <line>Where does the fault lie? What the core</line>
      <line>O’ the wound, since wound must be?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I would I could adopt your will,</line>
      <line>See with your eyes, and set my heart</line>
      <line>Beating by yours, and drink my fill</line>
      <line>At your soul’s springs,—your part my part</line>
      <line>In life, for good and ill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No. I yearn upward, touch you close,</line>
      <line>Then stand away. I kiss your cheek,</line>
      <line>Catch your soul’s warmth,—I pluck the rose</line>
      <line>And love it more than tongue can speak—</line>
      <line>Then the good minute goes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Already how am I so far</line>
      <line>Out of that minute? Must I go</line>
      <line>Still like the thistle-ball, no bar,</line>
      <line>Onward, whenever light winds blow</line>
      <line>Fixed by no friendly star?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Just when I seemed about to learn!</line>
      <line>Where is the thread now? Off again!</line>
      <line>The old trick! Only I discern—</line>
      <line>Infinite passion, and the pain</line>
      <line>Of finite hearts that yearn.</line>

      <line>Heart, fear nothing, for, heart, thou shalt find her—</line>
      <line>Next time, herself!—not the trouble behind her</line>
      <line>Left in the curtain, the couch’s perfume!</line>

    <title>A Toccata of Galuppi’s</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh Galuppi, Baldassaro, this is very sad to find!</line>
      <line>I can hardly misconceive you; it would prove me deaf and blind;</line>
      <line>But although I take your meaning, ’t is with such a heavy mind!</line>
      <line>Here you come with your old music, and here’s all the good it brings.</line>
      <line>What, they lived once thus at Venice where the merchants were the kings,</line>
      <line>Where Saint Mark’s is, where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ay, because the sea’s the street there; and’t is arched by ... what you call</line>
      <line>. . Shylock’s bridge with houses on it, where they kept the carnival:</line>
      <line>I was never out of England—it’s as if I saw it all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Did young people take their pleasure when the sea was warm in May?</line>
      <line>Balls and masks begun at midnight, burning ever to midday,</line>
      <line>When they made up fresh adventures for the morrow, do you say?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so round and lips so red,—</line>
      <line>On her neck the small face buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed,</line>
      <line>O’er the breast’s superb abundance where a man might base his head?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well, and it was graceful of them—they’d break talk off and afford</line>
      <line>—She, to bite her mask’s black velvet—he, to finger on his sword,</line>
      <line>While you sat and played Toccatas, stately at the clavichord?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What? Those lesser thirds so plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh,</line>
      <line>Told them something? Those suspensions, those solutions—‘Must we die?’</line>
      <line>Those commiserating sevenths—‘Life might last! we can but try!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Were you happy?’—‘Yes’—‘And are you still as happy?’—‘Yes. And you?’</line>
      <line>—‘Then, more kisses!’—‘Did / stop them, when a million seemed so few?’</line>
      <line>Hark, the dominant’s persistence till it must be answered to!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, an octave struck the answer. Oh, they praised you, I dare say!</line>
      <line>‘Brave Galuppi! that was music! good alike at grave and gay!</line>
      <line>‘I can always leave off talking when I hear a master play!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then they left you for their pleasure: till in due time, one by one,</line>
      <line>Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well undone,</line>
      <line>Death stepped tacitly and took them where they never see the sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when I sit down to reason, think to take my stand nor swerve,</line>
      <line>While I triumph o’er a secret wrung from nature’s close reserve,</line>
      <line>In you come with your cold music till I creep thro’ every nerve.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, you, like a ghosdy cricket, creaking where a house was burned:</line>
      <line>‘Dust and ashes, dead and done with, Venice spent what Venice earned.</line>
      <line>‘The soul, doubtless, is immortal—where a soul can be discerned.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Yours for instance: you know physics, something of geology,</line>
      <line>‘Mathematics are your pastime; souls shall rise in their degree;</line>
      <line>‘Butterflies may dread extinction,—you’ll not die, it cannot be!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘As for Venice and her people, merely born to bloom and drop,</line>
      <line>‘Here on earth they bore their fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop:</line>
      <line>‘What of soul was left, I wonder, when the kissing had to stop?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Dust and ashes!’ So you creak it, and I want the heart to scold.</line>
      <line>Dear dead women, with such hair, too—what’s become of all the gold</line>
      <line>Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown old.</line>

      <line>Askance to watch the working of his lie</line>
      <line>On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford</line>

      <line>Into that ominous tract which, all agree,</line>
      <line>Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly</line>
      <line>I did turn as he pointed: neither pride</line>
      <line>Nor hope rekindling at the end descried,</line>
      <line>So much as gladness that some end might be.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,</line>
      <line>What with my search drawn out thro’ years, my hope</line>
      <line>Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope</line>
      <line>With that obstreperous joy success would bring,—</line>
      <line>I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring</line>
      <line>My heart made, finding failure in its scope.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As when a sick man very near to death</line>
      <line>Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end</line>
      <line>The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,</line>
      <line>And hears one bid the other go, draw breath</line>
      <line>Freelier outside, (‘since all is o’er,’ he saith,</line>
      <line>‘And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;’)</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While some discuss if near the other graves</line>
      <line>Be room enough for this, and when a day</line>
      <line>Suits best for carrying the corpse away,</line>
      <line>With care about the banners, scarves and staves:</line>
      <line>And still the man hears all, and only craves</line>
      <line>He may not shame such tender love and stay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,</line>
      <line>Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ</line>
      <line>So many times among ‘The Band’—to wit,</line>
      <line>The knights who to the Dark Tower’s search addressed</line>
      <line>Their steps—that just to fail as they, seemed best,</line>
      <line>And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,</line>
      <line>That hateful cripple, out of his highway</line>
      <line>Into the path he pointed. All the day</line>
      <line>Had been a dreary one at best, and dim</line>
      <line>Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim</line>
      <line>Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For mark! no sooner was I fairly found</line>
      <line>Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,</line>
      <line>Than, pausing to throw backward a last view</line>
      <line>O’er the safe road, ’t was gone; grey plain all round:</line>
      <line>Nothing but plain to the horizon’s bound.</line>
      <line>I might go on; nought else remained to do.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, on I went. I think I never saw</line>
      <line>Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:</line>
      <line>For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!</line>
      <line>But cockle, spurge, according to their law</line>
      <line>Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,</line>
      <line>You’d think; a burr had been a treasure-trove.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No! penury, inertness and grimace,</line>
      <line>In some strange sort, were the land’s portion. ‘See</line>
      <line>‘Or shut your eyes,’ said Nature peevishly,</line>
      <line>‘It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:</line>
      <line>"T is the Last Judgment’s fire must cure this place,</line>
      <line>‘Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk</line>
      <line>Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bents</line>
      <line>Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents</line>
      <line>In the dock’s harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to baulk</line>
      <line>All hope of greenness? ’t is a brute must walk</line>
      <line>Pashing their life out, with a brute’s intents.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair</line>
      <line>In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud</line>
      <line>Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.</line>
      <line>One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,</line>
      <line>Stood stupefied, however he came there:</line>
      <line>Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,</line>
      <line>With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain,</line>
      <line>And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;</line>
      <line>Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;</line>
      <line>I never saw a brute I hated so;</line>
      <line>He must be wicked to deserve such pain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart.</line>
      <line>As a man calls for wine before he fights,</line>
      <line>I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,</line>
      <line>Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.</line>
      <line>Think first, fight afterwards—the soldier’s art:</line>
      <line>One taste of the old time sets all to rights.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not it! I fancied Cuthbert’s reddening face</line>
      <line>Beneath its garniture of curly gold,</line>
      <line>Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold</line>
      <line>An arm in mine to fix me to the place,</line>
      <line>That way he used. Alas, one night’s disgrace!</line>
      <line>Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Giles then, the soul of honour—there he stands</line>
      <line>Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.</line>
      <line>What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.</line>
      <line>Good—but the scene shifts—faugh! what hangman-hands</line>
      <line>Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands</line>
      <line>Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Better this present than a past like that;</line>
      <line>Back therefore to my darkening path again!</line>
      <line>No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.</line>
      <line>Will the night send a howlet or a bat?</line>
      <line>I asked: when something on the dismal flat</line>
      <line>Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A sudden little river crossed my path</line>
      <line>As unexpected as a serpent comes.</line>
      <line>No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;</line>
      <line>This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath</line>
      <line>For the fiend’s glowing hoof—to see the wrath</line>
      <line>Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So petty yet so spiteful! All along,</line>
      <line>Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;</line>
      <line>Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit</line>
      <line>Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:</line>
      <line>The river which had done them all the wrong,</line>
      <line>Whate’er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Which, while I forded,—good saints, how I feared</line>
      <line>To set my foot upon a dead man’s cheek,</line>
      <line>Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek</line>
      <line>For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!</line>
      <line>—It may have been a water-rat I speared,</line>
      <line>But, ugh! it sounded like a baby’s shriek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Glad was I when I reached the other bank.</line>
      <line>Now for a better country. Vain presage!</line>
      <line>Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage,</line>
      <line>Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank</line>
      <line>Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank,</line>
      <line>Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.</line>
      <line>What penned them there, with all the plain to choose?</line>
      <line>No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,</line>
      <line>None out of it. Mad brewage set to work</line>
      <line>Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk</line>
      <line>Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And more than that—a furlong on—why, there!</line>
      <line>What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,</line>
      <line>Or brake, not wheel—that harrow fit to reel</line>
      <line>Men’s bodies out like silk? with all the air</line>
      <line>Of Tophet’s tool, on earth left unaware,</line>
      <line>Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,</line>
      <line>Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth</line>
      <line>Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,</line>
      <line>Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood</line>
      <line>Changes and off he goes!) within a rood—</line>
      <line>Bog, clay and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,</line>
      <line>Now patches where some leanness of the soil’s</line>
      <line>Broke into moss or substances like boils;</line>
      <line>Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him</line>
      <line>Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim</line>
      <line>Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And just as far as ever from the end!</line>
      <line>Nought in the distance but the evening, nought</line>
      <line>To point my footstep further! At the thought,</line>
      <line>A great black bird, Apollyon’s bosom-friend,</line>
      <line>Sailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned</line>
      <line>That brushed my cap—perchance the guide I sought.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,</line>
      <line>’Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place</line>
      <line>All round to mountains—with such name to grace</line>
      <line>Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.</line>
      <line>How thus they had surprised me,—solve it, you!</line>
      <line>How to get from them was no clearer case.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick</line>
      <line>Of mischief happened to me, God knows when—</line>
      <line>In a bad dream perhaps. Here ended, then,</line>
      <line>Progress this way. When, in the very nick</line>
      <line>Of giving up, one time more, came a click</line>
      <line>As when a trap shuts—you’re inside the den!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Burningly it came on me all at once,</line>
      <line>This was the place! those two hills on the right,</line>
      <line>Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in light;</line>
      <line>While to the left, a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce,</line>
      <line>Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,</line>
      <line>After a life spent training for the sight!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?</line>
      <line>The round squat turret, blind as the fool’s heart,</line>
      <line>Built of brown stone, without a counterpart</line>
      <line>In the whole world. The tempest’s mocking elf</line>
      <line>Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf</line>
      <line>He strikes on, only when the timbers start.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not see? because of night perhaps?—why, day</line>
      <line>Came back again for that! before it left,</line>
      <line>The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:</line>
      <line>The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,</line>
      <line>Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,—</line>
      <line>‘Now stab and end the creature—to the heft!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled</line>
      <line>Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears</line>
      <line>Of all the lost adventurers my peers,—</line>
      <line>How such a one was strong, and such was bold,</line>
      <line>And such was fortunate, yet each of old</line>
      <line>Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met</line>
      <line>To view the last of me, a living frame</line>
      <line>For one more picture! in a sheet of flame</line>
      <line>I saw them and I knew them all. And yet</line>
      <line>Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,</line>
      <line>And blew. ‘Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.'</line>

    <title>A Grammarian’s Funeral</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us begin and carry up this corpse,</line>
      <line>Singing together.</line>
      <line>Leave we the common crofts, the vulgar thorpes</line>
      <line>Each in its tether</line>
      <line>Sleeping safe on the bosom of the plain,</line>
      <line>Cared-for till cock-crow:</line>
      <line>Look out if yonder be not day again</line>
      <line>Rimming the rock-row!</line>
      <line>That’s the appropriate country: there, man’s thought,</line>
      <line>Rarer, intenser,</line>
      <line>Self-gathered for an outbreak, as it ought,</line>
      <line>Chafes in the censer.</line>
      <line>Leave we the unlettered plain its herd and crop;</line>
      <line>Seek we sepulture</line>
      <line>On a tall mountain, citied to the top,</line>
      <line>Crowded with culture!</line>
      <line>All the peaks soar, but one the rest excels;</line>
      <line>Clouds overcome it;</line>
      <line>No! yonder sparkle is the citadel’s</line>
      <line>Circling its summit.</line>
      <line>Thither our path lies; wind we up the heights:</line>
      <line>Wait ye the warning?</line>
      <line>Our low life was the level’s and the night’s;</line>
      <line>He’s for the morning.</line>
      <line>Step to a tune, square chests, erect each head,</line>
      <line>’Ware the beholders!</line>
      <line>This is our master, famous calm and dead,</line>
      <line>Borne on our shoulders.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sleep, crop and herd! sleep, darkling thorpe and croft,</line>
      <line>Safe from the weather!</line>
      <line>He, whom we convoy to his grave aloft,</line>
      <line>Singing together,</line>
      <line>He was a man born with thy face and throat,</line>
      <line>Lyric Apollo!</line>
      <line>Long he lived nameless: how should spring take note</line>
      <line>Winter would follow?</line>
      <line>Till lo, the little touch, and youth was gone!</line>
      <line>Cramped and diminished,</line>
      <line>Moaned he, ‘New measures, other feet anon!</line>
      <line>‘My dance is finished?’</line>
      <line>No, that’s the world’s way: (keep the mountain-side,</line>
      <line>Make for the city!)</line>
      <line>He knew the signal, and stepped on with pride</line>
      <line>Over men’s pity;</line>
      <line>Left play for work, and grappled with the world</line>
      <line>Bent on escaping:</line>
      <line>‘What’s in the scroll,’ quoth he, ‘thou keepest furled?</line>
      <line>‘Show me their shaping,</line>
      <line>‘Theirs who most studied man, the bard and sage,—</line>
      <line>‘Give!’—So, he gowned him,</line>
      <line>Straight got by heart that book to its last page:</line>
      <line>Learned, we found him.</line>
      <line>Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes like lead,</line>
      <line>Accents uncertain:</line>
      <line>‘Time to taste life,’ another would have said,</line>
      <line>‘Up with the curtain!’</line>
      <line>This man said rather, ‘Actual life comes next?</line>
      <line>‘Patience a moment!</line>
      <line>‘Grant I have mastered learning’s crabbed text,</line>
      <line>‘Still there’s the comment.</line>
      <line>‘Let me know all! Prate not of most or least,</line>
      <line>‘Painful or easy!</line>
      <line>‘Even to the crumbs I’d fain eat up the feast,</line>
      <line>‘Ay, nor feel queasy.’</line>
      <line>Oh, such a life as he resolved to live,</line>
      <line>When he had learned it,</line>
      <line>When he had gathered all books had to give!</line>
      <line>Sooner, he spurned it.</line>
      <line>Image the whole, then execute the parts—</line>
      <line>Fancy the fabric</line>
      <line>Quite, ere you build, ere steel strike fire from quartz,</line>
      <line>Ere mortar dab brick!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>(Here’s the town-gate reached: there’s the market-place</line>
      <line>Gaping before us.)</line>
      <line>Yea, this in him was the peculiar grace</line>
      <line>(Hearten our chorus!)</line>
      <line>That before living he’d learn how to live—</line>
      <line>No end to learning:</line>
      <line>Earn the means first—God surely will contrive</line>
      <line>Use for our earning.</line>
      <line>Others mistrust and say, ‘But time escapes:</line>
      <line>‘Live now or never!’</line>
      <line>He said, ‘What’s time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!</line>
      <line>‘Man has Forever.’</line>
      <line>Back to his book then: deeper drooped his head:</line>
      <line>Calculus racked him:</line>
      <line>Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of lead:</line>
      <line>Tussis attacked him.</line>
      <line>‘Now, master, take a little rest!’—not he!</line>
      <line>(Caution redoubled,</line>
      <line>Step two abreast, the way winds narrowly!)</line>
      <line>Not a whit troubled</line>
      <line>Back to his studies, fresher than at first,</line>
      <line>Fierce as a dragon</line>
      <line>He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred thirst)</line>
      <line>Sucked at the flagon.</line>
      <line>Oh, if we draw a circle premature,</line>
      <line>Heedless of far gain,</line>
      <line>Greedy for quick returns of profit, sure</line>
      <line>Bad is our bargain!</line>
      <line>Was it not great? did not he throw on God,</line>
      <line>(He loves the burthen)—</line>
      <line>God’s task to make the heavenly period</line>
      <line>Perfect the earthen?</line>
      <line>Did not he magnify the mind, show clear</line>
      <line>Just what it all meant?</line>
      <line>He would not discount life, as fools do here,</line>
      <line>Paid by instalment.</line>
      <line>He ventured neck or nothing—heaven’s success</line>
      <line>Found, or earth’s failure: no</line>
      <line>‘Wilt thou trust death or not?’ He answered ‘Yes:</line>
      <line>‘Hence with life’s pale lure!’</line>
      <line>That low man seeks a little thing to do,</line>
      <line>Sees it and does it:</line>
      <line>This high man, with a great thing to pursue,</line>
      <line>Dies ere he knows it.</line>
      <line>That low man goes on adding one to one,</line>
      <line>His hundred’s soon hit:</line>
      <line>This high man, aiming at a million,</line>
      <line>Misses an unit.</line>
      <line>That, has the world here—should he need the next,</line>
      <line>Let the world mind him!</line>
      <line>This, throws himself on God, and unperplexed</line>
      <line>Seeking shall find him.</line>
      <line>So, with the throttling hands of death at strife,</line>
      <line>Ground he at grammar;</line>
      <line>Still, thro’ the rattle, parts of speech were rife:</line>
      <line>While he could stammer</line>
      <line>He settled Hoti’s business—let it be!—</line>
      <line>Properly based Oun—</line>
      <line>Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic De,</line>
      <line>Dead from the waist down.</line>
      <line>Well, here’s the platform, here’s the proper place:</line>
      <line>Hail to your purlieus,</line>
      <line>All ye highfliers of the feathered race,</line>
      <line>Swallows and curlews!</line>
      <line>Here’s the top-peak; the multitude below</line>
      <line>Live, for they can, there:</line>
      <line>This man decided not to Live but Know—</line>
      <line>Bury this man there?</line>
      <line>Here—here’s his place, where meteors shoot, clouds form,</line>
      <line>Lightnings are loosened,</line>
      <line>Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,</line>
      <line>Peace let the dew send!</line>
      <line>Lofty designs must close in like effects:</line>
      <line>Loftily lying,</line>
      <line>Leave him—still loftier than the world suspects,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>What is he buzzing in my ears?</line>
      <line>‘Now that I come to die,</line>
      <line>‘Do I view the world as a vale of tears?’</line>
      <line>Ah, reverend sir, not I!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What I viewed there once, what I view again</line>
      <line>Where the physic bottles stand</line>
      <line>On the table’s edge,—is a suburb lane,</line>
      <line>With a wall to my bedside hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That lane sloped, much as the bottles do,</line>
      <line>From a house you could descry</line>
      <line>O’er the garden-wall: is the curtain blue</line>
      <line>Or green to a healthy eye?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To mine, it serves for the old June weather</line>
      <line>Blue above lane and wall;</line>
      <line>And that farthest bottle labelled ‘Ether’</line>
      <line>Is the house o’ertopping all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At a terrace, somewhere near the stopper,</line>
      <line>There watched for me, one June,</line>
      <line>A girl: I know, sir, it’s improper,</line>
      <line>My poor mind’s out of tune.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Only, there was a way . . . you crept</line>
      <line>Close by the side, to dodge</line>
      <line>Eyes in the house, two eyes except:</line>
      <line>They styled their house ‘The Lodge’.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What right had a lounger up their lane?</line>
      <line>But, by creeping very close,</line>
      <line>With the good wall’s help,—their eyes might strain</line>
      <line>And stretch themselves to Oes,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet never catch her and me together,</line>
      <line>As she left the attic, there,</line>
      <line>By the rim of the bottle labelled ‘Ether’,</line>
      <line>And stole from stair to stair,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And stood by the rose-wreathed gate. Alas,</line>
      <line>We loved, sir—used to meet:</line>
      <line>How sad and bad and mad it was—</line>
      <line>But then, how it was sweet!</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>It once might have been, once only:</line>
      <line>We lodged in a street together,</line>
      <line>You, a sparrow on the housetop lonely,</line>
      <line>I, a lone she-bird of his feather.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Your trade was with sticks and clay,</line>
      <line>You thumbed, thrust, patted and polished,</line>
      <line>Then laughed ‘They will see some day</line>
      <line>‘Smith made, and Gibson demolished.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My business was song, song, song;</line>
      <line>I chirped, cheeped, trilled and twittered,</line>
      <line>‘Kate Brown’s on the boards ere long,</line>
      <line>‘And Grisi’s existence embittered!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I earned no more by a warble</line>
      <line>Than you by a sketch in plaster;</line>
      <line>You wanted a piece of marble,</line>
      <line>I needed a music-master.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We studied hard in our styles,</line>
      <line>Chipped each at a crust like Hindoos,</line>
      <line>For air looked out on the tiles,</line>
      <line>For fun watched each other’s windows.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You lounged, like a boy of the South,</line>
      <line>Cap and blouse—nay, a bit of beard too;</line>
      <line>Or you got it, rubbing your mouth</line>
      <line>With fingers the clay adhered to.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I—soon managed to find</line>
      <line>Weak points in the flower-fence facing,</line>
      <line>Was forced to put up a blind</line>
      <line>And be safe in my corset-lacing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No harm! It was not my fault</line>
      <line>If you never turned your eye’s tail up</line>
      <line>As I shook upon E in alt,</line>
      <line>Or ran the chromatic scale up:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For spring bade the sparrows pair,</line>
      <line>And the boys and girls gave guesses,</line>
      <line>And stalls in our street looked rare</line>
      <line>With bulrush and watercresses.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why did you not pinch a flower</line>
      <line>In a pellet of clay and fling it?</line>
      <line>Why did not I put a power</line>
      <line>Of thanks in a look, or sing it?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I did look, sharp as a lynx,</line>
      <line>(And yet the memory rankles)</line>
      <line>When models arrived, some minx</line>
      <line>Tripped up-stairs, she and her ankles.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But I think I gave you as good!</line>
      <line>‘That foreign fellow,—who can know</line>
      <line>‘How she pays, in a playful mood,</line>
      <line>‘For his tuning her that piano?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Could you say so, and never say</line>
      <line>‘Suppose we join hands and fortunes,</line>
      <line>‘And I fetch her from over the way,</line>
      <line>‘Her, piano, and long tunes and short tunes?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No, no: you would not be rash,</line>
      <line>Nor I rasher and something over:</line>
      <line>You’ve to settle yet Gibson’s hash,</line>
      <line>And Grisi yet lives in clover.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But you meet the Prince at the Board,</line>
      <line>I’m queen myself at bals-pare,</line>
      <line>I’ve married a rich old lord,</line>
      <line>And you’re dubbed knight and an R.A.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Each life unfulfilled, you see;</line>
      <line>It hangs still, patchy and scrappy:</line>
      <line>We have not sighed deep, laughed free,</line>
      <line>Starved, feasted, despaired,—been happy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And nobody calls you a dunce,</line>
      <line>And people suppose me clever:</line>
      <line>This could but have happened once,</line>
      <line>And we missed it, lost it for ever.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>[’Will sprawl, now that the heat of day is best,</line>
      <line>Flat on his belly in the pit’s much mire,</line>
      <line>With elbows wide, fists clenched to prop his chin.</line>
      <line>And, while he kicks both feet in the cool slush,</line>
      <line>And feels about his spine small eft-things course,</line>
      <line>Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh:</line>
      <line>And while above his head a pompion-plant,</line>
      <line>Coating the cave-top as a brow its eye,</line>
      <line>Creeps down to touch and tickle hair and beard,</line>
      <line>And now a flower drops with a bee inside,</line>
      <line>And now a fruit to snap at, catch and crunch,—</line>
      <line>He looks out o’er yon sea which sunbeams cross</line>
      <line>And recross till they weave a spider-web</line>
      <line>(Meshes of fire, some great fish breaks at times)</line>
      <line>And talks to his own self, howe’er he please,</line>
      <line>Touching that other, whom his dam called God.</line>
      <line>Because to talk about Him, vexes—ha,</line>
      <line>Could He but know! and time to vex is now,</line>
      <line>When talk is safer than in winter-time.</line>
      <line>Moreover Prosper and Miranda sleep</line>
      <line>In confidence he drudges at their task,</line>
      <line>And it is good to cheat the pair, and gibe,</line>
      <line>Letting the rank tongue blossom into speech.]</line>

      <line>Setebos, Setebos, and Setebos!</line>
      <line>’Thinketh, He dwelleth i’ the cold o’ the moon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Thinketh He made it, with the sun to match,</line>
      <line>But not the stars; the stars came otherwise;</line>
      <line>Only made clouds, winds, meteors, such as that:</line>
      <line>Also this isle, what lives and grows thereon,</line>
      <line>And snaky sea which rounds and ends the same.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>'Thinketh, it came of being ill at ease:</line>
      <line>He hated that He cannot change His cold,</line>
      <line>Nor cure its ache. ’Hath spied an icy fish</line>
      <line>That longed to ’scape the rock-stream where she lived,</line>
      <line>And thaw herself within the lukewarm brine</line>
      <line>O’ the lazy sea her stream thrusts far amid,</line>
      <line>A crystal spike ’twixt two warm walls of wave;</line>
      <line>Only, she ever sickened, found repulse</line>
      <line>At the other kind of water, not her life,</line>
      <line>(Green-dense and dim-delicious, bred o’ the sun)</line>
      <line>Flounced back from bliss she was not born to breathe,</line>
      <line>And in her old bounds buried her despair,</line>
      <line>Hating and loving warmth alike: so He.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,</line>
      <line>Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing.</line>
      <line>Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;</line>
      <line>Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,</line>
      <line>That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown</line>
      <line>He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye</line>
      <line>By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue</line>
      <line>That pricks deep into oakwarts for a worm,</line>
      <line>And says a plain word when she finds her prize,</line>
      <line>But will not eat the ants; the ants themselves</line>
      <line>That build a wall of seeds and settled stalks</line>
      <line>About their hole—He made all these and more,</line>
      <line>Made all we see, and us, in spite: how else?</line>
      <line>He could not, Himself, make a second self</line>
      <line>To be His mate; as well have made Himself:</line>
      <line>He would not make what he mislikes or slights,</line>
      <line>An eyesore to Him, or not worth His pains:</line>
      <line>But did, in envy, listlessness or sport,</line>
      <line>Make what Himself would fain, in a manner, be—</line>
      <line>Weaker in most points, stronger in a few,</line>
      <line>Worthy, and yet mere playthings all the while,</line>
      <line>Things He admires and mocks too,—that is it.</line>
      <line>Because, so brave, so better though they be,</line>
      <line>It nothing skills if He begin to plague.</line>
      <line>Look now, I melt a gourd-fruit into mash,</line>
      <line>Add honeycomb and pods, I have perceived,</line>
      <line>Which bite like finches when they bill and kiss,—</line>
      <line>Then, when froth rises bladdery, drink up all,</line>
      <line>Quick, quick, till maggots scamper through my brain;</line>
      <line>Last, throw me on my back i’ the seeded thyme,</line>
      <line>And wanton, wishing I were born a bird.</line>
      <line>Put case, unable to be what I wish,</line>
      <line>I yet could make a live bird out of clay:</line>
      <line>Would not I take clay, pinch my Caliban</line>
      <line>Able to fly?—for, there, see, he hath wings,</line>
      <line>And great comb like the hoopoe’s to admire,</line>
      <line>And there, a sting to do his foes offence,</line>
      <line>There, and I will that he begin to live,</line>
      <line>Fly to yon rock-top, nip me off the horns</line>
      <line>Of grigs high up that make the merry din,</line>
      <line>Saucy through their veined wings, and mind me not.</line>
      <line>In which feat, if his leg snapped, brittle clay,</line>
      <line>And he lay stupid-like,—why, I should laugh;</line>
      <line>And if he, spying me, should fall to weep,</line>
      <line>Beseech me to be good, repair his wrong,</line>
      <line>Bid his poor leg smart less or grow again,—</line>
      <line>Well, as the chance were, this might take or else</line>
      <line>Not take my fancy: I might hear his cry,</line>
      <line>And give the mankin three sound legs for one,</line>
      <line>Or pluck the other off, leave him like an egg,</line>
      <line>And lessoned he was mine and merely clay.</line>
      <line>Were this no pleasure, lying in the thyme,</line>
      <line>Drinking the mash, with brain become alive,</line>
      <line>Making and marring clay at will? So He.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him,</line>
      <line>Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord.</line>
      <line>’Am strong myself compared to yonder crabs</line>
      <line>That march now from the mountain to the sea,</line>

      <line>As it likes me each time, I do: so He.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Well then, ’supposeth He is good i’ the main,</line>
      <line>Placable if His mind and ways were guessed,</line>
      <line>But rougher than His handiwork, be sure!</line>
      <line>Oh, He hath made things worthier than Himself,</line>
      <line>And envieth that, so helped, such things do more</line>
      <line>Than He who made them! What consoles but this?</line>
      <line>That they, unless through Him, do nought at all,</line>
      <line>And must submit: what other use in things?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Hath cut a pipe of pithless elder joint</line>
      <line>That, blown through, gives exact the scream o’ the jay</line>

      <line>Sound this, and little birds that hate the jay</line>
      <line>Flock within stone’s throw, glad their foe is hurt:</line>

      <line>But wherefore rough, why cold and ill at ease?</line>
      <line>Aha, that is a question! Ask, for that,</line>
      <line>What knows,—the something over Setebos</line>
      <line>That made Him, or He, may be, found and fought, 1</line>
      <line>Worsted, drove off and did to nothing, perchance.</line>
      <line>There may be something quiet o’er His head,</line>
      <line>Out of His reach, that feels nor joy nor grief,</line>
      <line>Since both derive from weakness in some way.</line>
      <line>I joy because the quails come; would not joy</line>
      <line>Could I bring quails here when I have a mind:</line>
      <line>This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth.</line>
      <line>’Esteemeth stars the outposts of its couch,</line>
      <line>But never spends much thought nor care that way.</line>

      <line>To what is quiet and hath happy life;</line>
      <line>Next looks down here, and out of very spite</line>

      <line>Also a sea-beast, lumpish, which he snared,</line>
      <line>Blinded the eyes of, and brought somewhat tame,</line>
      <line>And split its toe-webs, and now pens the drudge</line>
      <line>In a hole o’ the rock and calls him Caliban;</line>
      <line>A bitter heart that bides its time and bites.</line>

      <line>Who made them weak, meant weakness He might vex.</line>
      <line>Had He meant other, while His hand was in,</line>
      <line>Why not make horny eyes no thorn could prick,</line>
      <line>Or plate my scalp with bone against the snow,</line>
      <line>Or overscale my flesh ’neath joint and joint,</line>
      <line>Like an ore’s armour? Ay,—so spoil His sport!</line>
      <line>He is the One now: only He doth all.</line>
      <line>’Saith, He may like, perchance, what profits Him.</line>
      <line>Ay, himself loves what does him good; but why?</line>
      <line>’Gets good no otherwise. This blinded beast</line>
      <line>Loves whoso places flesh-meat on his nose,</line>
      <line>But, had he eyes, would want no help, but hate</line>
      <line>Or love, just as it liked him: He hath eyes.</line>
      <line>Also it pleaseth Setebos to work,</line>
      <line>Use all His hands, and exercise much craft,</line>
      <line>By no means for the love of what is worked.</line>
      <line>’Tasteth, himself, no finer good i’ the world</line>
      <line>When all goes right, in this safe summer-time,</line>
      <line>And he wants little, hungers, aches not much,</line>
      <line>Than trying what to do with wit and strength.</line>
      <line>’Falls to make something: ’piled yon pile of turfs,</line>
      <line>And squared and stuck there squares of soft white chalk,</line>
      <line>And, with a fish-tooth, scratched a moon on each,</line>
      <line>And set up endwise certain spikes of tree,</line>
      <line>And crowned the whole with a sloth’s skull a-top,</line>
      <line>Found dead i’ the woods, too hard for one to kill.</line>
      <line>No use at all i’ the work, for work’s sole sake;</line>

      <line>One hurricane will spoil six good months’ hope.</line>
      <line>He hath a spite against me, that I know,</line>
      <line>Just as He favours Prosper, who knows why?</line>
      <line>So it is, all the same, as well I find.</line>
      <line>’Wove wattles half the winter, fenced them firm</line>
      <line>With stone and stake to stop she-tortoises</line>
      <line>Crawling to lay their eggs here: well, one wave,</line>
      <line>Feeling the foot of Him upon its neck,</line>
      <line>Gaped as a snake does, lolled out its large tongue,</line>
      <line>And licked the whole labour flat: so much for spite.</line>
      <line>’Saw a ball flame down late (yonder it lies)</line>
      <line>Where, half an hour before, I slept i’ the shade:</line>
      <line>Often they scatter sparkles: there is force!</line>

      <line>Aha, if He would tell me how! Not He!</line>
      <line>There is the sport: discover how or die!</line>
      <line>All need not die, for of the things o’ the isle</line>
      <line>Some flee afar, some dive, some run up trees;</line>
      <line>Those at His mercy,—why, they please Him most</line>
      <line>When . .. when . .. well, never try the same way twice!</line>
      <line>Repeat what act has pleased, He may grow wroth.</line>
      <line>You must not know His ways, and play Him off,</line>
      <line>Sure of the issue. ’Doth the like himself:</line>
      <line>’Spareth a squirrel that it nothing fears</line>
      <line>But steals the nut from underneath my thumb,</line>
      <line>And when I threat, bites stoutly in defence:</line>
      <line>’Spareth an urchin that contrariwise,</line>
      <line>Curls up into a ball, pretending death</line>
      <line>For fright at my approach: the two ways please.</line>
      <line>But what would move my choler more than this,</line>
      <line>That either creature counted on its life</line>
      <line>To-morrow and next day and all days to come,</line>
      <line>Saying, forsooth, in the inmost of its heart,</line>
      <line>‘Because he did so yesterday with me,</line>
      <line>‘And otherwise with such another brute,</line>
      <line>‘So must he do henceforth and always.’—Ay?</line>

      <line>So long as He lives, keeps His strength: no change,</line>
      <line>If He have done His best, make no new world</line>
      <line>To please Him more, so leave off watching this,—</line>
      <line>If He surprise not even the Quiet’s self</line>
      <line>Some strange day,—or, suppose, grow into it</line>
      <line>As grubs grow butterflies: else, here are we,</line>
      <line>And there is He, and nowhere help at all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Believeth with the life, the pain shall stop.</line>
      <line>His dam held different, that after death</line>
      <line>He both plagued enemies and feasted friends:</line>
      <line>Idly! He doth His worst in this our life,</line>
      <line>Giving just respite lest we die through pain,</line>
      <line>Saving last pain for worst,—with which, an end.</line>
      <line>Meanwhile, the best way to escape His ire</line>
      <line>Is, not to seem too happy. ’Sees, himself,</line>
      <line>Yonder two flies, with purple films and pink,</line>
      <line>Bask on the pompion-bell above: kills both.</line>
      <line>’Sees two black painful beetles roll their ball</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>My Father was a scholar and knew Greek.</line>
      <line>When I was five years old, I asked him once</line>
      <line>‘What do you read about?’</line>
      <line>‘The siege of Troy.’</line>
      <line>‘What is a siege and what is Troy?’</line>
      <line>Whereat</line>
      <line>He piled up chairs and tables for a town,</line>
      <line>Set me a-top for Priam, called our cat</line>
      <line>—Helen, enticed away from home (he said)</line>
      <line>By wicked Paris, who couched somewhere close</line>
      <line>Under the footstool, being cowardly,</line>
      <line>But whom—since she was worth the pains, poor puss—</line>
      <line>Towzer and Tray,—our dogs, the Atreidai,—sought</line>
      <line>By taking Troy to get possession of</line>
      <line>—Always when great Achilles ceased to sulk,</line>
      <line>(My pony in the stable)—forth would prance</line>
      <line>And put to flight Hector—our page-boy’s self.</line>
      <line>This taught me who was who and what was what:</line>
      <line>So far I rightly understood the case</line>
      <line>At five years old: a huge delight it proved</line>
      <line>And still proves—thanks to that instructor sage</line>
      <line>My Father, who knew better than turn straight</line>
      <line>Learning’s full flare on weak-eyed ignorance,</line>
      <line>Or, worse yet, leave weak eyes to grow sand-blind,</line>
      <line>Content with darkness and vacuity.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It happened, two or three years afterward,</line>
      <line>That—I and playmates playing at Troy’s Siege—</line>
      <line>My Father came upon our make-believe.</line>
      <line>‘How would you like to read yourself the tale</line>
      <line>Properly told, of which I gave you first</line>
      <line>Merely such notion as a boy could bear?</line>
      <line>Pope, now, would give you the precise account</line>
      <line>Of what, some day, by dint of scholarship,</line>
      <line>You’ll hear—who knows?—from Homer’s very mouth.</line>
      <line>Learn Greek by all means, read the “Blind Old Man,</line>
      <line>Sweetest of Singers”—tuphlos which means “blind,”</line>
      <line>Hedistos which means “sweetest,” Time enough!</line>
      <line>Try, anyhow, to master him some day;</line>
      <line>Until when, take what serves for substitute,</line>
      <line>Read Pope, by all means!’</line>
      <line>So I ran through Pope,</line>
      <line>Enjoyed the tale—what history so true?</line>
      <line>Also attacked my Primer, duly drudged,</line>
      <line>Grew fitter thus for what was promised next—</line>
      <line>The very thing itself, the actual words,</line>
      <line>When I could turn—say, Buttmann to account.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Time passed, I ripened somewhat: one fine day,</line>
      <line>‘Quite ready for the Iliad, nothing less?</line>
      <line>There’s Heine, where the big books block the shelf:</line>
      <line>Don’t skip a word, thumb well the Lexicon!’</line>
      <line>I thumbed well and skipped nowise till I learned</line>
      <line>Who was who, what was what, from Homer’s tongue,</line>
      <line>And there an end of learning. Had you asked</line>
      <line>The all-accomplished scholar, twelve years old,</line>
      <line>‘Who was it wrote the Iliad?’—what a laugh!</line>
      <line>‘Why, Homer, all the world knows: of his life</line>
      <line>Doubtless some facts exist: it’s everywhere:</line>
      <line>We have not settled, though, his place of birth:</line>
      <line>He begged, for certain, and was blind beside:</line>
      <line>Seven cities claimed him—Scio, with best right,</line>
      <line>Thinks Byron. What he wrote? Those Hymns we have.</line>
      <line>Then there’s the “Battle of the Frogs and Mice,”</line>
      <line>That’s all—unless they dig “Margites” up</line>
      <line>(I’d like that) nothing more remains to know.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus did youth spend a comfortable time;</line>
      <line>Until—‘What’s this the Germans say is fact</line>
      <line>That Wolf found out first? It’s unpleasant work</line>
      <line>Their chop and change, unsettling one’s belief:</line>
      <line>All the same, while we live, we learn, that’s sure.’</line>
      <line>So, I bent brow o’er Prolegomena.</line>
      <line>And, after Wolf, a dozen of his like</line>
      <line>Proved there was never any Troy at all,</line>
      <line>Neither Besiegers nor Besieged,—nay, worse,—</line>
      <line>No actual Homer, no authentic text,</line>
      <line>No warrant for the fiction I, as fact,</line>
      <line>Had treasured in my heart and soul so long—</line>
      <line>Ay, mark you! and as fact held still, still hold,</line>
      <line>Spite of new knowledge, in my heart of hearts</line>
      <line>And soul of souls, fact’s essence freed and fixed</line>
      <line>From accidental fancy’s guardian sheath.</line>
      <line>Assuredly thenceforward—thank my stars!—</line>
      <line>However it got there, deprive who could—</line>
      <line>Wring from the shrine my precious tenantry,</line>
      <line>Helen, Ulysses, Hector and his Spouse,</line>
      <line>Achilles and his Friend?—though Wolf—ah, Wolf!</line>
      <line>Why must he needs come doubting, spoil a dream?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But then ‘No dream’s worth waking’—Browning says:</line>
      <line>And here’s the reason why I tell thus much.</line>
      <line>I, now mature man, you anticipate,</line>
      <line>May blame my Father justifiably</line>
      <line>For letting me dream out my nonage thus,</line>
      <line>And only by such slow and sure degrees</line>
      <line>Permitting me to sift the grain from chaff,</line>
      <line>Get truth and falsehood known and named as such.</line>
      <line>Why did he ever let me dream at all,</line>
      <line>Not bid me taste the story in its strength?</line>
      <line>Suppose my childhood was scarce qualified</line>
      <line>To rightly understand mythology,</line>
      <line>Silence at least was in his power to keep:</line>
      <line>I might have—somehow—correspondingly—</line>
      <line>Well, who knows by what method, gained my gains,</line>
      <line>Been taught, by forthrights not meanderings,</line>
      <line>My aim should be to loathe, like Peleus’ son,</line>
      <line>A lie as Hell’s Gate, love my wedded wife,</line>
      <line>Like Hector, and so on with all the rest.</line>
      <line>Could not I have excogitated this</line>
      <line>Without believing such men really were?</line>
      <line>That is—he might have put into my hand</line>
      <line>The ‘Ethics’? In translation, if you please,</line>
      <line>Exact, no pretty lying that improves,</line>
      <line>To suit the modern taste: no more, no less—</line>
      <line>The ‘Ethics’: ’t is a treatise I find hard</line>
      <line>To read aright now that my hair is grey,</line>
      <line>And I can manage the original.</line>
      <line>At five years old—how ill had fared its leaves!</line>
      <line>Now, growing double o’er the Stagirite,</line>
      <line>At least I soil no page with bread and milk,</line>
      <line>Nor crumple, dogsear and deface—boys’ way.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Around her shrine no earthly blossoms blow,</line>
      <line>No footsteps fret the pathway to and fro;</line>
      <line>No sign nor record of departed prayer,</line>
      <line>Print of the stone, nor echo of the air;</line>
      <line>Worn by the lip, nor wearied by the knee,—</line>
      <line>Only a deeper silence of the sea:</line>
      <line>For there, in passing, pause the breezes bleak,</line>
      <line>And the foam fades, and all the waves are weak.</line>
      <line>The pulse-like oars in softer fall succeed,</line>
      <line>The black prow falters through the wild seaweed—</line>
      <line>Where, twilight-borne, the minute thunders reach</line>
      <line>Of deep-mouthed surf, that bays by Lido’s beach,</line>
      <line>With intermittent motion traversed far,</line>
      <line>And shattered glancing of the western star,</line>
      <line>Till the faint storm-bird on the heaving flow</line>
      <line>Drops in white circles, silently like snow.</line>
      <line>Not here the ponderous gem, nor pealing note,</line>
      <line>Dim to adorn—insentient to adore—</line>
      <line>But purple-dyed, the mists of evening float,</line>
      <line>In ceaseless incense from the burning floor</line>
      <line>Of ocean, and the gathered gold of heaven</line>
      <line>Laces its sapphire vault, and, early given,</line>
      <line>The white rays of the rushing firmament</line>
      <line>Pierce the blue-quivering night through wreath or rent</line>
      <line>Of cloud inscrutable and motionless,</line>
      <line>Hectic and wan, and moon-companioned cloud!</line>
      <line>Oh! lone Madonna—angel of the deep—</line>
      <line>When the night falls, and deadly winds are loud,</line>
      <line>Will not thy love be with us while we keep</line>
      <line>Our watch upon the waters, and the gaze 30</line>
      <line>Of thy soft eyes, that slumber not, nor sleep?</line>
      <line>Deem not thou, stranger, that such trust is vain;</line>
      <line>Faith walks not on these weary waves alone,</line>
      <line>Though weakness dread, or apathy disdain</line>
      <line>The spot which God has hallowed for His own.</line>
      <line>They sin who pass it lightly—ill divining</line>
      <line>The glory of this place of bitter prayer;</line>
      <line>And hoping against hope, and self-resigning,</line>
      <line>And reach of faith, and wrestling with despair,</line>
      <line>And resurrection of the last distress,</line>
      <line>Into the sense of heaven, when earth is bare,</line>
      <line>And of God’s voice, when man’s is comfortless.</line>

      <line>Courage and faith; vain faith, and courage vain.</line>
      <line>For him, I threw lands, honours, wealth, away,</line>
      <line>And one dear hope, that was more prized than they.</line>
      <line>For him I languished in a foreign clime,</line>
      <line>Grey-haired with sorrow in my manhood’s prime;</line>
      <line>Heard on Lavernia Scargill’s whispering trees,</line>
      <line>And pined by Arno for my lovelier Tees;</line>
      <line>Beheld each night my home in fevered sleep,</line>
      <line>Each morning started from the dream to weep;</line>
      <line>Till God, who saw me tried too sorely, gave</line>
      <line>The resting place I asked, an early grave.</line>
      <line>Oh thou, whom chance leads to this nameless stone,</line>
      <line>From that proud country which was once mine own,</line>
      <line>By those white cliffs I never more must see,</line>
      <line>By that dear language which I spake like thee,</line>
      <line>Forget all feuds, and shed one English tear</line>
      <line>O’er English dust. A broken heart lies here.</line>

      <line>What I tell you three times is true.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The crew was complete: it included a Boots—</line>
      <line>A maker of Bonnets and Hoods—</line>
      <line>A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—</line>
      <line>And a Broker, to value their goods.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,</line>
      <line>Might perhaps have won more than his share—</line>
      <line>But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,</line>
      <line>Had the whole of their cash in his care.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,</line>
      <line>Or would sit making lace in the bow:</line>
      <line>And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck</line>
      <line>Though none of the sailors knew how.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was one who was famed for the number of things</line>
      <line>He forgot when he entered the ship:</line>
      <line>His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,</line>
      <line>And the clothes he had bought for the trip.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,</line>
      <line>With his name painted clearly on each:</line>
      <line>But, since he omitted to mention the fact,</line>
      <line>They were all left behind on the beach.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because</line>
      <line>He had seven coats on when he came,</line>
      <line>With three pair of boots—but the worst of it was,</line>
      <line>He had wholly forgotten his name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He would answer to ‘Hi’ or to any loud cry,</line>
      <line>Such as ‘Fry me!’ or ‘Fritter my wig!’</line>
      <line>To ‘What-you-may-call-um!’ or ‘What-was-his-name!’</line>
      <line>But especially ‘Thing-um-a-jig!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,</line>
      <line>He had different names from these:</line>
      <line>His intimate friends called him ‘Candle-ends’,</line>
      <line>And his enemies ‘Toasted-cheese’.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘His form is ungainly—his intellect small—’</line>
      <line>(So the Bellman would often remark)—</line>
      <line>‘But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,</line>
      <line>Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He would joke with hyaenas, returning their stare</line>
      <line>With an impudent wag of the head:</line>
      <line>And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,</line>
      <line>‘Just to keep up its spirits,’ he said.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late—</line>
      <line>And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad—</line>
      <line>He could only bake Bridecake—for which, I may state,</line>
      <line>No materials were to be had.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The last of the crew needs especial remark,</line>
      <line>Though he looked an incredible dunce:</line>
      <line>He had just one idea—but, that one being ‘Snark’,</line>
      <line>The good Bellman engaged him at once.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,</line>
      <line>When the ship had been sailing a week,</line>
      <line>He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,</line>
      <line>And was almost too frightened to speak:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,</line>
      <line>There was only one Beaver on board;</line>
      <line>And that was a tame one he had of his own,</line>
      <line>Whose death would be deeply deplored.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,</line>
      <line>Protested, with tears in its eyes,</line>
      <line>That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark</line>
      <line>Could atone for that dismal surprise!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It strongly advised that the Butcher should be</line>
      <line>Conveyed in a separate ship:</line>
      <line>But the Bellman declared that would never agree</line>
      <line>With the plans he had made for the trip:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Navigation was always a difficult art,</line>
      <line>Though with only one ship and one bell:</line>
      <line>And he feared he must really decline, for his part,</line>
      <line>Undertaking another as well.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Beaver’s best course was, no doubt, to procure</line>
      <line>A second-hand dagger-proof coat—</line>
      <line>So the Baker advised it—and next, to insure</line>
      <line>Its life in some Office of note:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This the Baker suggested, and offered for hire</line>
      <line>(On moderate terms), or for sale,</line>
      <line>Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire</line>
      <line>And one Against Damage From Hail.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,</line>
      <line>Whenever the Butcher was by,</line>
      <line>The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,</line>
      <line>And appeared unaccountably shy.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies—</line>
      <line>Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!</line>
      <line>Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,</line>
      <line>The moment one looked in his face!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had bought a large map representing the sea,</line>
      <line>Without the least vestige of land:</line>
      <line>And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be</line>
      <line>A map they could all understand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘What’s the good of Mercator’s North Poles and Equators,</line>
      <line>Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?’</line>
      <line>So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply</line>
      <line>‘They are merely conventional signs!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!</line>
      <line>But we’ve got our brave Captain to thank’</line>
      <line>(So the crew would protest) ‘that he’s bought us the best—</line>
      <line>A perfect and absolute blank!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out</line>
      <line>That the Captain they trusted so well</line>
      <line>Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,</line>
      <line>And that was to tingle his bell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He was thoughtful and grave—but the orders he gave</line>
      <line>Were enough to bewilder a crew.</line>
      <line>When he cried ‘Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!’</line>
      <line>What on earth was the helmsman to do?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:</line>
      <line>A thing, as the Bellman remarked,</line>
      <line>That frequently happens in tropical climes,</line>
      <line>When a vessel is, so to speak, ‘snarked’.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,</line>
      <line>And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,</line>
      <line>Said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,</line>
      <line>That the ship would not travel due West!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the danger was past—they had landed at last,</line>
      <line>With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:</line>
      <line>Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view</line>
      <line>Which consisted of chasms and crags.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,</line>
      <line>And repeated in musical tone</line>
      <line>Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe—</line>
      <line>But the crew would do nothing but groan.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He served out some grog with a liberal hand,</line>
      <line>And bade them sit down on the beach:</line>
      <line>And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,</line>
      <line>As he stood and delivered his speech.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!’</line>
      <line>(They were all of them fond of quotations:</line>
      <line>So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers,</line>
      <line>While he served out additional rations).</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,</line>
      <line>(Four weeks to the month you may mark),</line>

      <line>Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>He thought of his childhood, left far behind—</line>

      <line>‘’Tis the voice of the Jubjub!’ he suddenly cried.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘Two added to one—if that could but be done’,</line>

      <line>‘The thing can be done,’ said the Butcher, ‘I think.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain</line>
      <line>That the Beaver’s lace-making was wrong,</line>
      <line>Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain</line>
      <line>That his fancy had dwelt on so long.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,</line>
      <line>Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,</line>
      <line>Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig</line>
      <line>On the charge of deserting its sty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,</line>
      <line>That the sty was deserted when found:</line>
      <line>And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law</line>
      <line>In a soft under-current of sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The indictment had never been clearly expressed,</line>
      <line>And it seemed that the Snark had begun,</line>
      <line>And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed</line>
      <line>What the pig was supposed to have done.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Jury had each formed a different view</line>
      <line>(Long before the indictment was read),</line>
      <line>And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew</line>
      <line>One word that the others had said.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘You must know—’ said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed ‘Fudge!</line>
      <line>That statute is obsolete quite!</line>
      <line>Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends</line>
      <line>On an ancient manorial right.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘In the matter of Treason the pig would appear</line>
      <line>To have aided, but scarcely abetted:</line>
      <line>While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,</line>
      <line>If you grant the plea “never indebted”.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:</line>
      <line>But its guilt, as I trust, is removed</line>
      <line>(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)</line>
      <line>By the Alibi which has been proved.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘My poor client’s fate now depends on your votes.’</line>
      <line>Here the speaker sat down in his place,</line>
      <line>And directed the Judge to refer to his notes</line>
      <line>And briefly to sum up the case.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But the Judge said he never had summed up before;</line>
      <line>So the Snark undertook it instead,</line>
      <line>And summed it so well that it came to far more</line>
      <line>Than the Witnesses ever had said!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,</line>
      <line>As the word was so puzzling to spell;</line>
      <line>But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn’t mind</line>
      <line>Undertaking that duty as well.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,</line>
      <line>It was spent with the toils of the day:</line>
      <line>When it said the word ‘guilty!’ the Jury all groaned</line>
      <line>And some of them fainted away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite</line>
      <line>Too nervous to utter a word:</line>
      <line>When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,</line>
      <line>And the fall of a pin might be heard.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Transportation for life’ was the sentence it gave,</line>
      <line>‘And then to be fined forty pound.’</line>
      <line>The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared</line>
      <line>That the phrase was not legally sound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But their wild exultation was suddenly checked</line>
      <line>When the jailer informed them, with tears,</line>
      <line>Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,</line>
      <line>As the pig had been dead for some years.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted</line>
      <line>But the Snark, though a little aghast,</line>
      <line>As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,</line>
      <line>Went bellowing on to the last.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed</line>
      <line>To grow every moment more clear:</line>
      <line>Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,</line>
      <line>Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;</line>
      <line>They pursued it with forks and hope;</line>
      <line>They threatened its life with a railway-share;</line>
      <line>They charmed it with smiles and soap.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new</line>
      <line>It was matter for general remark,</line>
      <line>Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view</line>
      <line>In his zeal to discover the Snark.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,</line>
      <line>A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh</line>
      <line>And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,</line>
      <line>For he knew it was useless to fly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He offered large discount—he offered a cheque</line>
      <line>(Drawn ‘to bearer’) for seven-pounds-ten:</line>
      <line>But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck</line>
      <line>And grabbed at the Banker again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Without rest or pause—while those frumious jaws</line>
      <line>Went savagely snapping around—</line>
      <line>He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,</line>
      <line>Till fainting he fell to the ground.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared</line>
      <line>Led on by that fear-stricken yell:</line>
      <line>And the Bellman remarked ‘It is just as I feared!’</line>
      <line>And solemnly tolled on his bell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace</line>
      <line>The least likeness to what he had been:</line>
      <line>While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white—</line>
      <line>A wonderful thing to be seen!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To the horror of all who were present that day,</line>
      <line>He uprose in full evening dress,</line>
      <line>And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say</line>
      <line>What his tongue could no longer express.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Down he sank in a chair—ran his hands through his hair—</line>
      <line>And chanted in mimsiest tones</line>
      <line>Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,</line>
      <line>While he rattled a couple of bones.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Leave him here to his fate—it is getting so late!’</line>
      <line>The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.</line>
      <line>‘We have lost half the day. Any further delay,</line>
      <line>And we sha’n’t catch a Snark before night!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;</line>
      <line>They pursued it with forks and hope;</line>
      <line>They threatened its life with a railway-share;</line>
      <line>They charmed it with smiles and soap.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,</line>
      <line>And the Beaver, excited at last,</line>
      <line>Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,</line>
      <line>For the daylight was nearly past.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘There is Thingumbob shouting!’ the Bellman said.</line>
      <line>‘He is shouting like mad, only hark!</line>
      <line>He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,</line>
      <line>He has certainly found a Snark!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed</line>
      <line>‘He was always a desperate wag!’</line>
      <line>They beheld him—their Baker—their hero unnamed—</line>
      <line>On the top of a neighbouring crag,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Erect and sublime, for one moment of time,</line>
      <line>In the next, that wild figure they saw</line>
      <line>(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,</line>
      <line>While they waited and listened in awe.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘It’s a Snark!’ was the sound that first came to their ears,</line>
      <line>And seemed almost too good to be true.</line>
      <line>Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:</line>
      <line>Then the ominous words ‘It’s a Boo—’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air</line>
      <line>A weary and wandering sigh</line>
      <line>That sounded like ‘—jum!’ but the others declare</line>
      <line>It was only a breeze that went by.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They hunted till darkness came on, but they found</line>
      <line>Not a button, or feather, or mark,</line>
      <line>By which they could tell that they stood on the ground</line>
      <line>Where the Baker had met with the Snark.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In the midst of the word he was trying to say,</line>
      <line>In the midst of his laughter and glee,</line>
      <line>He had softly and suddenly vanished away—</line>
      <line>For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.</line>

    <title>The Dong with a Luminous Nose</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>When awful darkness and silence reign</line>
      <line>Over the great Gromboolian plain,</line>
      <line>Through the long, long wintry nights;—</line>
      <line>When the angry breakers roar</line>
      <line>As they beat on the rocky shore;—</line>
      <line>When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</line>
      <line>Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore:—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, through the vast and gloomy dark,</line>
      <line>There moves what seems a fiery spark,</line>
      <line>A lonely spark with silvery rays</line>
      <line>Piercing the coal-black night,—</line>
      <line>A Meteor strange and bright:—</line>
      <line>Hither and thither the vision strays,</line>
      <line>A single lurid light.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Slowly it wanders,—pauses,—creeps,—</line>
      <line>Anon it sparkles,—flashes and leaps;</line>
      <line>And ever as onward it gleaming goes</line>
      <line>A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.</line>
      <line>And those who watch at that midnight hour</line>
      <line>From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,</line>
      <line>Cry, as the wild light passes along,—</line>
      <line>‘The Dong!—the Dong!</line>
      <line>‘The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</line>
      <line>‘The Dong! the Dong!</line>
      <line>‘The Dong with a luminous Nose!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Long years ago</line>
      <line>The Dong was happy and gay,</line>
      <line>Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl</line>
      <line>Who came to those shores one day,</line>
      <line>For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,—</line>
      <line>Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd</line>
      <line>Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</line>
      <line>And the rocks are smooth and gray.</line>
      <line>And all the woods and the valleys rang</line>
      <line>With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,—</line>
      <line>‘Far and few, far and few,</line>
      <line>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</line>
      <line>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue</line>
      <line>And they went to sea in a sieve.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Happily, happily passed those days!</line>
      <line>While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</line>
      <line>They danced in circlets all night long,</line>
      <line>To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</line>
      <line>In moonlight, shine, or shade.</line>
      <line>For day and night he was always there</line>
      <line>By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,</line>
      <line>With her sky-blue hands, and her sea-green hair.</line>
      <line>Till the morning came of that hateful day</line>
      <line>When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,</line>
      <line>And the Dong was left on the cruel shore</line>
      <line>Gazing—gazing for evermore,—</line>
      <line>Ever keeping his weary eyes on</line>
      <line>That pea-green sail on the far horizon,—</line>
      <line>Singing the Jumbly Chorus still</line>
      <line>As he sate all day on the grassy hill,—</line>
      <line>‘Far and few, far and few,</line>
      <line>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</line>
      <line>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</line>
      <line>And they went to sea in a sieve.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But when the sun was low in the West,</line>
      <line>The Dong arose and said,—</line>
      <line>—‘What little sense I once possessed</line>
      <line>Has quite gone out of my head!’—</line>
      <line>And since that day he wanders still</line>
      <line>By lake and forest, marsh and hill,</line>
      <line>Singing—‘O somewhere, in valley or plain</line>
      <line>‘Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!</line>
      <line>‘For ever I’ll seek by lake and shore</line>
      <line>‘Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</line>
      <line>Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks,</line>
      <line>And because by night he could not see,</line>
      <line>He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</line>
      <line>On the flowery plain that grows.</line>
      <line>And he wove him a wondrous Nose,—</line>
      <line>A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</line>
      <line>Of vast proportions and painted red,</line>
      <line>And tied with cords to the back of his head.</line>
      <line>—In a hollow rounded space it ended</line>
      <line>With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</line>
      <line>All fenced about</line>
      <line>With a bandage stout</line>
      <line>To prevent the wind from blowing it out;—</line>
      <line>And with holes all round to send the light,</line>
      <line>In gleaming rays on the dismal night.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And now each night, and all night long,</line>
      <line>Over those plains still roams the Dong;</line>
      <line>And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe</line>
      <line>You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe</line>
      <line>While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain</line>
      <line>To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;</line>
      <line>Lonely and wild—all night he goes,—</line>
      <line>The Dong with a luminous Nose!</line>
      <line>And all who watch at the midnight hour,</line>
      <line>From Hall or Terrace, or lofty Tower,</line>
      <line>Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,</line>
      <line>Moving along through the dreary night,—</line>
      <line>‘This is the hour when forth he goes,</line>
      <line>‘The Dong with a luminous Nose!</line>
      <line>‘Yonder—over the plain he goes;</line>
      <line>‘He goes!</line>

    <title>The New Vestments</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>There lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,</line>
      <line>Who invented a purely original dress;</line>
      <line>And when it was perfectly made and complete,</line>
      <line>He opened the door, and walked into the street.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>By way of a hat, he’d a loaf of Brown Bread,</line>
      <line>In the middle of which he inserted his head;—</line>
      <line>His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,</line>
      <line>The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;—</line>
      <line>His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins;—so were his Shoes;—</line>
      <line>His Stockings were skins,—but it is not known whose;—</line>
      <line>His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;—</line>
      <line>His Buttons were Jujubes, and Chocolate Drops;—</line>
      <line>His Coat was all Pancakes with Jam for a border,</line>
      <line>And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;</line>
      <line>And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,</line>
      <line>A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,</line>
      <line>Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;—</line>
      <line>And from every long street and dark lane in the town</line>
      <line>Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.</line>
      <line>Two Cows and a half ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;—</line>
      <line>Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;—</line>
      <line>Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,—</line>
      <line>And the tails were devour’d by an ancient He Goat;—</line>
      <line>An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore up his</line>
      <line>Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;—</line>
      <line>And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,</line>
      <line>Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.—</line>
      <line>He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,</line>
      <line>For Scores of fat Pigs came again and again;—</line>
      <line>They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors,—</line>
      <line>They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;—</line>
      <line>And now from the housetops with screechings descend,</line>
      <line>Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end,</line>
      <line>They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,—</line>
      <line>When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;—</line>
      <line>They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,</line>
      <line>And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;—</line>
      <line>They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,—</line>
      <line>Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And he said to himself as he bolted the door,</line>
      <line>‘I will not wear a similar dress any more,</line>
      <line>‘Any more, any more, any more, never more!’</line>

      <line>Leave such signs and wonders</line>
      <line>For the dullard brain,</line>
      <line>As aesthetic brandy,</line>
      <line>Opium and cayenne.</line>
      <line>Give me Bramshill common</line>
      <line>(St John’s harriers by),</line>
      <line>Or the vale of Windsor,</line>
      <line>England’s golden eye.</line>
      <line>Show me life and progress,</line>
      <line>Beauty, health, and man;</line>
      <line>Houses fair, trim gardens,</line>
      <line>Turn where’er I can.</line>

      <line>And such popish stuff,</line>
      <line>One’s poor ear need airing,</line>
      <line>Snowdon’s high enough.</line>
      <line>While we find God’s signet</line>

      <line>Desperate or strange;</line>
      <line>Feed on commonplaces</line>
      <line>In a narrow range;</line>
      <line>Never sought for Franklin</line>

      <line>Do the work that’s nearest,</line>
      <line>Though it’s dull at w'hiles,</line>
      <line>Helping, when we meet them,</line>
      <line>Lame dogs over stiles;</line>

      <line>Marks of angels’ feet,</line>

      <line>Beside me,—in the car,—she sat,</line>
      <line>She spake not, no, nor looked to me:</line>
      <line>From her to me, from me to her,</line>
      <line>What passed so subtly stealthily?</line>
      <line>As rose to rose that by it blows</line>
      <line>Its interchanged aroma flings;</line>
      <line>Or wake to sound of one sweet note</line>
      <line>The virtues of disparted strings.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beside me, nought but this!—but this,</line>

      <line>Her life, mine too within her breast,</line>
      <line>Her brain, her every limb she felt:</line>
      <line>We sat; while o’er and in us, more</line>
      <line>And more, a power unknown prevailed,</line>
      <line>Inhaling, and inhaled,—and still</line>
      <line>’Twas one, inhaling or inhaled.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beside me, nought but this;—and passed;</line>
      <line>I passed; and know not to this day</line>
      <line>If gold or jet her girlish hair,</line>
      <line>If black, or brown, or lucid-grey</line>
      <line>Her eye’s young glance: the fickle chance</line>
      <line>That joined us, yet may join again;</line>
      <line>But I no face again could greet</line>
      <line>As hers, whose life was in me then.</line>

      <line>Or vestal, say, of saintliest clay,</line>
      <line>For once by balmiest airs betrayed</line>

      <line>To be unlingeringly gainsaid:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Unowning then, confusing soon</line>
      <line>With dreamier dreams that o’er the glass</line>
      <line>Of shyly ripening woman-sense</line>
      <line>Reflected, scarce reflected, pass,</line>
      <line>A wife may-be, a mother she</line>
      <line>In Hymen’s shrine recalls not now,</line>
      <line>She first in hour, ah, not profane,</line>
      <line>With me to Hymen learnt to bow.</line>

      <line>Ah no!—Yet owned we, fused in one,</line>
      <line>The Power which e’en in stones and earths</line>
      <line>By blind elections felt, in forms</line>
      <line>Organic breeds to myriad births;</line>
      <line>By lichen small on granite wall</line>
      <line>Approved, its faintest feeblest stir</line>

      <line>Its sheeny primrose spangles spread,</line>
      <line>In roof o’er roof of shade sun-proof</line>
      <line>Did cedar strong itself outclimb,</line>

      <line>Aspire in floreal crown sublime;</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Flashed flickering forth fantastic flies,</line>
      <line>Big bees their burly bodies swung,</line>
      <line>Rooks roused with civic din the elms,</line>
      <line>And lark its wild reveillez rung;</line>
      <line>In Libyan dell the light gazelle,</line>
      <line>The leopard lithe in Indian glade,</line>
      <line>And dolphin, brightening tropic seas,</line>
      <line>In us were living, leapt and played:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Their shells did slow Crustacea build,</line>
      <line>Their gilded skins did snakes renew,</line>
      <line>While mightier spines for loftier kind</line>
      <line>Their types in amplest limbs outgrew;</line>
      <line>Yea, close comprest in human breast,</line>
      <line>What moss, and tree, and livelier thing,</line>
      <line>What Earth, Sun, Star of force possest,</line>
      <line>Lay budding, burgeoning forth for Spring.</line>

      <line>Such sweet preluding sense of old</line>
      <line>Led on in Eden’s sinless place</line>
      <line>The hour when bodies human first</line>
      <line>Combined the primal prime embrace,</line>
      <line>Such genial heat the blissful seat</line>
      <line>In man and woman owned unblamed,</line>
      <line>When, naked both, its garden paths</line>
      <line>They walked unconscious, unashamed:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ere, clouded yet in mistiest dawn,</line>
      <line>Above the horizon dusk and dun,</line>
      <line>One mountain crest with light had tipped</line>
      <line>That Orb that is the Spirit’s Sun;</line>
      <line>Ere dreamed young flowers in vernal showers</line>
      <line>Of fruit to rise the flower above,</line>

      <line>Was told the mystic name of Love.</line>

      <line>’Tis but to prove limitation, and measure a cord, that we travel;</line>

      <line>Dear Eustatio, I write that you may write me an answer,</line>
      <line>Or at the least to put us again en rapport with each other.</line>
      <line>Rome disappoints me much,—St Peter’s, perhaps, in especial;</line>
      <line>Only the Arch of Titus and view from the Lateran please me:</line>
      <line>This, however, perhaps, is the weather, which truly is horrid.</line>
      <line>Greece must be better, surely; and yet I am feeling so spiteful,</line>
      <line>That I could travel to Athens, to Delphi, and Troy, and Mount Sinai,</line>
      <line>Though but to see with my eyes that these are vanity also.</line>
      <line>Rome disappoints me much; I hardly as yet understand, but</line>
      <line>Rubbishy seems the word that most exactly would suit it.</line>
      <line>All the foolish destructions, and all the sillier savings,</line>
      <line>All the incongruous things of past incompatible ages,</line>
      <line>Seem to be treasured up here to make fools of present and future.</line>
      <line>Would to Heaven the old Goths had made a cleaner sweep of it!</line>
      <line>Would to Heaven some new ones would come and destroy these churches!</line>
      <line>However, one can live in Rome as also in London.</line>
      <line>Rome is better than London, because it is other than London.</line>
      <line>It is a blessing, no doubt, to be rid, at least for a time, of</line>
      <line>All one’s friends and relations,—yourself (forgive me!) included,—</line>
      <line>All the assujettissement of having been what one has been,</line>
      <line>What one thinks one is, or thinks that others suppose one;</line>
      <line>Yet, in despite of all, we turn like fools to the English.</line>
      <line>Vernon has been my fate; who is here the same that you knew him,—</line>
      <line>Making the tour, it seems, with friends of the name of Trevellyn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Rome disappoints me still; but I shrink and adapt myself to it.</line>
      <line>Somehow a tyrannous sense of a superincumbent oppression</line>
      <line>Still, wherever I go, accompanies ever, and makes me</line>
      <line>Feel like a tree (shall I say?) buried under a ruin of brick-work.</line>
      <line>Rome, believe me, my friend, is like its own Monte Testaceo,</line>
      <line>Merely a marvellous mass of broken and castaway wine-pots.</line>
      <line>Ye gods! what do I want with this rubbish of ages departed,</line>
      <line>Things that Nature abhors, the experiments that she has failed in?</line>
      <line>What do I find in the Forum? An archway and two or three pillars.</line>
      <line>Well, but St Peter’s? Alas, Bernini has filled it with sculpture!</line>
      <line>No one can cavil, I grant, at the size of the great Coliseum.</line>
      <line>Doubtless the notion of grand and capacious and massive amusement,</line>
      <line>This the old Romans had; but tell me, is this an idea?</line>
      <line>Yet of solidity much, but of splendour little is extant:</line>
      <line>‘Brickwork I found thee, and marble I left thee!’ their Emperor vaunted;</line>
      <line>‘Marble I thought thee, and brickwork I find thee!’ the Tourist may answer.</line>

      <line>At last, dearest Louisa, I take up my pen to address you.</line>
      <line>Here we are, you see, with the seven-and-seventy boxes,</line>
      <line>Courier, Papa and Mamma, the children, and Mary and Susan:</line>
      <line>Here we all are at Rome, and delighted of course with St Peter’s,</line>
      <line>And very pleasantly lodged in the famous Piazza di Spagna.</line>
      <line>Rome is a wonderful place, but Mary shall tell you about it;</line>
      <line>Not very gay, however; the English are mostly at Naples;</line>
      <line>There are the A.s, we hear, and most of the W. party.</line>
      <line>George, however, is come; did I tell you about his mustachios?</line>
      <line>Dear, I must really stop, for the carriage, they tell me, is waiting.</line>
      <line>Mary will finish; and Susan is writing, they say, to Sophia.</line>
      <line>Adieu, dearest Louise,—evermore your faithful Georgina.</line>
      <line>Who can a Mr Claude be whom George has taken to be with?</line>
      <line>Very stupid, I think, but George says so very clever.</line>

      <line>No, the Christian faith, as at any rate I understood it,</line>
      <line>With its humiliations and exaltations combining,</line>
      <line>Exaltations sublime, and yet diviner abasements,</line>
      <line>Aspirations from something most shameful here upon earth and</line>
      <line>In our poor selves to something most perfect above in the heavens,—</line>
      <line>No, the Christian faith, as I, at least, understood it,</line>
      <line>Is not here, O Rome, in any of these thy churches;</line>
      <line>Is not here, but in Freiburg, or Rheims, or Westminster Abbey.</line>
      <line>What in thy Dome I find, in all thy recenter efforts,</line>
      <line>Is a something, I think, more rational far, more earthly,</line>
      <line>Actual, less ideal, devout not in scorn and refusal,</line>
      <line>But in a positive, calm, Stoic-Epicurean acceptance.</line>
      <line>This I begin to detect in St Peter’s and some of the churches,</line>
      <line>Mostly in all that I see of the sixteenth-century masters;</line>
      <line>Overlaid of course with infinite gauds and gewgaws,</line>
      <line>Innocent, playful follies, the toys and trinkets of childhood,</line>
      <line>Forced on maturer years, as the serious one thing needful,</line>
      <line>By the barbarian will of the rigid and ignorant Spaniard.</line>
      <line>Curious work, meantime, re-entering society; how we</line>
      <line>Walk a livelong day, great Heaven, and watch our shadows!</line>
      <line>What our shadows seem, forsooth, we will ourselves be.</line>
      <line>Do I look like that? you think me that: then I am that.</line>

      <line>Luther, they say, was unwise; like a half-taught German, he could not</line>

      <line>Leo the Tenth was employing all efforts to clear out abuses;</line>
      <line>Jupiter, Juno, and Venus, Fine Arts, and Fine Letters, the Poets,</line>
      <line>Scholars, and Sculptors, and Painters, were quietly clearing away the</line>
      <line>Martyrs, and Virgins, and Saints, or at any rate Thomas Aquinas:</line>
      <line>He must forsooth make a fuss and distend his huge Wittenberg lungs, and</line>
      <line>Bring back Theology once yet again in a flood upon Europe:</line>
      <line>Lo you, for forty days from the windows of heaven it fell; the</line>
      <line>Waters prevail on the earth yet more for a hundred and fifty;</line>
      <line>Are they abating at last? the doves that are sent to explore are</line>
      <line>Wearily fain to return, at the best with a leaflet of promise,—</line>
      <line>Fain to return, as they went, to the wandering wave-tost vessel,—</line>
      <line>Fain to re-enter the roof which covers the clean and the unclean,—</line>
      <line>Luther, they say, was unwise; he didn’t see how things were going;</line>

      <line>O my tolerant soul, be still! but you talk of barbarians,</line>
      <line>Alaric, Attila, Genseric;—why, they came, they killed, they</line>
      <line>Ravaged, and went on their way; but these vile, tyrannous Spaniards,</line>
      <line>These are here still,—how long, O ye Heavens, in the country of Dante?</line>
      <line>These, that fanaticized Europe, which now can forget them, release not</line>
      <line>This, their choicest of prey, this Italy; here you see them,—</line>
      <line>Here, with emasculate pupils, and gimcrack churches of Gesu,</line>
      <line>Pseudo-learning and lies, confessional-boxes and postures,—</line>
      <line>Here, with metallic beliefs and regimental devotions,—</line>

      <line>Which of three Misses Trevellyn is it that Vernon shall marry</line>
      <line>Is not a thing to be known; for our friend is one of those natures</line>

      <line>Not that I like them much or care a bajocco for Vernon,</line>

      <line>So in fantastic height, in coxcomb exaltation,</line>

      <line>Or on a bench as I sit and abide for long hours, till thy whole vast</line>
      <line>Round grows dim as in dreams to my eyes, I repeople thy niches,</line>
      <line>Not with the Martyrs, and Saints, and Confessors, and Virgins, and children,</line>
      <line>But with the mightier forms of an older, austerer worship;</line>
      <line>And I recite to myself, how</line>
      <line>Eager for battle here</line>
      <line>Stood Vulcan, here matronal Juno,</line>
      <line>And with the bow to his shoulder faithful</line>
      <line>He who with pure dew laveth of Castaly</line>
      <line>His flowing locks, who holdeth of Lycia</line>
      <line>The oak forest and the wood that bore him,</line>
      <line>Delos’ and Patara’s own Apollo.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet it is pleasant, I own it, to be in their company; pleasant,</line>
      <line>Whatever else it may be, to abide in the feminine presence.</line>
      <line>Pleasant, but wrong, will you say? But this happy, serene coexistence</line>
      <line>Is to some poor soft souls, I fear, a necessity simple,</line>
      <line>Meat and drink and life, and music, filling with sweetness,</line>
      <line>Thrilling with melody sweet, with harmonies strange overwhelming,</line>
      <line>All the long-silent strings of an awkward, meaningless fabric.</line>
      <line>Yet as for that, I could live, I believe, with children; to have those</line>
      <line>Pure and delicate forms encompassing, moving about you,</line>
      <line>This were enough, I could think; and truly with glad resignation</line>
      <line>Could from the dream of romance, from the fever of flushed adolescence,</line>
      <line>Look to escape and subside into peaceful avuncular functions.</line>
      <line>Nephews and nieces! alas, for as yet I have none! and, moreover,</line>
      <line>Mothers are jealous, I fear me, too often, too rightfully; fathers</line>
      <line>Think they have title exclusive to spoiling their own little darlings;</line>
      <line>And by the law of the land, in despite of Malthusian doctrine,</line>
      <line>No sort of proper provision is made for that most patriotic,</line>
      <line>Most meritorious subject, the childless and bachelor uncle.</line>

      <line>Ye, too, marvellous Twain, that erect on. the Monte Cavallo</line>

      <line>Am I to turn me for this unto thee, great Chapel of Sixtus?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>These are the facts. The uncle, the elder brother, the squire (a</line>
      <line>Little embarrassed, I fancy), resides in a family place in</line>
      <line>Cornwall, of course; ‘Papa is in business,’ Mary informs me;</line>
      <line>He’s a good sensible man, whatever his trade is. The mother</line>
      <line>Is—shall I call it fine?—herself she would tell you refined, and</line>
      <line>Greatly, I fear me, looks down on my bookish and maladroit manners;</line>
      <line>Somewhat affecteth the blue; would talk to me often of poets;</line>
      <line>Quotes, which I hate, Childe Harold; but also appreciates Wordsworth;</line>
      <line>Sometimes adventures on Schiller; and then to religion diverges;</line>
      <line>Questions me much about Oxford; and yet, in her loftiest flights, still</line>
      <line>Grates the fastidious ear with the slightly mercantile accent.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Is it contemptible, Eustace,—I’m perfectly ready to think so,—</line>
      <line>Is it,—the horrible pleasure of pleasing inferior people?</line>
      <line>I am ashamed my own self; and yet true it is, if disgraceful,</line>
      <line>That for the first time in life I am living and moving with freedom.</line>
      <line>I, who never could talk to the people I meet with my uncle,—</line>
      <line>I, who have always failed,—I, trust me, can suit the Trevellyns;</line>
      <line>I, believe me,—great conquest,—am liked by the country bankers.</line>
      <line>And I am glad to be liked, and like in return very kindly.</line>
      <line>So it proceeds; Laissez faire, laissez alter,—such is the watchword.</line>
      <line>Well, I know there are thousands as pretty and hundreds as pleasant,</line>
      <line>Girls by the dozen as good, and girls in abundance with polish</line>
      <line>Higher and manners more perfect than Susan or Mary Trevellyn.</line>
      <line>Well, I know, after all, it is only juxtaposition,—</line>
      <line>Juxtaposition, in short; and what is juxtaposition?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But I am in for it now,—laissez faire, of a truth, laissez alter.</line>
      <line>Yes, I am going,—I feel it, I feel and cannot recall it,—</line>
      <line>Fusing with this thing and that, entering into all sorts of relations,</line>
      <line>Tying I know not what ties, which, whatever they are, I know one thing,</line>
      <line>Will, and must, woe is me, be one day painfully broken,—</line>
      <line>Broken with painful remorses, with shrinkings of soul, and relentings,</line>
      <line>Foolish delays, more foolish evasions, most foolish renewals.</line>
      <line>But I have made the step, have quitted the ship of Ulysses;</line>
      <line>Quitted the sea and the shore, passed into the magical island;</line>
      <line>Yet on my lips is the moly, medicinal, offered of Hermes.</line>
      <line>I have come into the precinct, the labyrinth closes around me,</line>
      <line>Path into path rounding slyly; I pace slowly on, and the fancy,</line>
      <line>Struggling awhile to sustain the long sequences, weary, bewildered,</line>
      <line>Fain must collapse in despair; I yield, I am lost and know nothing;</line>
      <line>Yet in my bosom unbroken remaineth the clew; I shall use it.</line>
      <line>Lo, with the rope on my loins I descend through the fissure; I sink, yet</line>
      <line>Inly secure in the strength of invisible arms up above me;</line>
      <line>Still, wheresoever I swing, wherever to shore, or to shelf, or</line>
      <line>Floor of cavern untrodden, shell-sprinkled, enchanting, I know I</line>
      <line>Yet shall one time feel the strong cord tighten about me,—</line>

      <line>Rope sway wildly, I faint, crags wound me, from crag unto crag re-</line>
      <line>Bounding, or, wide in the void, I die ten deaths, ere the end I</line>
      <line>Yet shall plant firm foot on the broad lofty spaces I quit, shall</line>

      <line>Dearest Louisa,—Inquire, if you please, about Mr Claude-.</line>
      <line>He has been once at R., and remembers meeting the H.s.</line>
      <line>Harriet L., perhaps, may be able to tell you about him.</line>
      <line>It is an awkward youth, but still with very good manners;</line>
      <line>Not without prospects, we hear; and, George says, highly connected.</line>
      <line>Georgy declares it absurd, but Mamma is alarmed, and insists he has</line>
      <line>Taken up strange opinions and may be turning a Papist.</line>
      <line>Certainly once he spoke of a daily service he went to.</line>
      <line>‘Where?’ we asked, and he laughed and answered, ‘At the Pantheon.’</line>
      <line>This was a temple, you know, and now is a Catholic church; and</line>
      <line>Though it is said that Mazzini has sold it for Protestant service,</line>

      <line>I do not like him much, though I do not dislike being with him.</line>
      <line>He is what people call, I suppose, a superior man, and</line>

      <line>Beautiful can I not call thee, and yet thou hast power to o’ermaster,</line>

      <line>On the whole, we are meant to look after ourselves; it is certain</line>
      <line>Each has to eat for himself, digest for himself, and in general</line>
      <line>Care for his own dear life, and see to his own preservation;</line>
      <line>Nature’s intentions, in most things uncertain, in this most plain are decisive;</line>

      <line>Quit our own fireside hopes at the alien call of a neighbour,</line>

      <line>Yes, we are fighting at last, it appears. This morning as usual,</line>
      <line>Murray, as usual, in hand, I enter the Caffe Nuovo;</line>
      <line>Seating myself with a sense as it were of a change in the weather,</line>
      <line>Not understanding, however, but thinking mostly of Murray,</line>
      <line>And, for to-day is their day, of the Campidoglio Marbles,</line>
      <line>Caffe-latte! I call to the waiter,—and Non c’ e latte,</line>
      <line>This is the answer he makes me, and this the sign of a battle.</line>
      <line>So I sit; and truly they seem to think any one else more</line>
      <line>Worthy than me of attention. I wait for my milkless nero,</line>
      <line>Free to observe undistracted all sorts and sizes of persons,</line>
      <line>Blending civilian and soldier in strangest costume, coming in, and</line>
      <line>Gulping in hottest haste, still standing, their coffee,—withdrawing</line>
      <line>Eagerly, jangling a sword on the steps, or jogging a musket</line>
      <line>Slung to the shoulder behind. They are fewer, moreover, than usual,</line>
      <line>Much, and silenter far; and so I begin to imagine</line>
      <line>Something is really afloat. Ere I leave, the Caffe is empty,</line>
      <line>Empty too the streets, in all its length the Corso</line>
      <line>Empty, and empty I see to my right and left the Condotti.</line>
      <line>Twelve o’clock, on the Pincian Hill, with lots of English,</line>
      <line>Germans, Americans, French,—the Frenchmen, too, are protected,—</line>
      <line>So we stand in the sun, but afraid of a probable shower;</line>
      <line>So we stand and stare, and see, to the left of St Peter’s,</line>
      <line>Smoke, from the cannon, white,—but that is at intervals only,—</line>
      <line>Black, from a burning house, we suppose, by the Cavalleggieri;</line>
      <line>And we believe we discern some lines of men descending</line>
      <line>Down through the vineyard-slopes, and catch a bayonet gleaming.</line>
      <line>Every ten minutes, however,—in this there is no misconception,—</line>
      <line>Comes a great white puff from behind Michel Angelo’s dome, and</line>
      <line>After a space the report of a real big gun,—not the Frenchman’s?—</line>
      <line>That must be doing some work. And so we watch and conjecture.</line>
      <line>Shortly, an Englishman comes, who says he has been to St Peter’s,</line>
      <line>Seen the Piazza and troops, but that is all he can tell us;</line>
      <line>So we watch and sit, and, indeed, it begins to be tiresome.—</line>
      <line>All this smoke is outside; when it has come to the inside,</line>
      <line>It will be time, perhaps, to descend and retreat to our houses.</line>
      <line>Half past one, or two. The report of small arms frequent,</line>
      <line>Sharp and savage indeed; that cannot all be for nothing:</line>
      <line>So we watch and wonder; but guessing is tiresome, very.</line>
      <line>Weary of wondering, watching, and guessing, and gossiping idly,</line>
      <line>Down I go, and pass through the quiet streets with the knots of</line>
      <line>National Guards patrolling, and flags hanging out at the windows,</line>
      <line>English, American, Danish,—and, after offering to help an</line>
      <line>Irish family moving en masse to the Maison Serny,</line>
      <line>After endeavouring idly to minister balm to the trembling</line>
      <line>Quinquagenarian fears of two lone British spinsters,</line>
      <line>Go to make sure of my dinner before the enemy enter.</line>
      <line>But by this there are signs of stragglers returning; and voices</line>
      <line>Talk, though you don’t believe it, of guns and prisoners taken;</line>
      <line>And on the walls you read the first bulletin of the morning.—</line>
      <line>This is all that I saw, and all I know of the battle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Victory! Victory!—Yes! ah, yes, thou republican Zion,</line>
      <line>Truly the kings of the earth are gathered and gone by together;</line>
      <line>Doubtless they marvelled to witness such things, were astonished, and so forth.</line>
      <line>Victory! Victory! Victory!—Ah, but it is, believe me,</line>
      <line>Easier, easier far, to intone the chant of the martyr</line>
      <line>Than to indite any paean of any victory. Death may</line>
      <line>Sometimes be noble; but life, at the best, will appear an illusion.</line>
      <line>While the great pain is upon us, it is great; when it is over,</line>
      <line>Why, it is over. The smoke of the sacrifice rises to heaven,</line>
      <line>Of a sweet savour, no doubt, to Somebody; but on the altar,</line>
      <line>Lo, there is nothing remaining but ashes and dirt and ill odour.</line>
      <line>So it stands, you perceive; the labial muscles, that swelled with</line>
      <line>Vehement evolution of yesterday Marseillaises,</line>
      <line>Articulations sublime of defiance and scorning, to-day col-</line>
      <line>Lapse and languidly mumble, while men and women and papers</line>
      <line>Scream and re-scream to each other the chorus of Victory. Well, but</line>

      <line>So, I have seen a man killed! An experience that, among others!</line>

      <line>But a man was killed, I am told, in a place where I saw</line>
      <line>Something; a man was killed, I am told, and I saw something.</line>
      <line>I was returning home from St Peter’s; Murray, as usual,</line>
      <line>Under my arm, I remember; had crossed the St Angelo bridge; and</line>
      <line>Moving towards the Condotti, had got to the first barricade, when</line>
      <line>Gradually, thinking still of St Peter’s, I became conscious</line>
      <line>Of a sensation of movement opposing me,—tendency this way</line>
      <line>(Such as one fancies may be in a stream when the wave of the tide is</line>
      <line>Coming and not yet come,—a sort of poise and retention);</line>
      <line>So I turned, and, before I turned, caught sight of stragglers</line>
      <line>Heading a crowd, it is plain, that is coming behind that corner.</line>
      <line>Looking up, I see windows filled with heads; the Piazza,</line>
      <line>Into which you remember the Ponte St Angelo enters,</line>
      <line>Since I passed, has thickened with curious groups; and now the</line>
      <line>Crowd is coming, has turned, has crossed that last barricade, is</line>
      <line>Here at my side. In the middle they drag at something. What is it?</line>
      <line>Ha! bare swords in the air, held up! There seem to be voices</line>
      <line>Pleading and hands putting back; official, perhaps; but the swords are</line>
      <line>Many, and bare in the air. In the air? They descend; they are smiting</line>
      <line>Hewing, chopping—At what? In the air once more upstretched! And</line>
      <line>Is it blood that’s on them? Yes, certainly blood! Of whom, then?</line>
      <line>Over whom is the cry of this furor of exultation?</line>
      <line>While they are skipping and screaming, and dancing their caps on</line>
      <line>the points of</line>
      <line>Swords and bayonets, I to the outskirts back, and ask a</line>
      <line>Mercantile-seeming by-stander, ‘What is it?’ and he, looking always</line>
      <line>That way, makes me answer, ‘A Priest, who was trying to fly to</line>
      <line>The Neapolitan army,’—and thus explains the proceeding.</line>
      <line>You didn’t see the dead man? No;—I began to be doubtful;</line>
      <line>I was in black myself, and didn’t know what mightn’t happen;—</line>
      <line>But a National Guard close by me, outside of the hubbub,</line>
      <line>Broke his sword with slashing a broad hat covered with dust,—and</line>
      <line>Passing away from the place with Murray under my arm, and</line>
      <line>Stooping, I saw through the legs of the people the legs of a body.</line>
      <line>You are the first, do you know, to whom I have mentioned the matter.</line>
      <line>Whom should I tell it to, else?—these girls?—the Heavens forbid it!—</line>
      <line>Quidnuncs at Monaldini’s?—idlers upon the Pincian?</line>
      <line>If I rightly remember, it happened on that afternoon when</line>
      <line>Word of the nearer approach of a new Neapolitan army</line>
      <line>First was spread. I began to bethink me of Paris Septembers,</line>
      <line>Thought I could fancy the look of the old ’Ninety-two. On that evening</line>
      <line>Three or four, or, it may be, five, of these people were slaughtered.</line>
      <line>Some declare they had, one of them, fired on a sentinel; others</line>
      <line>Say they were only escaping; a Priest, it is currendy stated,</line>
      <line>Stabbed a National Guard on the very Piazza Colonna:</line>
      <line>History, Rumour of Rumours, I leave it to thee to determine!</line>
      <line>But I am thankful to say the government seems to have strength to</line>
      <line>Put it down; it has vanished, at least; the place is most peaceful.</line>
      <line>Through the Trastevere walking last night, at nine of the clock, I</line>
      <line>Found no sort of disorder; I crossed by the Island-bridges,</line>
      <line>So by the narrow streets to the Ponte Rotto, and onwards</line>
      <line>Thence, by the Temple of Vesta, away to the great Coliseum,</line>
      <line>Which at the full of the moon is an object worthy a visit.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Only think, dearest Louisa, what fearful scenes we have witnessed!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>George has just seen Garibaldi, dressed up in a long white cloak, on</line>
      <line>Horseback, riding by, with his mounted negro behind him:</line>
      <line>This is a man, you know, who came from America with him,</line>
      <line>Out of the woods, I suppose, and uses a lasso in fighting,</line>
      <line>Which is, I don’t quite know, but a sort of noose, I imagine;</line>
      <line>This he throws on the heads of the enemy’s men in a battle,</line>
      <line>Pulls them into his reach, and then most cruelly kills them:</line>
      <line>Mary does not believe, but we heard it from an Italian.</line>
      <line>Mary allows she was wrong about Mr Claude being selfish;</line>
      <line>He was most useful and kind on the terrible thirtieth of April.</line>
      <line>Do not write here any more; we are starting directly for Florence:</line>
      <line>We should be off to-morrow, if only Papa could get horses;</line>
      <line>All have been seized everywhere for the use of this dreadful Mazzini.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>P.S.</line>
      <line>Mary has seen thus far.—I am really so angry, Louisa,—</line>
      <line>Quite out of patience, my dearest! What can the man be intending!</line>
      <line>I am quite tired; and Mary, who might bring him to in a moment,</line>
      <line>Lets him go on as he likes, and neither will help nor dismiss him.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is most curious to see what a power a few calm words (in</line>
      <line>Merely a brief proclamation) appear to possess on the people.</line>
      <line>Order is perfect, and peace; the city is utterly tranquil;</line>
      <line>And one cannot conceive that this easy and nonchalant crowd, that</line>
      <line>Flows like a quiet stream through street and market-place, entering</line>
      <line>Shady recesses and bays of church, osteria, and caffe,</line>
      <line>Could in a moment be changed to a flood as of molten lava,</line>
      <line>Boil into deadly wrath and wild homicidal delusion.</line>
      <line>Ah, ’tis an excellent race,—and even in old degradation,</line>
      <line>Under a rule that enforces to flattery, lying, and cheating,</line>
      <line>E’en under Pope and Priest, a nice and natural people.</line>
      <line>Oh, could they but be allowed this chance of redemption!—but clearly</line>
      <line>That is not likely to be. Meantime, notwithstanding all journals,</line>
      <line>Honour for once to the tongue and the pen of the eloquent writer!</line>
      <line>Honour to speech! and all honour to thee, thou noble Mazzini!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I AM in love, meantime, you think; no doubt you would think so.</line>
      <line>I am in love, you say; with those letters, of course, you would say so.</line>
      <line>I am in love, you declare. I think not so; yet I grant you</line>
      <line>It is a pleasure, indeed, to converse with this girl. Oh, rare gift,</line>
      <line>Rare felicity, this! she can talk in a rational way, can</line>
      <line>Speak upon subjects that really are matters of mind and of thinking,</line>
      <line>Yet in perfection retain her simplicity; never, one moment,</line>
      <line>Never, however you urge it, however you tempt her, consents to</line>
      <line>Step from ideas and fancies and loving sensations to those vain</line>
      <line>Conscious understandings that vex the minds of man-kind.</line>
      <line>No, though she talk, it is music; her fingers desert not the keys; ’tis</line>
      <line>Song, though you hear in the song the articulate vocables sounded,</line>
      <line>Syllabled singly and sweetly the words of melodious meaning.</line>
      <line>I am in love, you say; I do not think so exactly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There are two different kinds, I believe, of human attraction:</line>
      <line>One which simply disturbs, unsettles, and makes you uneasy,</line>
      <line>And another that poises, retains, and fixes and holds you.</line>
      <line>I have no doubt, for myself, in giving my voice for the latter.</line>
      <line>I do not wish to be moved, but growing where I was growing,</line>
      <line>There more truly to grow, to live where as yet I had languished.</line>
      <line>I do not like being moved: for the will is excited; and action</line>
      <line>Is a most dangerous thing; I tremble for something factitious,</line>
      <line>Some malpractice of heart and illegitimate process;</line>
      <line>We are so prone to these things with our terrible notions of duty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, let me look, let me watch, let m£ wait, unhurried, unprompted!</line>
      <line>Bid me not venture on aught that could alter or end what is present!</line>
      <line>Say not, Time flies, and Occasion, that never returns, is departing!</line>
      <line>Drive me not out, ye ill angels with fiery swords, from my Eden,</line>
      <line>Waiting, and watching, and looking! Let love be its own inspiration!</line>
      <line>Shall not a voice, if a voice there must be, from the airs that environ,</line>
      <line>Yea, from the conscious heavens, without our knowledge or effort,</line>
      <line>Break into audible words? and love be its own inspiration?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wherefore and how I am certain, I hardly can tell; but it is so.</line>
      <line>She doesn’t like me, Eustace; I think she never will like me.</line>
      <line>Is it my fault, as it is my misfortune, my ways are not her ways?</line>
      <line>Is it my fault, that my habits and modes are dissimilar wholly?</line>
      <line>’Tis not her fault, ’tis her nature, her virtue, to misapprehend them:</line>
      <line>’Tis not her fault, ’tis her beautiful nature, not ever to know me.</line>
      <line>Hopeless it seems,—yet I cannot, though hopeless, determine to leave it:</line>
      <line>She goes,—therefore I go; she moves,—I move, not to lose her.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, ’tisn’t manly, of course, ’tisn’t manly, this method of wooing;</line>
      <line>’Tisn’t the way very likely to win. For the woman, they tell you,</line>
      <line>Ever prefers the audacious, the wilful, the vehement hero;</line>
      <line>She has no heart for the timid, the sensitive soul; and for knowledge,—</line>
      <line>Knowledge, O ye Gods!—when did they appreciate knowledge?</line>
      <line>Wherefore should they, either? I am sure I do not desire it.</line>
      <line>Ah, and I feel too, Eustace, she cares not a tittle about me!</line>
      <line>(Care about me, indeed! and do I really expect it?)</line>
      <line>But my manner offends; my ways are wholly repugnant;</line>
      <line>Every word that I utter estranges, hurts, and repels her;</line>
      <line>Every moment of bliss that I gain, in her exquisite presence,</line>
      <line>Slowly, surely, withdraws her, removes her, and severs her from me.</line>
      <line>Not that I care very much!—any way, I escape from the boy’s own</line>
      <line>Folly, to which I am prone, of loving where it is easy.</line>
      <line>Not that I mind very much! Why should I? I am not in love, and</line>
      <line>Am prepared, I think, if not by previous habit,</line>
      <line>Yet in the spirit beforehand for this and all that is like it;</line>
      <line>It is an easier matter for us contemplative creatures,</line>
      <line>Us, upon whom the pressure of action is laid so lightly;</line>
      <line>We discontented indeed with things in particular, idle,</line>
      <line>Sickly, complaining, by faith in the vision of things in general,</line>
      <line>Manage to hold on our way without, like others around us,</line>
      <line>Seizing the nearest arm to comfort, help, and support us.</line>
      <line>Yet, after all, my Eustace, I know but little about it.</line>
      <line>All I can say for myself, for present alike and for past, is,</line>
      <line>Mary Trevellyn, Eustace, is certainly worth your acquaintance.</line>
      <line>You couldn’t come, I suppose, as far as Florence, to see her?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To-morrow we’re starting for Florence,</line>
      <line>Truly rejoiced, you may guess, to escape from republican terrors;</line>
      <line>Mr C. and Papa to escort us; we by vettura</line>
      <line>Through Siena, and Georgy to follow and join us by Leghorn.</line>
      <line>Then-Ah, what shall I say, my dearest? I tremble in thinking!</line>
      <line>You will imagine my feelings,—the blending of hope and of sorrow!</line>
      <line>How can I bear to abandon Papa and Mamma and my Sisters?</line>
      <line>Dearest Louisa, indeed it is very alarming; but trust me</line>
      <line>Ever, whatever may change, to remain your loving Georgina.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Do I like Mr Claude any better?’</line>
      <line>I am to tell you,—and, ‘Pray, is it Susan or I that attract him?’</line>
      <line>This he never has told, but Georgina could certainly ask him.</line>
      <line>All I can say for myself is, alas! that he rather repels me.</line>
      <line>There! I think him agreeable, but also a little repulsive.</line>
      <line>So be content, dear Louisa; for one satisfactory marriage</line>
      <line>Surely will do in one year for the family you would establish;</line>
      <line>Neither Susan nor I shall afford you the joy of a second.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mr Claude, you must know, is behaving a little bit better;</line>
      <line>He and Papa are great friends; but he really is too shilly-shally —</line>
      <line>So unlike George! Yet I hope that the matter is going on fairly.</line>
      <line>I shall, however, get George, before he goes, to say something.</line>
      <line>Dearest Louisa, how delightful, to bring young people together!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is it to Florence we follow, or are we to tarry yet longer,</line>
      <line>E'en amid clamour of arms, here in the city of old,</line>
      <line>Seeking from clamour of arms in the Past and the Arts to be hidden,</line>
      <line>Vainly 'mid Arts and the Past seeking one life to forget?</line>
      <line>Ah, fair shadow, scarce seen, go forth! for anon he shall follow,—</line>
      <line>He that beheld thee, anon, whither thou leadest, must go!</line>
      <line>Go, and the wise, loving Muse, she also will follow and find thee!</line>
      <line>She, should she linger in Rome, were not dissevered from thee!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet to the wondrous St Peter's, and yet to the solemn Rotonda,</line>
      <line>Mingling with heroes and gods, yet to the Vatican walls,</line>
      <line>Yet may we go, and recline, while a whole mighty world seems above us</line>
      <line>Gathered and fixed to all time into one roofing supreme;</line>
      <line>Yet may we, thinking on these things, exclude what is meaner around us;</line>
      <line>Yet, at the worst of the worst, books and a chamber remain;</line>
      <line>Yet may we think, and forget, and possess our souls in resistance.—</line>
      <line>Ah, but away from the stir, shouting, and gossip of war,</line>
      <line>Where, upon Apennine slope, with the chestnut the oak-trees immingle,</line>
      <line>Where amid odorous copse bridle-paths wander and wind,</line>
      <line>Where under mulberry-branches the diligent rivulet sparkles,</line>
      <line>Or amid cotton and maize peasants their waterworks ply,</line>
      <line>Where, over fig-tree and orange in tier upon tier still repeated,</line>
      <line>Garden on garden upreared, balconies step to the sky,—</line>
      <line>Ah, that I were, far away from the crowd and the streets of the city,</line>
      <line>Under the vine-trellis laid, 0 my beloved, with thee!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why doesn’t Mr Claude come with us? you ask.— We don’t know.</line>
      <line>You should know better than we. He talked of the Vatican marbles;</line>
      <line>But I can’t wholly believe that this was the actual reason,—</line>
      <line>He was so ready before, when we asked him to come and escort us.</line>
      <line>Certainly he is odd, my dear Miss Roper. To change so</line>
      <line>Suddenly, just for a whim, was not quite fair to the party,—</line>
      <line>Not quite right. I declare, I really almost am offended:</line>
      <line>I, his great friend, as you say, have doubtless a title to be so.</line>
      <line>Not that I greatly regret it, for dear Georgina distinctly</line>
      <line>Wishes for nothing so much as to show her adroitness. But, oh, my</line>
      <line>Pen will not write any more;—let us say nothing further about it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, my dear Miss Roper, I certainly called him repulsive;</line>
      <line>So I think him, but cannot be sure I have used the expression</line>
      <line>Quite as your pupil should; yet he does most truly repel me.</line>
      <line>Was it to you I made use of the word? or who was it told you?</line>
      <line>Yes, repulsive; observe, it is but when he talks of ideas,</line>
      <line>That he is quite unaffected, and free, and expansive, and easy;</line>
      <line>I could pronounce him simply a cold intellectual being.—</line>
      <line>When does he make advances?—He thinks that women should woo him;</line>
      <line>Yet, if a girl should do so, would be but alarmed and disgusted.</line>
      <line>She that should love him must look for small love in return,—like the ivy</line>
      <line>On the stone wall, must expect but a rigid and niggard support, and</line>
      <line>E’en to get that must go searching all round with her humble embraces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Tell me, my friend, do you think that the grain would sprout in the furrow,</line>
      <line>Did it not truly accept as its summum and ultimum bonum</line>
      <line>That mere common and may-be indifferent soil it is set in?</line>
      <line>Would it have force to develop and open its young cotyledons,</line>
      <line>Could it compare, and reflect, and examine one thing with another?</line>
      <line>Would it endure to accomplish the round of its natural functions,</line>
      <line>Were it endowed with a sense of the general scheme of existence?</line>
      <line>While from Marseilles in the steamer we voyaged to Civita Vecchia,</line>
      <line>Vexed in the squally seas as we lay by Capraja and Elba,</line>
      <line>Standing, uplifted, alone on the heaving poop of the vessel,</line>
      <line>Looking around on the waste of the rushing incurious billows,</line>
      <line>‘This is Nature,’ I said: ‘we are born as it were from her waters,</line>
      <line>Over her billows that buffet and beat us, her offspring uncared-for,</line>
      <line>Casting one single regard of a painful victorious knowledge,</line>
      <line>Into her billows that buffet and beat us we sink and are swallowed.’</line>
      <line>This was the sense in my soul, as I swayed with the poop of the steamer;</line>
      <line>And as unthinking I sat in the hall of the famed Ariadne,</line>
      <line>Lo, it looked at me there from the face of a Triton in marble.</line>
      <line>It is the simpler thought, and I can believe it the truer.</line>
      <line>Let us not talk of growth; we are still in our Aqueous Ages.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Farewell, Politics, utterly! What can I do? I cannot</line>
      <line>Fight, you know; and to talk I am wholly ashamed. And although I</line>
      <line>Gnash my teeth when I look in your French or your English papers,</line>
      <line>What is the good of that? Will swearing, I wonder, mend matters?</line>
      <line>Cursing and scolding repel the assailants? No, it is idle;</line>
      <line>No, whatever befalls, I will hide, will ignore or forget it.</line>
      <line>Let the tail shift for itself; I will bury my head. And what’s the</line>
      <line>Roman Republic to me, or I to the Roman Republic?</line>
      <line>Why not fight?—In the first place, I haven’t so much as a musket.</line>
      <line>In the next, if I had, I shouldn’t know how I should use it.</line>
      <line>In the third, just at present I’m studying ancient marbles.</line>
      <line>In the fourth, I consider I owe my life to my country.</line>
      <line>In the fifth,—I forget, but four good reasons are ample.</line>
      <line>Meantime, pray, let ’em fight, and be killed. I delight in devotion.</line>
      <line>So that I ’list not, hurrah for the glorious army of martyrs!</line>
      <line>Sanguis martyrum semen Ecclesice; though it would seem this</line>
      <line>Church is indeed of the purely Invisible, Kingdom-come kind:</line>
      <line>Militant here on earth! Triumphant, of course, then, elsewhere!</line>
      <line>Ah, good Heaven, but I would I were out far away from the pother!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not, as we read in the words of the olden-time inspiration,</line>
      <line>Are there two several trees in the place we are set to abide in;</line>
      <line>But on the apex most high of the Tree of Life in the Garden,</line>
      <line>Budding, unfolding, and falling, decaying and flowering ever,</line>
      <line>Flowering is set and decaying the transient blossom of Knowledge,—</line>
      <line>Flowering alone, and decaying, the needless, unfruitful blossom.</line>
      <line>Or as the cypress-spires by the fair-flowing stream Hellespontine,</line>
      <line>Which from the mythical tomb of the godlike Protesilaiis</line>
      <line>Rose sympathetic in grief to his lovelorn Laodamia,</line>
      <line>Evermore growing, and, when in their growth to the prospect attaining,</line>
      <line>Over the low sea-banks, of the fatal Ilian city,</line>
      <line>Withering still at the sight which still they upgrow to encounter.</line>
      <line>Ah, but ye that extrude from the ocean your helpless faces,</line>
      <line>Ye over stormy seas leading long and dreary processions,</line>
      <line>Ye, too, brood of the wind, whose coming is whence we discern not,</line>
      <line>Making your nest on the wave, and your bed on the crested billow,</line>
      <line>Skimming rough waters, and crowding wet sands that the tide shall return to,</line>
      <line>Cormorants, ducks, and gulls, fill ye my imagination!</line>
      <line>Let us not talk of growth; we are still in our Aqueous Ages.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dearest Miss Roper,—Alas! we are all at Florence quite safe, and</line>
      <line>You, we hear, are shut up! indeed, it is sadly distressing!</line>
      <line>We were most lucky, they say, to get off when we did from the troubles.</line>
      <line>Now you are really besieged! they tell us it soon will be over;</line>
      <line>Only I hope and trust without any fight in the city.</line>
      <line>Do you see Mr Claude?—I thought he might do something for you.</line>

      <line>Juxtaposition, in fine; and what is juxtaposition?</line>
      <line>Look you, we travel along in the railway-carriage, or steamer,</line>
      <line>And, pour passer le temps, till the tedious journey be ended,</line>
      <line>Lay aside paper or book, to talk with the girl that is next one;</line>
      <line>And, pour passer le temps, with the terminus all but in prospect,</line>
      <line>Talk of eternal ties and marriages made in heaven.</line>
      <line>Ah, did we really accept with a perfect heart the illusion!</line>
      <line>Ah, did we really believe that the Present indeed is the Only!</line>
      <line>Or through all transmutation, all shock and convulsion of passion,</line>
      <line>Feel we could carry undimmed, unextinguished, the light of our knowledge!</line>
      <line>But for his funeral train which the bridegroom sees in the distance,</line>
      <line>Would he so joyfully, think you, fall in with the marriage-procession?</line>
      <line>But for that final discharge, would he dare to enlist in that service?</line>
      <line>But for that certain release, ever sign to that perilous contract?</line>
      <line>But for that exit secure, ever bend to that treacherous doorway?—</line>
      <line>Ah, but the bride, meantime,—do you think she sees it as he does?</line>
      <line>But for the steady fore-sense of a freer and larger existence,</line>
      <line>Think you that man could consent to be circumscribed here into action?</line>
      <line>But for assurance within of a limitless ocean divine, o’er</line>
      <line>Whose great tranquil depths unconscious the wind-tost surface</line>
      <line>Breaks into ripples of trouble that come and change and endure not,—</line>
      <line>But that in this, of a truth, we have our being, and know it,</line>
      <line>Think you we men could submit to live and move as we do here?</line>
      <line>Ah, but the women,—God bless them!—they don’t think at all about it.</line>
      <line>Yet we must eat and drink, as you say. And as limited beings</line>
      <line>Scarcely can hope to attain upon earth to an Actual Abstract,</line>
      <line>Leaving to God contemplation, to His hands knowledge confiding,</line>
      <line>Sure that in us if it perish, in Him it abideth and dies not,</line>
      <line>Let us in His sight accomplish our petty particular doings,—</line>
      <line>Yes, and contented sit down to the victual that He has provided.</line>
      <line>Allah is great, no doubt, and Juxtaposition his prophet.</line>
      <line>Ah, but the women, alas! they don’t look at it in that way.</line>
      <line>Juxtaposition is great;—but, my friend, I fear me, the maiden</line>
      <line>Hardly would thank or acknowledge the lover that sought to obtain her,</line>
      <line>Not as the thing he would wish, but the thing he must even put up with,—</line>
      <line>Hardly would tender her hand to the wooer that candidly told her</line>
      <line>That she is but for a space, an ad-interim solace and pleasure,—</line>
      <line>That in the end she shall yield to a perfect and absolute something,</line>
      <line>Which I then for myself shall behold, and not another,—</line>
      <line>Which, amid fondest endearments, meantime I forget not, forsake not.</line>
      <line>Ah, ye feminine souls, so loving and so exacting,</line>
      <line>Since we cannot escape, must we even submit to deceive you?</line>
      <line>Since, so cruel is truth, sincerity shocks and revolts you,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Juxtaposition is great,—but, you tell me, affinity greater.</line>
      <line>Ah, my friend, there are many affinities, greater and lesser,</line>
      <line>Stronger and weaker; and each, by the favour of juxtaposition,</line>
      <line>Potent, efficient, in force,—for a time; but none, let me tell you,</line>
      <line>Save by the law of the land and the ruinous force of the will, ah,</line>
      <line>None, I fear me, at last quite sure to be final and perfect.</line>
      <line>Lo, as I pace in the street, from the peasant-girl to the princess,</line>
      <line>Homo sum, nihil humani a me alienum puto,—</line>
      <line>Vir sum, nihil fceminei,—and e’en to the uttermost circle,</line>
      <line>All that is Nature’s is I, and I all things that are Nature’s.</line>
      <line>Yes, as I walk, I behold, in a luminous, large intuition,</line>
      <line>That I can be and become anything that I meet with or look at:</line>
      <line>I am the ox in the dray, the ass with the garden-stuff panniers;</line>
      <line>I am the dog in the doorway, the kitten that plays in the window,</line>
      <line>On sunny slab of the ruin the furtive and fugitive lizard,</line>
      <line>Swallow above me that twitters, and fly that is buzzing about me;</line>
      <line>Yea, and detect, as I go, by a faint but a faithful assurance,</line>
      <line>E’en from the stones of the street, as from rocks or trees of the forest,</line>
      <line>Something of kindred, a common, though latent vitality, greet me;</line>
      <line>And, to escape from our strivings, mistakings, misgrowths, and perversions,</line>
      <line>Fain could demand to return to that perfect and primitive silence,</line>
      <line>Fain be enfolded and fixed, as of old, in their rigid embraces.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And as I walk on my way, I behold them consorting and coupling;</line>
      <line>Faithful it seemeth, and fond, very fond, very probably faithful;</line>
      <line>All as I go on my way, with a pleasure sincere and unmingled.</line>
      <line>Life is beautiful, Eustace, entrancing, enchanting to look at;</line>
      <line>As are the streets of a city we pace while the carriage is changing,</line>
      <line>As a chamber filled-in with harmonious, exquisite pictures,</line>
      <line>Even so beautiful Earth; and could we eliminate only</line>
      <line>This vile hungering impulse, this demon within us of craving,</line>
      <line>Life were beatitude, living a perfect divine satisfaction.</line>

      <line>Lo, with her calm eyes there she met me and knew nothing of it,—</line>

      <line>Dear Miss Roper,—It seems, George Vernon, before we left Rome, said</line>
      <line>Something to Mr Claude about what they call his attentions.</line>
      <line>Susan, two nights ago, for the first time, heard this from Georgina.</line>
      <line>It is so disagreeable and so annoying to think of!</line>
      <line>If it could only be known, though we may never meet him again, that</line>

      <line>It would extremely relieve—Your ever affectionate Mary.</line>

      <line>Here is your letter arrived this moment, just as I wanted.</line>
      <line>So you have seen him,—indeed,—and guessed,—how dreadfully clever!</line>

      <line>Charming!—but wait for a moment, I haven’t read through the letter.</line>

      <line>Ah, my dearest Miss Roper, do just as you fancy about it.</line>
      <line>If you think it sincerer to tell him I know of it, do so.</line>
      <line>Though I should most extremely dislike it, I know I could manage.</line>
      <line>It is the simplest thing, but surely wholly uncalled for.</line>
      <line>Do as you please; you know I trust implicitly to you.</line>
      <line>Say whatever is right and needful for ending the matter.</line>

      <line>It would be pleasanter far for myself to treat it exactly</line>

      <line>I must remember to add, that as soon as the wedding is over</line>
      <line>We shall be off, I believe, in a hurry, and travel to Milan,</line>
      <line>There to meet friends of Papa’s, I am told, at the Croce di Malta;</line>

      <line>Yes, on Montorio’s height for a last farewell of the city,—</line>
      <line>So it appears; though then I was quite uncertain about it.</line>
      <line>So, however, it was. And now to explain the proceeding.</line>
      <line>I was to go, as I told you, I think, with the people to Florence.</line>
      <line>Only the day before, the foolish family Vernon</line>
      <line>Made some uneasy remarks, as we walked to our lodging together,</line>
      <line>As to intentions, forsooth, and so forth. I was astounded,</line>
      <line>Horrified quite; and obtaining just then, as it happened, an offer</line>
      <line>(No common favour) of seeing the great Ludovisi collection,</line>
      <line>Why, I made this a pretence, and wrote that they must excuse me.</line>
      <line>How could I go? Great Heaven! to conduct a permitted flirtation</line>
      <line>Under those vulgar eyes, the observed of such observers!</line>
      <line>Well, but I now, by a series of fine diplomatic inquiries,</line>
      <line>Find from a sort of relation, a good and sensible woman,</line>
      <line>Who is remaining at Rome with a brother too ill for removal,</line>
      <line>That it was wholly unsanctioned, unknown,—not, I think, by Georgina:</line>
      <line>She, however, ere this,—and that is the best of the story,—</line>
      <line>She and the Vernon, thank Heaven, are wedded and gone — honey-mooning.</line>
      <line>So—on Montorio’s height for a last farewell of the city.</line>
      <line>Tibur I have not seen, nor the lakes that of old I had dreamt of;</line>
      <line>Tiber I shall not see, nor Anio’s waters, nor deep en-</line>

      <line>Tibur I shall not see;—but something better I shall see.</line>

      <line>Seen from Montorio’s height, Tibur and/Esula’s hills!</line>
      <line>Ah, could we once, ere we go, could we stand, while, to ocean descending,</line>

      <line>Stand, from the forest emerging at sunset, at once in the champaign,</line>

      <line>There was a letter left; but the cameriere had lost it.</line>
      <line>Could it have been for me? They came, however, to Como,</line>
      <line>And from Como went by the boat,—perhaps to the Spliigen,—</line>
      <line>Or to the Stelvio, say, and the Tyrol; also it might be</line>
      <line>By Porlezza across to Lugano, and so to the Simplon</line>
      <line>Possibly, or the St Gothard,—or possibly, too, to Baveno,</line>
      <line>Orta, Turin, and elsewhere. Indeed, I am greatly bewildered.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have been up the Spliigen, and on the Stelvio also:</line>
      <line>Neither of these can I find they have followed; in no one inn, and</line>
      <line>This would be odd, have they written their names. I have been to Porlezza;</line>
      <line>There they have not been seen, and therefore not at Lugano.</line>
      <line>What shall I do? Go on through the Tyrol, Switzerland, Deutschland,</line>
      <line>Seeking, an inverse Saul, a kingdom, to find only asses?</line>
      <line>There is a tide, at least in the love affairs of mortals,</line>
      <line>Which, when taken at flood, leads on to the happiest fortune,—</line>
      <line>Leads to the marriage-morn and the orange-flowers and the altar,</line>
      <line>And the long lawful line of crowned joys to crowned joys succeeding.—</line>
      <line>Ah, it has ebbed with me! Ye gods, and when it was flowing,</line>
      <line>Pitiful fool that I was, to stand fiddle-faddling in that way!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have returned and found their names in the book at Como.</line>
      <line>Certain it is I was right, and yet I am also in error.</line>
      <line>Added in feminine hand, I read, By the boat to Bellaggio.—</line>
      <line>So to Bellaggio again, with the words of her writing to aid me.</line>
      <line>Yet at Bellaggio I find no trace, no sort of remembrance.</line>
      <line>So I am here, and wait, and know every hour will remove them.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have but one chance left,—and that is going to Florence.</line>
      <line>But it is cruel to turn. The mountains seem to demand me,—</line>
      <line>Peak and valley from far to beckon and motion me onward.</line>
      <line>Somewhere amid their folds she passes whom fain I would follow;</line>
      <line>Somewhere among those heights she haply calls me to seek her.</line>
      <line>Ah, could I hear her call! could I catch the glimpse of her raiment!</line>
      <line>Turn, however, I must, though it seem I turn to desert her;</line>
      <line>For the sense of the thing is simply to hurry to Florence,</line>

      <line>Dear Miss Roper,—By this you are safely away, we are hoping,</line>
      <line>Many a league from Rome; erelong we trust we shall see you.</line>
      <line>Flow have you travelled? I wonder;—was Mr Claude your companion?</line>
      <line>As for ourselves, we went from Como straight to Lugano;</line>
      <line>So by the Mount St Gothard; we meant to go by Porlezza,</line>
      <line>Taking the steamer, and stopping, as you had advised, at Bellaggio,</line>
      <line>Two or three days or more; but this was suddenly altered,</line>
      <line>After we left the hotel, on the very way to the steamer.</line>
      <line>So we have seen, I fear, not one of the lakes in perfection.</line>
      <line>Well, he is not come; and now, I suppose, he will not come.</line>
      <line>What will you think, meantime?—and yet I must really confess it;—</line>
      <line>What will you say? I wrote him a note. We left in a hurry,</line>
      <line>Went from Milan to Como, three days before we expected.</line>
      <line>But I thought, if he came all the way to Milan, he really</line>
      <line>Ought not to be disappointed; and so I wrote three lines to</line>
      <line>Say I had heard he was coming, desirous of joining our party;—</line>
      <line>If so, then I said, we had started for Como, and meant to</line>
      <line>Cross the St Gothard, and stay, we believed, at Lucerne, for the summer.</line>
      <line>Was it wrong? and why, if it was, has it failed to bring him?</line>
      <line>Did he not think it worth while to come to Milan? He knew (you</line>
      <line>Told him) the house we should go to. Or may it, perhaps, have miscarried?</line>
      <line>Any way, now, I repent, and am heartily vexed that I wrote it.</line>

      <line>Parthenope do they call thee?—the Siren, Neapolis, seated</line>
      <line>Under Vesevus’s hill,—are we receding to thee?—</line>
      <line>Sicily, Greece, will invite, and the Orient;—or are we to turn to</line>
      <line>England, which may after all be for its children the best?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So you are really free, and living in quiet at Florence;</line>
      <line>That is delightful news;—you travelled slowly and safely;</line>
      <line>Mr Claude got you out; took rooms at Florence before you;</line>
      <line>Wrote from Milan to say so; had left directly for Milan,</line>
      <line>Hoping to find us soon;—if he could, he would, you are certain.—</line>
      <line>Dear Miss Roper, your letter has made me exceedingly happy.</line>
      <line>You are quite sure, you say, he asked you about our intentions;</line>
      <line>You had not heard as yet of Lucerne, but told him of Como.—</line>
      <line>Well, perhaps he will come;—however, I will not expect it.</line>
      <line>Though you say you are sure,—if he can, he will, you are certain.</line>
      <line>O my dear, many thanks from your ever affectionate Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>ACTION will furnish belief—but will that belief be the true one?</line>
      <line>This is the point, you know. However, it doesn’t much matter.</line>
      <line>What one wants, I suppose, is to predetermine the action,</line>
      <line>So as to make it entail, not a chance-belief, but the true one.</line>
      <line>Out of the question, you say; if a thing isn’t wrong, we may do it.</line>
      <line>Ah! but this wrong, you see—but I do not know that it matters.</line>
      <line>Eustace, the Ropers are gone, and no one can tell me about them.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Pisa, they say they think; and so I follow to Pisa,</line>
      <line>Hither and thither inquiring, I weary of making inquiries;</line>
      <line>I am ashamed, I declare, of asking people about it.—</line>
      <line>Who are your friends? You said you had friends who would certainly know them.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But it is idle, moping, and thinking, and trying to fix her</line>
      <line>Image more and more in, to write the old perfect inscription</line>
      <line>Over and over again upon every page of remembrance.</line>
      <line>I have settled to stay at Florence to wait for your answer.</line>
      <line>Who are your friends? Write quickly and tell me. I wait for your answer.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You are at Lucca Baths, you tell me, to stay for the summer;</line>
      <line>Florence was quite too hot; you can’t move further at present.</line>
      <line>Will you not come, do you think, before the summer is over?</line>
      <line>Mr C. got you out with very considerable trouble;</line>
      <line>And he was useful and kind, and seemed so happy to serve you;</line>
      <line>Didn’t stay with you long, but talked very openly to you;</line>
      <line>Made you almost his confessor, without appearing to know it,—</line>
      <line>What about?—and you say you didn’t need his confessions.</line>
      <line>O my dear Miss Roper, I dare not trust what you tell me!</line>
      <line>Will he come, do you think? I am really so sorry for him!</line>
      <line>They didn’t give him my letter at Milan, I feel pretty certain.</line>
      <line>You had told him Bellaggio. We didn’t go to Bellaggio;</line>
      <line>So he would miss our track, and perhaps never come to Lugano,</line>
      <line>Where we were written in full, To Lucerne across the St Gothard.</line>
      <line>But he could write to you;—you would tell him where you were going.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let me, then, bear to forget her. I will not cling to her falsely;</line>
      <line>Nothing factitious or forced shall impair the old happy relation.</line>
      <line>I will let myself go, forget, not try to remember;</line>
      <line>I will walk on my way, accept the chances that meet me,</line>
      <line>Freely encounter the world, imbibe these alien airs, and</line>
      <line>Never ask if new feelings and thoughts are of her or of others.</line>
      <line>Is she not changing, herself—the old image would only delude me.</line>
      <line>I will be bold, too, and change,—if it must be. Yet if in all things,</line>
      <line>Yet if I do but aspire evermore to the Absolute only,</line>
      <line>I shall be doing, I think, somehow, what she will be doing;—</line>
      <line>I shall be thine, O my child, some way, though I know not in what way.</line>
      <line>Let me submit to forget her; I must; I already forget her.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Utterly vain is, alas! this attempt at the Absolute,—wholly!</line>
      <line>I, who believed not in her, because I would fain believe nothing,</line>
      <line>Have to believe as I may, with a wilful, unmeaning acceptance.</line>
      <line>I, who refused to enfasten the roots of my floating existence</line>
      <line>In the rich earth, cling now to the hard, naked rock that is left me.—</line>
      <line>Ah! she was worthy, Eustace,—and that, indeed, is my comfort,—</line>
      <line>Worthy a nobler heart than a fool such as I could have given.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, it relieves me to write, though I do not send, and the chance that</line>
      <line>Takes may destroy my fragments. But as men pray, without asking</line>
      <line>Whether One really exist to hear or do anything for them,—</line>
      <line>Simply impelled by the need of the moment to turn to a Being</line>
      <line>In a conception of whom there is freedom from all limitation,—</line>
      <line>So in your image I turn to an ens rationis of friendship.</line>
      <line>Even so write in your name I know not to whom nor in what wise.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was a time, methought it was but lately departed,</line>
      <line>When, if a thing was denied me, I felt I was bound to attempt it;</line>
      <line>Choice alone should take, and choice alone should surrender.</line>
      <line>There was a time, indeed, when I had not retired thus early,</line>
      <line>Languidly thus, from pursuit of a purpose I once had adopted.</line>
      <line>But it is over, all that! I have slunk from the perilous field in</line>
      <line>Whose wild struggle of forces the prizes of life are contested.</line>
      <line>It is over, all that! I am a coward, and know it.</line>
      <line>Courage in me could be only factitious, unnatural, useless.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Comfort has come to me here in the dreary streets of the city,</line>
      <line>Comfort—how do you think?—with a barrel-organ to bring it.</line>
      <line>Moping along the streets, and cursing my day as I wandered,</line>
      <line>All of a sudden my ear met the sound of an English psalm-tune.</line>
      <line>Comfort me it did, till indeed I was very near crying.</line>
      <line>Ah, there is some great truth, partial, very likely, but needful,</line>
      <line>Lodged, I am strangely sure, in the tones of the English psalm-tune.</line>
      <line>Comfort it was at least; and I must take without question</line>
      <line>Comfort, however it come, in the dreary streets of the city.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What with trusting myself, and seeking support from within me,</line>
      <line>Almost I could believe I had gained a religious assurance,</line>
      <line>Formed in my own poor soul a great moral basis to rest on.</line>
      <line>Ah, but indeed I see, I feel it factitious entirely;</line>
      <line>I refuse, reject, and put it utterly from me;</line>
      <line>I will look straight out, see things, not try to evade them;</line>
      <line>Fact shall be fact for me; and the Truth the Truth as ever,</line>
      <line>Flexible, changeable, vague, and multiform, and doubtful.—</line>
      <line>Off, and depart to the void, thou subtle, fanatical tempter!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I shall behold thee again (is it so?) at a new visitation,</line>
      <line>O ill genius thou! I shall, at my life’s dissolution,</line>
      <line>(When the pulses are weak, and the feeble light of the reason</line>
      <line>Flickers, an unfed flame retiring slow from the socket),</line>
      <line>Low on a sick-bed laid, hear one, as it were, at the doorway,</line>
      <line>And, looking up, see thee, standing by, looking emptily at me;</line>
      <line>I shall entreat thee then, though now I dare to refuse thee,— no</line>
      <line>Pale and pitiful now, but terrible then to the dying.—</line>
      <line>Well, I will see thee again, and while I can, will repel thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Rome is fallen, I hear, the gallant Medici taken,</line>
      <line>Noble Manara slain, and Garibaldi has lost il Moro;—</line>
      <line>Rome is fallen; and fallen, or falling, heroical Venice.</line>
      <line>I, meanwhile, for the loss of a single small chit of a girl, sit</line>
      <line>Moping and mourning here,—for her, and myself much smaller.</line>
      <line>Whither depart the souls of the brave that die in the battle,</line>
      <line>Die in the lost, lost fight, for the cause that perishes with them?</line>
      <line>Are they upborne from the field on the slumberous pinions of angels</line>
      <line>Unto a far-off home, where the weary rest from their labour,</line>
      <line>And the deep wounds are healed, and the bitter and burning moisture</line>
      <line>Wiped from the generous eyes? or do they linger, unhappy,</line>
      <line>Pining, and haunting the grave of their by-gone hope and endeavour?</line>
      <line>All declamation, alas! though I talk, I care not for Rome, nor</line>
      <line>Italy; feebly and faintly, and but with the lips, can lament the</line>
      <line>Wreck of the Lombard youth and the victory of the oppressor.</line>
      <line>Whither depart the brave?—God knows; I certainly do not.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He has not come as yet; and now I must not expect it.</line>
      <line>You have written you say, to friends at Florence, to see him,</line>
      <line>If he perhaps should return;—but that is surely unlikely.</line>
      <line>Has he not written to you?—he did not know your direction.</line>
      <line>Oh, how strange never once to have told him where you were going!</line>
      <line>Yet if he only wrote to Florence, that would have reached you.</line>
      <line>If what ypu say he said was true, why has he not done so?</line>
      <line>Is he gone back to Rome, do you think, to his Vatican marbles?—</line>
      <line>O my dear Miss Roper, forgive me! do not be angry!—</line>
      <line>You have written to Florence;—your friends would certainly find him.</line>
      <line>Might you not write to him?—but yet it is so little likely!</line>
      <line>I shall expect nothing more.—Ever yours, your affectionate Mary.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I cannot stay at Florence, not even to wait for a letter.</line>
      <line>Galleries only oppress me. Remembrance of hope I had cherished</line>
      <line>(Almost more than as hope, when I passed through Florence the first time)</line>
      <line>Lies like a sword in my soul. I am more a coward than ever,</line>
      <line>Chicken-hearted, past thought. The caffes and waiters distress me.</line>
      <line>All is unkind, and, alas! I am ready for any one’s kindness.</line>
      <line>Oh, I knew it of old, and knew it, I thought, to perfection,</line>
      <line>If there is any one thing in the world to preclude all kindness,</line>
      <line>It is the need of it,—it is this sad, self-defeating dependence.</line>
      <line>Why is this, Eustace? Myself, were I stronger, I think I could tell you.</line>
      <line>But it is odd when it comes. So plumb I the deeps of depression,</line>
      <line>Daily in deeper, and find no support, no will, no purpose.</line>
      <line>All my old strengths are gone. And yet I shall have to do something.</line>
      <line>Ah, the key of our life, that passes all wards, opens all locks,</line>
      <line>Is not I will, but / must. I must,—I must,—and I do it.</line>
      <line>After all, do I know that I really cared so about her?</line>
      <line>Do whatever I will, I cannot call up her image;</line>
      <line>For when I close my eyes, I see, very likely, St Peter’s,</line>
      <line>Or the Pantheon faqade, or Michel Angelo’s figures,</line>
      <line>Or, at a wish, when I please, the Alban hills and the Forum,—</line>
      <line>But that face, those eyes,—ah no, never anything like them;</line>
      <line>Only, try as I will, a sort of featureless outline,</line>
      <line>And a pale blank orb, which no recollection will add to.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>After all perhaps there was something factitious about it:</line>
      <line>I have had pain, it is true; I have wept; and so have the actors.</line>
      <line>At the last moment I have your letter, for which I was waiting.</line>
      <line>I have taken my place, and see no good in inquiries.</line>
      <line>Do nothing more, good Eustace, I pray you. It only will vex me.</line>
      <line>Take no measures. Indeed, should we meet, I could not be certain;</line>
      <line>All might be changed, you know. Or perhaps there was nothing to be changed.</line>
      <line>It is a curious history, this; and yet I foresaw it;</line>
      <line>I could have told it before. The Fates, it is clear, are against us;</line>
      <line>For it is certain enough that I met with the people you mention;</line>
      <line>They were at Florence the day I returned there, and spoke to me even;</line>
      <line>Stayed a week, saw me often; departed, and whither I know not.</line>
      <line>Great is Fate, and is best. I believe in Providence partly.</line>
      <line>What is ordained is right, and all that happens is ordered.</line>
      <line>Ah, no, that isn’t it. But yet I retain my conclusion.</line>
      <line>I will go where I am led, and will not dictate to the chances.</line>
      <line>Do nothing more, I beg. If you love me, forbear interfering.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Shall we come out of it all, some day, as one does from a tunnel?</line>
      <line>Will it be all at once, without our doing or asking,</line>
      <line>We shall behold clear day, the trees and meadows about us,</line>
      <line>And the faces of friends, and the eyes we loved looking at us?</line>
      <line>Who knows? Who can say? It will not do to suppose it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Rome will not suit me, Eustace; the priests and soldiers possess it;</line>
      <line>Priests and soldiers;—and, ah! which is worst, the priest or the soldier?</line>
      <line>Politics, farewell, however! For what could I do? with inquiring,</line>
      <line>Talking, collating the journals, go fever my brain about things o’er</line>
      <line>Which I can have no control. No, happen whatever may happen,</line>
      <line>Time, I suppose, will subsist; the earth will revolve on its axis;</line>
      <line>People will travel; the stranger will wander as now in the city;</line>
      <line>Rome will be here, and the Pope the custode of Vatican marbles.</line>
      <line>I have no heart, however, for any marble or fresco;</line>
      <line>I have essayed it in vain; ’tis vain as yet to essay it:</line>
      <line>But I may haply resume some day my studies in this kind;</line>
      <line>Not as the Scripture says, is, I think, the fact. Ere our death-day,</line>
      <line>Faith, I think, does pass, and Fove; but Knowledge abideth.</line>
      <line>Let us seek Knowledge;—the rest must come and go as it happens.</line>
      <line>Knowledge is hard to seek, and harder yet to adhere to.</line>
      <line>Knowledge is painful often; and yet when we know, we are happy.</line>
      <line>Seek it, and leave mere Faith and Love to come with the chances.</line>
      <line>As for Hope,—to-morrow I hope to be starting for Naples.</line>
      <line>Rome will not do, I see, for many very good reasons.</line>
      <line>Eastward, then, I suppose, with the coming of winter, to Egypt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You have heard nothing; of course, I know you can have heard nothing.</line>
      <line>Ah, well, more than once I have broken my purpose, and sometimes,</line>
      <line>Only too often, have looked for the little lake-steamer to bring him.</line>
      <line>But it is only fancy,—I do not really expect it.</line>
      <line>Oh, and you see I know so exactly how he would take it:</line>
      <line>Finding the chances prevail against meeting again, he would banish</line>
      <line>Forthwith every thought of the poor little possible hope, which</line>
      <line>I myself could not help, perhaps, thinking only too much of;</line>
      <line>He would resign himself, and go. I see it exactly.</line>
      <line>So I also submit, although in a different manner.</line>
      <line>Can you not really come? We go very shortly to England.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So go forth to the world, to the good report and the evil?</line>
      <line>Go, little book! thy tale, is it not evil and good?</line>
      <line>Go, and if strangers revile, pass quietly by without answer.</line>
      <line>Go, and if curious friends ask of thy rearing and age,</line>
      <line>Say, 7 am flitting about many years from brain unto brain of</line>
      <line>Feeble and restless youths bom to inglorious days;</line>
      <line>But,’ so finish the word, 'I was writ in a Roman chamber,</line>
      <line>When from Janiculan heights thundered the cannon of France.’</line>

      <line>O dear! what a pity they ever should lose it!</line>
      <line>For they are the gentry that know how to use it;</line>
      <line>So grand and so graceful, such manners, such dinners,</line>
      <line>But yet, after all, it is we are the winners.</line>
      <line>So pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!</line>

      <line>Thus I sat at my table en grand seigneur,</line>

      <line>Not only the pleasure, one’s self, of good eating,</line>
      <line>But also the pleasure of now and then treating.</line>
      <line>So pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!</line>

      <line>They may talk as they please about what they call pelf,</line>

      <line>And how pleasures of thought surpass eating and drinking—</line>
      <line>My pleasure of thought is the pleasure of thinking</line>
      <line>How pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!</line>
      <line>How pleasant it is to have money.</line>

      <line>A gondola here, and a gondola there,</line>
      <line>’Tis the pleasantest fashion of taking the air.</line>
      <line>To right and to left; stop, turn, and go yonder,</line>
      <line>And let us repeat, o’er the tide as we wander,</line>
      <line>How pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!</line>
      <line>How pleasant it is to have money.</line>

    <title>I dreamed a dream: I dreamt that I espied,</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Upon a stone that was not rolled aside,</line>
      <line>A shadow sitting by a grave—a Shade,</line>
      <line>As thin, as unsubstantial, as of old</line>
      <line>Came, the Greek poet told,</line>
      <line>To lick the life-blood in the trench Ulysses made—</line>
      <line>As pale, as thin, and said:</line>
      <line>‘I am the resurrection of the dead.</line>
      <line>The night is past, the morning is at hand,</line>
      <line>And I must in my proper semblance stand,</line>
      <line>Appear brief space and vanish,—hear me, this is true,</line>
      <line>I am that Jesus whom they slew.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And shadows dim, I dreamed, the dead apostles came,</line>
      <line>And bent their heads for sorrow and for shame—</line>
      <line>Sorrow for their great loss, and shame</line>
      <line>For what they did in that vain name.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And in long ranges far behind there seemed</line>
      <line>Pale vapoury angel forms; or was it cloud? that kept</line>
      <line>Strange watch; the women also stood beside and wept.</line>
      <line>And Peter spoke the word:</line>
      <line>‘O my own Lord,</line>
      <line>What is it we must do?</line>
      <line>Is it then all untrue?</line>
      <line>Did we not see, and hear, and handle thee,</line>
      <line>Yea, for whole hours</line>
      <line>Upon the Mount in Galilee,</line>
      <line>On the lake shore, and here at Bethany,</line>
      <line>When thou ascended to thy God and ours?’</line>
      <line>And paler still became the distant cloud,</line>
      <line>The women wept aloud.</line>
      <line>And the Shade answered, ‘What ye say I know not;</line>
      <line>But it is true</line>
      <line>I am that Jesus whom they slew,</line>
      <line>Whom ye have preached, but in what way I know not.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the great World, it chanced, came by that way,</line>
      <line>And stopped, and looked, and spoke to the police,</line>
      <line>And said the thing, for order’s sake and peace,</line>
      <line>Most certainly must be suppressed, the nuisance cease.</line>
      <line>His wife and daughter must have where to pray,</line>
      <line>And whom to pray to, at the least one day</line>
      <line>In seven, and something definite to say.</line>
      <line>Whether the fact so many years ago</line>
      <line>Had, or not, happened, how was he to know?</line>
      <line>Yet he had always heard that it was so.</line>
      <line>As for himself, perhaps it was all one;</line>
      <line>And yet he found it not unpleasant, too,</line>
      <line>On Sunday morning in the roomy pew,</line>
      <line>To see the thing with such decorum done.</line>
      <line>As for himself, perhaps it was all one;</line>
      <line>Yet on one’s death-bed all men always said</line>
      <line>It was a comfortable thing to think upon</line>
      <line>The Atonement and the Resurrection of the dead.</line>
      <line>So the great world as having said his say,</line>
      <line>Unto his country-house pursued his way.</line>
      <line>And on the grave the Shadow sat all day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the poor Pope was sure it must be so,</line>
      <line>Else wherefore did the people kiss his toe?</line>
      <line>The subtle Jesuit cardinal shook his head,</line>
      <line>And mildly looked and said,</line>
      <line>It mattered not a jot</line>
      <line>Whether the thing, indeed, were so or not;</line>
      <line>Religion must be kept up, and the Church preserved,</line>
      <line>And for the people this best served,</line>
      <line>And then he turned, and added most demurely,</line>
      <line>‘Whatever may befall,</line>
      <line>We Catholics need no evidence at all,</line>
      <line>The holy father is infallible, surely!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>An English canon heard,</line>
      <line>And [quietly demurred.]</line>
      <line>Religion rests on evidence, of course,</line>
      <line>And on inquiry we must put no force.</line>
      <line>Difficulties still, upon whatever ground,</line>
      <line>Are likely, almost certain, to be found.</line>
      <line>The Theist scheme, the Pantheist, one and all,</line>
      <line>Must with, or e’en before, the Christian fall.</line>
      <line>And till the thing were plainer to our eyes,</line>
      <line>To disturb faith was surely most unwise.</line>
      <line>As for the Shade, who trusted such narrations?</line>
      <line>Except, of course, in ancient revelations.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And dignitaries of the Church came by.</line>
      <line>It had been worth to some of them, they said,</line>
      <line>Some £100,000 a year a head.</line>
      <line>If it fetched so much in the market, truly,</line>
      <line>’Twas not a thing to be given up unduly.</line>
      <line>It had been proved by Butler in one way,</line>
      <line>By Paley better in a later day;</line>
      <line>It had been proved in twenty ways at once,</line>
      <line>By many a doctor plain to any a dunce;</line>
      <line>There was no question but it must be so.</line>
      <line>And the Shade answered, that he did not know;</line>
      <line>He had no reading, and might be deceived,</line>
      <line>But still He was the Christ, as he believed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And women, mild and pure,</line>
      <line>Forth from still homes and village schools did pass,</line>
      <line>And asked, if this indeed were thus, alas,</line>
      <line>What should they teach their children and the poor?</line>
      <line>The Shade replied, he could not know,</line>
      <line>But it was truth, the fact was so.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Who had kept all commandments from his youth</line>
      <line>Yet still found one thing lacking—even Truth:</line>
      <line>And the Shade only answered, ‘Go, make haste,</line>
      <line>Enjoy thy great possessions as thou may’st.’</line>

      <line>It may be true too</line>
      <line>That while we walk the troublous tossing sea,</line>
      <line>That when we see the o’ertopping waves advance,</line>

      <line>There are who walk beside us; and the cry</line>
      <line>That rises so spontaneous to the lips,</line>
      <line>The ‘Help us or we perish,’ is not nought,</line>
      <line>An evanescent spectrum of disease.</line>
      <line>It may be that in deed and not in fancy,</line>
      <line>A hand that is not ours upstays our steps,</line>
      <line>A voice that is not ours commands the waves,</line>
      <line>Commands the waves, and whispers in our ear,</line>
      <line>O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</line>
      <line>At any rate—</line>
      <line>That there are beings above us, I suppose,</line>

      <line>And the stars in her hair were seven.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,</line>
      <line>No wrought flowers did adorn,</line>
      <line>But a white rose of Mary’s gift,</line>
      <line>For service meetly worn;</line>
      <line>Her hair that lay along her back</line>
      <line>Was yellow like ripe corn.</line>

      <line>One of God’s choristers;</line>

      <line>Of ether, as a bridge.</line>
      <line>Beneath, the tides of day and night</line>
      <line>With flame and darkness ridge</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>This sunlight shames November where he grieves</line>
      <line>In dead red leaves, and will not let him shun</line>
      <line>The day, though bough with bough be over-run.</line>
      <line>But with a blessing every glade receives</line>
      <line>High salutation; while from hillock-eaves</line>
      <line>The deer gaze calling, dappled white and dun,</line>
      <line>As if, being foresters of old, the sun</line>
      <line>Had marked them with the shade of forest-leaves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here dawn to-day unveiled her magic glass;</line>
      <line>Here noon now gives the thirst and takes the dew;</line>
      <line>Till eve bring rest when other good things pass.</line>
      <line>And here the lost hours the lost hours renew</line>
      <line>While I still lead my shadow o’er the grass,</line>
      <line>Nor know, for longing, that which I should do.</line>

      <line>I walked for bed: and so, to get some ease,</line>
      <line>I dogged the flying moon with similes.</line>
      <line>And like a wisp she doubled on my sight</line>
      <line>In ponds; and caught in tree-tops like a kite;</line>
      <line>And in a globe of film all liquorish</line>
      <line>Swam full-faced like a silly silver fish;—</line>
      <line>Last like a bubble shot the welkin’s height</line>
      <line>Where my road turned, and got behind me, and sent</line>
      <line>My wizened shadow craning round at me,</line>
      <line>And jeered, ‘So, step the measure,—one two three!’</line>
      <line>And if I faced on her, looked innocent.</line>
      <line>But just at parting, halfway down a dell,</line>
      <line>She kissed me for good-night. So you’ll not tell.</line>

      <line>All earth’s full rivers cannot fill</line>
      <line>The sea, that drinking thirsteth still.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sheer miracles of loveliness</line>
      <line>Lie hid in its unlooked-on bed:</line>
      <line>Anemones, salt, passionless,</line>
      <line>Blow flower-like; just enough alive</line>
      <line>To blow and multiply and thrive.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Shells quaint with curve, or spot, or spike,</line>
      <line>Encrusted live things argus-eyed,</line>
      <line>All fair alike, yet all unlike,</line>
      <line>Are born without a pang, and die</line>
      <line>Without a pang, and so pass by.</line>

    <title>Goblin Market</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Morning and evening</line>
      <line>Maids heard the goblins cry:</line>
      <line>‘Come buy our orchard fruits,</line>
      <line>Come buy, come buy:</line>
      <line>Apples and quinces,</line>
      <line>Lemons and oranges,</line>
      <line>Plump unpecked cherries,</line>
      <line>Melons and raspberries,</line>
      <line>Bloom-down-cheeked peaches,</line>
      <line>Swart-headed mulberries,</line>
      <line>Wild free-born cranberries,</line>
      <line>Crab-apples, dewberries,</line>
      <line>Pine-apples, blackberries,</line>
      <line>Apricots, strawberries;—</line>
      <line>All ripe together</line>
      <line>In summer weather,—</line>
      <line>Morns that pass by,</line>
      <line>Fair eves that fly;</line>
      <line>Come buy, come buy:</line>
      <line>Our grapes fresh from the vine,</line>
      <line>Pomegranates full and fine,</line>
      <line>Dates and sharp bullaces,</line>
      <line>Rare pears and greengages,</line>
      <line>Damsons and bilberries,</line>
      <line>Taste them and try:</line>
      <line>Currants and gooseberries,</line>
      <line>Bright-fire-like barberries,</line>
      <line>Figs to fill your mouth,</line>
      <line>Citrons from the South,</line>
      <line>Sweet to tongue and sound to eye;</line>
      <line>Come buy, come buy.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Evening by evening</line>
      <line>Among the brookside rushes,</line>
      <line>Laura bowed her head to hear,</line>
      <line>Lizzie veiled her blushes:</line>
      <line>Crouching close together</line>
      <line>In the cooling weather,</line>
      <line>With clasping arms and cautioning lips,</line>
      <line>With tingling cheeks and finger tips.</line>
      <line>‘Lie close,’ Laura said,</line>
      <line>Pricking up her golden head:</line>
      <line>‘We must not look at goblin men,</line>
      <line>We must not buy their fruits:</line>
      <line>Who knows upon what soil they fed</line>
      <line>Their hungry thirsty roots?’</line>
      <line>‘Come buy,’ call the goblins</line>
      <line>Hobbling down the glen.</line>
      <line>‘Oh,’ cried Lizzie, ‘Laura, Laura,</line>
      <line>You should not peep at goblin men.’</line>
      <line>Lizzie covered up her eyes,</line>
      <line>Covered close lest they should look;</line>
      <line>Laura reared her glossy head,</line>
      <line>And whispered like the restless brook:</line>
      <line>‘Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,</line>
      <line>Down the glen tramp little men.</line>
      <line>One hauls a basket,</line>
      <line>One bears a plate,</line>
      <line>One lugs a golden dish</line>
      <line>Of many pounds weight.</line>
      <line>How fair the vine must grow</line>
      <line>Whose grapes are so luscious;</line>
      <line>How warm the wind must blow</line>
      <line>Thro’ those fruit bushes.’</line>
      <line>‘No,’ said Lizzie: ‘No, no, no;</line>
      <line>Their offers should not charm us,</line>
      <line>Their evil gifts would harm us.’</line>
      <line>She thrust a dimpled finger</line>
      <line>In each ear, shut eyes and ran:</line>
      <line>Curious Laura chose to linger</line>
      <line>Wondering at each merchant man.</line>
      <line>One had a cat’s face,</line>
      <line>One whisked a tail,</line>
      <line>One tramped at a rat’s pace,</line>
      <line>One crawled like a snail,</line>
      <line>One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,</line>
      <line>One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.</line>
      <line>She heard a voice like voice of doves</line>
      <line>Cooing all together:</line>
      <line>They sounded kind and full of loves</line>
      <line>In the pleasant weather.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Laura stretched her gleaming neck</line>
      <line>Like a rush-imbedded swan,</line>
      <line>Like a lily from the beck,</line>
      <line>Like a moonlit poplar branch,</line>
      <line>Like a vessel at the launch</line>
      <line>When its last restraint is gone.</line>
      <line>Backwards up the mossy glen</line>
      <line>Turned and trooped the goblin men,</line>
      <line>With their shrill repeated cry,</line>
      <line>‘Come buy, come buy.’</line>
      <line>When they reached where Laura was</line>
      <line>They stood stock still upon the moss,</line>
      <line>Leering at each other,</line>
      <line>Brother with queer brother;</line>
      <line>Signalling each other,</line>
      <line>Brother with sly brother.</line>
      <line>One set his basket down,</line>
      <line>One reared his plate;</line>
      <line>One began to weave a crown</line>
      <line>Of tendrils, leaves and rough nuts brown</line>
      <line>(Men sell not such in any town);</line>
      <line>One heaved the golden weight</line>
      <line>Of dish and fruit to offer her:</line>
      <line>‘Come buy, come buy,’ was still their cry.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Laura stared but did not stir,</line>
      <line>Longed but had no money:</line>
      <line>The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste</line>
      <line>In tones as smooth as honey,</line>
      <line>The cat-faced purr’d,</line>
      <line>The rat-paced spoke a word</line>
      <line>Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;</line>
      <line>One parrot-voiced and jolly</line>
      <line>Cried ‘Pretty Goblin’ still for ‘Pretty Polly;’—</line>
      <line>One whistled like a bird.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:</line>
      <line>‘Good folk, I have no coin;</line>
      <line>To take were to purloin:</line>
      <line>I have no copper in my purse,</line>
      <line>1 have no silver either,</line>
      <line>And all my gold is on the furze</line>
      <line>That shakes in windy weather</line>
      <line>Above the rusty heather.’</line>
      <line>‘You have much gold upon your head,’</line>
      <line>They answered all together:</line>
      <line>‘Buy from us with a golden curl.’</line>
      <line>She clipped a precious golden lock,</line>
      <line>She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,</line>
      <line>Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red</line>
      <line>Sweeter than honey from the rock,</line>
      <line>Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,</line>
      <line>Clearer than water flowed that juice;</line>
      <line>She never tasted such before,</line>
      <line>How should it cloy with length of use?</line>
      <line>She sucked and sucked and sucked the more</line>
      <line>Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;</line>
      <line>She sucked until her lips were sore;</line>
      <line>Then flung the emptied rinds away</line>
      <line>But gathered up one kernel-stone,</line>
      <line>And knew not was it night or day</line>
      <line>As she turned home alone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Lizzie met her at the gate</line>
      <line>Full of wise upbraidings:</line>
      <line>‘Dear, you should not stay so late,</line>
      <line>Twilight is not good for maidens;</line>
      <line>Should not loiter in the glen</line>
      <line>In the haunts of goblin men.</line>
      <line>Do you not remember Jeanie,</line>
      <line>How she met them in the moonlight,</line>
      <line>Took their gifts both choice and many,</line>
      <line>Ate their fruits and wore their flowers</line>
      <line>Plucked from bowers</line>
      <line>Where summer ripens at all hours?</line>
      <line>But ever in the noonlight</line>
      <line>She pined and pined away;</line>
      <line>Sought them by night and day,</line>
      <line>Found them no more but dwindled and grew grey;</line>
      <line>Then fell with the first snow,</line>
      <line>While to this day no grass will grow</line>
      <line>Where she lies low:</line>
      <line>I planted daisies there a year ago</line>
      <line>That never blow.</line>
      <line>You should not loiter so.’</line>
      <line>‘Nay, hush,’ said Laura:</line>
      <line>‘Nay, hush, my sister:</line>
      <line>I ate and ate my fill,</line>
      <line>Yet my mouth waters still;</line>
      <line>Tomorrow night I will</line>
      <line>Buy more:’ and kissed her:</line>
      <line>‘Have done with sorrow;</line>
      <line>I’ll bring you plums tomorrow</line>
      <line>Fresh on their mother twigs,</line>
      <line>Cherries worth getting;</line>
      <line>You cannot think what figs</line>
      <line>My teeth have met in,</line>
      <line>What melons icy-cold</line>
      <line>Piled on a dish of gold</line>
      <line>Too huge for me to hold,</line>
      <line>What peaches with a velvet nap,</line>
      <line>Pellucid grapes without one seed:</line>
      <line>Odorous indeed must be the mead</line>
      <line>Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink</line>
      <line>With lilies at the brink,</line>
      <line>And sugar-sweet their sap.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Golden head by golden head,</line>
      <line>Like two pigeons in one nest</line>
      <line>Folded in each other’s wings,</line>
      <line>They lay down in their curtained bed:</line>
      <line>Like two blossoms on one stem,</line>
      <line>Like two flakes of new-fall’n snow,</line>
      <line>Like two wands of ivory</line>
      <line>Tipped with gold for awful kings.</line>
      <line>Moon and stars gazed in at them,</line>
      <line>Wind sang to them lullaby,</line>
      <line>Lumbering owls forbore to fly,</line>
      <line>Not a bat flapped to and fro</line>
      <line>Round their rest:</line>
      <line>Cheek to cheek and breast to breast</line>
      <line>Locked together in one nest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Early in the morning</line>
      <line>When the first cock crowed his warning,</line>
      <line>Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,</line>
      <line>Laura rose with Lizzie:</line>
      <line>Fetched in honey, milked the cows,</line>
      <line>Aired and set to rights the house,</line>
      <line>Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,</line>
      <line>Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,</line>
      <line>Next churned butter, whipped up cream,</line>
      <line>Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;</line>
      <line>Talked as modest maidens should:</line>
      <line>Lizzie with an open heart,</line>
      <line>Laura in an absent dream,</line>
      <line>One content, one sick in part;</line>
      <line>One warbling for the mere bright day’s delight,</line>
      <line>One longing for the night.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At length slow evening came:</line>
      <line>They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;</line>
      <line>Lizzie most placid in her look,</line>
      <line>Laura most like a leaping flame.</line>
      <line>They drew the gurgling water from its deep;</line>
      <line>Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,</line>
      <line>Then turning homewards said: ‘The sunset flushes</line>
      <line>Those furthest loftiest crags;</line>
      <line>Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,</line>
      <line>No wilful squirrel wags,</line>
      <line>The beasts and birds are fast asleep.’</line>
      <line>But Laura loitered still among the rushes</line>
      <line>And said the bank was steep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And said the hour was early still,</line>
      <line>The dew not fall’n, the wind not chill:</line>
      <line>Listening ever, but not catching</line>
      <line>The customary cry,</line>
      <line>‘Come buy, come buy,’</line>
      <line>With its iterated jingle</line>
      <line>Of sugar-baited words:</line>
      <line>Not for all her watching</line>
      <line>Once discerning even one goblin</line>
      <line>Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;</line>
      <line>Let alone the herds</line>
      <line>That used to tramp along the glen,</line>
      <line>In groups or single,</line>
      <line>Of brisk fruit-merchant men.</line>
      <line>Till Lizzie urged, ‘O Laura, come;</line>
      <line>I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:</line>
      <line>You should not loiter longer at this brook:</line>
      <line>Come with me home.</line>
      <line>The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,</line>
      <line>Each glowworm winks her spark,</line>
      <line>Let us get home before the night grows dark</line>
      <line>For clouds may gather</line>
      <line>Tho’ this is summer weather,</line>
      <line>Put out the lights and drench us thro’;</line>
      <line>Then if we lost our way what should we do?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Laura turned cold as stone</line>
      <line>To find her sister heard that cry alone,</line>
      <line>That goblin cry,</line>
      <line>‘Come buy our fruits, come buy.’</line>
      <line>Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?</line>
      <line>Must she no more such succous pasture find,</line>
      <line>Gone deaf and blind?</line>
      <line>Her tree of life drooped from the root:</line>
      <line>She said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;</line>
      <line>But peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning,</line>
      <line>Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;</line>
      <line>So crept to bed, and lay</line>
      <line>Silent till Lizzie slept;</line>
      <line>Then sat up in a passionate yearning,</line>
      <line>And gnashed her teeth for baulked desire, and wept</line>
      <line>As if her heart would break.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Day after day, night after night,</line>
      <line>Laura kept watch in vain</line>
      <line>In sullen silence of exceeding pain.</line>
      <line>She never caught again the goblin cry:</line>
      <line>‘Come buy, come buy;’—</line>
      <line>She never spied the goblin men</line>
      <line>Hawking their fruits along the glen:</line>
      <line>But when the noon waxed bright</line>
      <line>Her hair grew thin and gray;</line>
      <line>She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn</line>
      <line>To swift decay and burn</line>
      <line>Her fire away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One day remembering her kernel-stone</line>
      <line>She set it by a wall that faced the south;</line>
      <line>Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,</line>
      <line>Watched for a waxing shoot,</line>
      <line>But there came none;</line>
      <line>It never saw the sun,</line>
      <line>It never felt the trickling moisture run:</line>
      <line>While with sunk eyes and faded mouth</line>
      <line>She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees</line>
      <line>False waves in desert drouth</line>
      <line>With shade of leaf-crowned trees,</line>
      <line>And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She no more swept the house,</line>
      <line>Tended the fowls or cows,</line>
      <line>Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,</line>
      <line>Brought water from the brook:</line>
      <line>But sat down listless in the chimney-nook</line>
      <line>And would not eat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Tender Lizzie could not bear</line>
      <line>To watch her sister’s cankerous care</line>
      <line>Yet not to share.</line>
      <line>She night and morning</line>
      <line>Caught the goblins’ cry:</line>
      <line>‘Come buy our orchard fruits,</line>
      <line>Come buy, come buy:’—</line>
      <line>Beside the brook, along the glen,</line>
      <line>She heard the tramp of goblin men,</line>
      <line>The voice and stir</line>
      <line>Poor Laura could not hear;</line>
      <line>Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,</line>
      <line>But feared to pay too dear.</line>
      <line>She thought of Jeanie in her grave,</line>
      <line>Who should have been a bride;</line>
      <line>But who for joys brides hope to have</line>
      <line>Fell sick and died</line>
      <line>In her gay prime,</line>
      <line>In earliest Winter time,</line>
      <line>With the first glazing rime,</line>
      <line>With the first snow-fall of crisp Winter time.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till Laura dwindling</line>
      <line>Seemed knocking at Death’s door:</line>
      <line>Then Lizzie weighed no more</line>
      <line>Better and worse;</line>
      <line>But put a silver penny in her purse,</line>
      <line>Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze</line>
      <line>At twilight, halted by the brook:</line>
      <line>And for the first time in her life</line>
      <line>Began to listen and look.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Laughed every goblin</line>
      <line>When they spied her peeping:</line>
      <line>Came towards her hobbling,</line>
      <line>Flying, running, leaping,</line>
      <line>Puffing and blowing,</line>
      <line>Chuckling, clapping, crowing,</line>
      <line>Clucking and gobbling,</line>
      <line>Mopping and mowing,</line>
      <line>Full of airs and graces,</line>
      <line>Pulling wry faces,</line>
      <line>Demure grimaces,</line>
      <line>Cat-like and rat-like,</line>
      <line>Ratel- and wombat-like,</line>
      <line>Snail-paced in a hurry,</line>
      <line>Parrot-voiced and whistler,</line>
      <line>Helter skelter, hurry skurry,</line>
      <line>Chattering like magpies,</line>
      <line>Fluttering like pigeons,</line>
      <line>Gliding like fishes,—</line>
      <line>Plugged her and kissed her,</line>
      <line>Squeezed and caressed her:</line>
      <line>Stretched up their dishes,</line>
      <line>Panniers, and plates:</line>
      <line>‘Look at our apples</line>
      <line>Russet and dun,</line>
      <line>Bob at our cherries,</line>
      <line>Bite at our peaches,</line>
      <line>Citrons and dates,</line>
      <line>Grapes for the asking,</line>
      <line>Pears red with basking</line>
      <line>Out in the sun,</line>
      <line>Plums on their twigs;</line>
      <line>Pluck them and suck them,</line>
      <line>Pomegranates, figs.’—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Good folk,’ said Lizzie,</line>
      <line>Mindful of Jeanie:</line>
      <line>‘Give me much and many:’—</line>

      <line>Tossed them her penny.</line>
      <line>‘Nay, take a seat with us,</line>
      <line>Honour and eat with us,’</line>
      <line>They answered grinning:</line>

      <line>Night yet is early,</line>
      <line>Warm and dew-pearly,</line>
      <line>Wakeful and starry:</line>
      <line>Such fruits as these</line>
      <line>No man can carry;</line>
      <line>Half their bloom would fly,</line>
      <line>Half their dew would dry,</line>
      <line>Half their flavour would pass by.</line>
      <line>Sit down and feast with us,</line>
      <line>Be welcome guest with us,</line>
      <line>Cheer you and rest with us.’—</line>
      <line>‘Thank you,’ said Lizzie: ‘But one waits</line>
      <line>At home alone for me:</line>
      <line>So without further parleying,</line>
      <line>If you will not sell me any</line>
      <line>Of your fruits tho’ much and many,</line>
      <line>Give me back my silver penny</line>
      <line>I tossed you for a fee.’—</line>
      <line>They began to scratch their pates,</line>
      <line>No longer wagging, purring,</line>
      <line>But visibly demurring,</line>
      <line>Grunting and snarling.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One called her proud,</line>
      <line>Cross-grained, uncivil;</line>
      <line>Their tones waxed loud,</line>
      <line>Their looks were evil.</line>
      <line>Lashing their tails</line>
      <line>They trod and hustled her,</line>
      <line>Elbowed and jostled her,</line>
      <line>Clawed with their nails,</line>
      <line>Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,</line>
      <line>Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,</line>
      <line>Twitched her hair out by the roots,</line>
      <line>Stamped upon her tender feet,</line>

      <line>White and golden Lizzie stood,</line>

      <line>Lashed by tides obstreperously,—</line>

      <line>In a hoary roaring sea,</line>
      <line>Sending up a golden fire,—</line>

      <line>White with blossoms honey-sweet</line>
      <line>Sore beset by wasp and bee,—</line>

      <line>Of juice that syrupped all her face,</line>
      <line>And lodged in dimples of her chin,</line>
      <line>And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.</line>
      <line>At last the evil people</line>
      <line>Worn out by her resistance</line>
      <line>Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit</line>
      <line>Along whichever road they took,</line>
      <line>Not leaving root or stone or shoot;</line>
      <line>Some writhed into the ground,</line>

      <line>Sprang up the bank, tore thro’ the furze,</line>

      <line>Bouncing in her purse,</line>
      <line>Its bounce was music to her ear.</line>
      <line>She ran and ran</line>
      <line>As if she feared some goblin man</line>

      <line>Or something worse:</line>

      <line>The kind heart made her windy-paced</line>

      <line>She cried ‘Laura,’ up the garden,</line>

      <line>Never mind my bruises,</line>
      <line>Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices</line>
      <line>Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,</line>

      <line>Eat me, drink me, love me;</line>
      <line>Laura, make much of me:</line>

      <line>Laura started from her chair,</line>
      <line>Flung her arms up in the air,</line>
      <line>Clutched her hair:</line>
      <line>‘Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted</line>
      <line>For my sake the fruit forbidden?</line>
      <line>Must your light like mine be hidden,</line>
      <line>Your young life like mine be wasted,</line>
      <line>Undone in mine undoing</line>
      <line>And ruined in my ruin,</line>
      <line>Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?’—</line>
      <line>She clung about her sister,</line>
      <line>Kissed and kissed and kissed her:</line>
      <line>Tears once again</line>
      <line>Refreshed her shrunken eyes,</line>
      <line>Dropping like rain</line>
      <line>After long sultry drouth;</line>
      <line>Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,</line>
      <line>She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her lips began to scorch,</line>

      <line>Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,</line>
      <line>Rent all her robe, and wrung</line>
      <line>Her hands in lamentable haste,</line>
      <line>And beat her breast.</line>
      <line>Her locks streamed like the torch</line>
      <line>Borne by a racer at full speed,</line>
      <line>Or like the mane of horses in their flight,</line>
      <line>Or like an eagle when she stems the light</line>
      <line>Straight toward the sun,</line>
      <line>Or like a caged thing freed,</line>
      <line>Or like a flying flag when armies run.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Swift fire spread thro’ her veins, knocked at her heart,</line>
      <line>Met the fire smouldering there</line>
      <line>And overbore its lesser flame;</line>
      <line>She gorged on bitterness without a name:</line>
      <line>Ah! fool, to choose such part</line>
      <line>Of soul-consuming care!</line>
      <line>Sense failed in the mortal strife:</line>
      <line>Like the watch-tower of a town</line>
      <line>Which an earthquake shatters down,</line>
      <line>Like a lightning-stricken mast,</line>
      <line>Like a wind-uprooted tree</line>
      <line>Spun about,</line>
      <line>Like a foam-topped waterspout</line>
      <line>Cast down headlong in the sea,</line>
      <line>She fell at last;</line>
      <line>Pleasure past and anguish past,</line>

      <line>Life out of death.</line>
      <line>That night long Lizzie watched by her,</line>
      <line>Counted her pulse’s flagging stir,</line>
      <line>Felt for her breath,</line>
      <line>Held water to her lips, and cooled her face</line>
      <line>With tears and fanning leaves:</line>
      <line>But when the first birds chirped about their eaves,</line>
      <line>And early reapers plodded to the place</line>
      <line>Of golden sheaves,</line>
      <line>And dew-wet grass</line>
      <line>Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass,</line>
      <line>And new buds with new day</line>
      <line>Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream,</line>
      <line>Laura awoke as from a dream,</line>
      <line>Laughed in the innocent old way,</line>
      <line>Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice;</line>
      <line>Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of grey,</line>
      <line>Her breath was sweet as May</line>
      <line>And light danced in her eyes.</line>

      <line>Days, weeks, months, years</line>
      <line>Afterwards, when both were wives</line>
      <line>With children of their own;</line>
      <line>Their mother-hearts beset with fears,</line>
      <line>Their lives bound up in tender lives;</line>
      <line>Laura would call the little ones</line>
      <line>And tell them of her early prime,</line>
      <line>Those pleasant days long gone</line>
      <line>Of not-returning time:</line>
      <line>Would talk about the haunted glen,</line>
      <line>The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,</line>
      <line>Their fruits like honey to the throat</line>
      <line>But poison in the blood;</line>
      <line>(Men sell not such in any town:)</line>
      <line>Would tell them how her sister stood</line>
      <line>In deadly peril to do her good,</line>
      <line>And win the fiery antidote:</line>
      <line>Then joining hands to little hands</line>
      <line>Would bid them cling together,</line>
      <line>‘For there is no friend like a sister</line>
      <line>In calm or stormy weather;</line>
      <line>To cheer one on the tedious way,</line>
      <line>To fetch one if one goes astray,</line>
      <line>To lift one if one totters down,</line>
      <line>To strengthen whilst one stands.’</line>

      <line>Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill;</line>
      <line>Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes!</line>
      <line>No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,</line>
      <line>Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,</line>
      <line>Nor the cropp’d herbage shoot another head.</line>
      <line>But when the fields are still,</line>
      <line>And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,</line>
      <line>And only the white sheep are sometimes seen</line>
      <line>Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch’d green,</line>
      <line>Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here, where the reaper was at work of late—</line>
      <line>In this high field’s dark corner, where he leaves</line>
      <line>His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,</line>
      <line>And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,</line>
      <line>Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use—</line>
      <line>Here will I sit and wait,</line>
      <line>While to my ear from uplands far away</line>
      <line>The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,</line>
      <line>With distant cries of reapers in the corn—</line>
      <line>All the live murmur of a summer’s day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Screen’d is this nook o’er the high, half-reap’d field,</line>
      <line>And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be.</line>
      <line>Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,</line>
      <line>And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see</line>
      <line>Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;</line>
      <line>And air-swept lindens yield</line>
      <line>Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers</line>
      <line>Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,</line>
      <line>And bower me from the August sun with shade;</line>
      <line>And the eye travels down to Oxford’s towers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And near me on the grass lies Glanvil’s book—</line>
      <line>Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!</line>
      <line>The story of the Oxford scholar poor,</line>
      <line>Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,</line>
      <line>Who, tired of knocking at preferment’s door,</line>
      <line>One summer-morn forsook</line>
      <line>His friends, and went to learn the gipsy-lore,</line>
      <line>And roam’d the world with that wild brotherhood,</line>
      <line>And came, as most men deem’d, to little good,</line>
      <line>But came to Oxford and his friends no more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But once, years after, in the country-lanes,</line>
      <line>Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,</line>
      <line>Met him, and of his way of life enquired;</line>
      <line>Whereat he answer’d, that the gipsy-crew,</line>
      <line>His mates, had arts to rule as they desired</line>
      <line>The workings of men’s brains,</line>
      <line>And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.</line>
      <line>‘And I,’ he said, ‘the secret of their art,</line>
      <line>When fully learn’d, will to the world impart;</line>
      <line>But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This said, he left them, and return’d no more.—</line>
      <line>But rumours hung about the country-side,</line>
      <line>That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,</line>
      <line>Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,</line>
      <line>In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,</line>
      <line>The same the gipsies wore.</line>
      <line>Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;</line>
      <line>At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,</line>
      <line>On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock’d boors</line>
      <line>Had found him seated at their entering,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, ’mid their drink and clatter, he would fly.</line>
      <line>And I myself seem half to know thy looks,</line>
      <line>And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;</line>
      <line>And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks</line>
      <line>I ask if thou hast pass’d their quiet place;</line>
      <line>Or in my boat I lie</line>
      <line>Moor’d to the cool bank in the summer-heats,</line>
      <line>’Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,</line>
      <line>And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills,</line>
      <line>And wonder if thou haunt’st their shy retreats.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For most, I know, thou lov’st retired ground!</line>
      <line>Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,</line>
      <line>Returning home on summer-nights, have met</line>
      <line>Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,</line>
      <line>Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,</line>
      <line>As the punt’s rope chops round;</line>
      <line>And leaning backward in a pensive dream,</line>
      <line>And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers</line>
      <line>Pluck’d in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,</line>
      <line>And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then they land, and thou art seen no more!—</line>
      <line>Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come</line>
      <line>To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,</line>
      <line>Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,</line>
      <line>Or cross a stile into the public way.</line>
      <line>Oft thou hast given them store</line>
      <line>Of flowers—the frail-leaf d, white anemony,</line>
      <line>Dark bluebells drench’d with dews of summer eves,</line>
      <line>And purple orchises with spotted leaves—</line>
      <line>But none hath words she can report of thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time’s here</line>
      <line>In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,</line>
      <line>Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass</line>
      <line>Where black-wing’d swallows haunt the glittering Thames,</line>
      <line>To bathe in the abandon’d lasher pass,</line>
      <line>Have often pass’d thee near</line>
      <line>Sitting upon the river bank o’ergrown;</line>
      <line>Mark’d thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,</line>
      <line>Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air—</line>
      <line>But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,</line>
      <line>Where at her open door the housewife darns,</line>
      <line>Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate</line>
      <line>To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.</line>
      <line>Children, who early range these slopes and late</line>
      <line>For cresses from the rills,</line>
      <line>Have known thee eying, all an April-day,</line>
      <line>The springing pastures and the feeding kine;</line>
      <line>And mark’d thee, when the stars come out and shine,</line>
      <line>Through the long dewy grass move slow away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood—</line>
      <line>Where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way</line>
      <line>Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see</line>
      <line>With scarlet patches tagg’d and shreds of grey,</line>
      <line>Above the forest-ground called Thessaly—</line>
      <line>The blackbird, picking food,</line>
      <line>Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;</line>
      <line>So often has he known thee past him stray,</line>
      <line>Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither’d spray,</line>
      <line>And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And once, in winter, on the causeway chill</line>
      <line>Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,</line>
      <line>Have I not pass’d thee on the wooden bridge,</line>
      <line>Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,</line>
      <line>Thy face tow’rd Hinksey and its wintry ridge?</line>
      <line>And thou hast climb’d the hill,</line>
      <line>And gain’d the white brow of the Cumner range;</line>
      <line>Turn’d once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,</line>
      <line>The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall—</line>
      <line>Then sought thy straw in some sequester’d grange.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But what—I dream! Two hundred years are flown</line>
      <line>Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,</line>

      <line>That thou wert wander’d from the studious walls</line>
      <line>To learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe;</line>
      <line>And thou from earth art gone</line>
      <line>Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid—</line>
      <line>Some country-nook, where o’er thy unknown grave</line>
      <line>Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave,</line>
      <line>Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree’s shade.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>—No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!</line>
      <line>For what wears out the life of mortal men?</line>

      <line>’Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,</line>
      <line>Exhaust the energy of strongest souls</line>
      <line>And numb the elastic powers.</line>
      <line>Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,</line>

      <line>Our worn-out life, and are—what we have been.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thou hast not lived, why should’st thou perish, so?</line>

      <line>Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!</line>
      <line>The generations of thy peers are fled,</line>
      <line>And we ourselves shall go;</line>

      <line>Because thou hadst—what we, alas! have not.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For early didst thou leave the world, with powers</line>
      <line>Fresh, undiverted to the world without,</line>
      <line>Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;</line>
      <line>Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,</line>

      <line>But none has hope like thine!</line>
      <line>Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,</line>
      <line>Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,</line>
      <line>Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,</line>
      <line>And every doubt long blown by time away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,</line>
      <line>And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;</line>
      <line>Before this strange disease of modern life,</line>
      <line>With its sick hurry, its divided aims,</line>
      <line>Its heads o’ertax’d, its palsied hearts, was rife—</line>
      <line>Fly hence, our contact fear!</line>
      <line>Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!</line>
      <line>Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern</line>
      <line>From her false friend’s approach in Hades turn,</line>
      <line>Wave us away, and keep thy solitude!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Still nursing the unconquerable hope,</line>
      <line>Still clutching the inviolable shade,</line>
      <line>With a free, onward impulse brushing through,</line>
      <line>By night, the silver’d branches of the glade—</line>
      <line>Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,</line>
      <line>On some mild pastoral slope</line>
      <line>Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales</line>
      <line>Freshen thy flowers as in former years</line>
      <line>With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,</line>
      <line>From the dark dingles, to the nightingales!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!</line>
      <line>For strong the infection of our mental strife,</line>
      <line>Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;</line>
      <line>And we should win thee from thy own fair life,</line>
      <line>Like us distracted, and like us unblest.</line>
      <line>Soon, soon thy cheer would die,</line>
      <line>Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix’d thy powers,</line>
      <line>And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;</line>
      <line>And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,</line>
      <line>Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!</line>
      <line>—As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,</line>
      <line>Descried at sunrise an emerging prow</line>
      <line>Lifting the cool-hair’d creepers stealthily,</line>
      <line>The fringes of a southward-facing brow</line>
      <line>Among the Ægean isles;</line>
      <line>And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,</line>
      <line>Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,</line>
      <line>Green, bursting figs, and tunnies steep’d in brine—</line>
      <line>And knew the intruders on his ancient home,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The young light-hearted masters of the waves—</line>
      <line>And snatch’d his rudder, and shook out more sail;</line>
      <line>And day and night held on indignantly</line>
      <line>O’er the blue Midland waters with the gale,</line>
      <line>Betwixt the Syrtes and soft Sicily,</line>
      <line>To where the Atlantic raves</line>
      <line>Outside the western straits; and unbent sails</line>
      <line>There, where down cloudy cliffs, through sheets of foam,</line>
      <line>Shy traffickers, the dark Iberians come;</line>
      <line>And on the beach undid his corded bales.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>What is it to grow old?</line>
      <line>Is it to lose the glory of the form,</line>
      <line>The lustre of the eye?</line>
      <line>Is it for beauty to forego her wreath?</line>
      <line>—Yes, but not this alone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is it to feel our strength—</line>
      <line>Not our bloom only, but our strength—decay?</line>
      <line>Is it to feel each limb</line>
      <line>Grow stiffer, every function less exact,</line>
      <line>Each nerve more loosely strung?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, this, and more; but not</line>
      <line>Ah, ’tis not what in youth we dream’d ’twould be!</line>
      <line>’Tis not to have our life</line>
      <line>Mellow’d and soften’d as with sunset-glow,</line>
      <line>A golden day’s decline.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis not to see the world</line>
      <line>As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes,</line>

      <line>And weep, and feel the fulness of the past,</line>
      <line>The years that are no more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is to spend long days</line>

      <line>It is to add, immured</line>

      <line>To month with weary pain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is to suffer this,</line>
      <line>And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel.</line>
      <line>Deep in our hidden heart</line>
      <line>Festers the dull remembrance of a change,</line>
      <line>But no emotion—none.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is—last stage of all—</line>
      <line>When we are frozen up within, and quite</line>
      <line>The phantom of ourselves,</line>

      <line>Which blamed the living man.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Four years!—and didst thou stay above</line>
      <line>The ground, which hides thee now, but four?</line>
      <line>And all that life, and all that love,</line>
      <line>Were crowded, Geist! into no more?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Only four years those winning ways,</line>
      <line>Which make me for thy presence yearn,</line>
      <line>Call’d us to pet thee or to praise,</line>
      <line>Dear little friend! at every turn?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That loving heart, that patient soul,</line>
      <line>Had they indeed no longer span,</line>
      <line>To run their course, and reach their goal,</line>
      <line>And read their homily to man?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That liquid, melancholy eye,</line>
      <line>From whose pathetic, soul-fed springs</line>
      <line>Seem’d surging the Virgilian cry,</line>
      <line>The sense of tears in mortal things—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That steadfast, mournful strain, consoled</line>
      <line>By spirits gloriously gay,</line>
      <line>And temper of heroic mould—</line>
      <line>What, was four years their whole short day?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, only four!—and not the course</line>
      <line>Of all the centuries yet to come,</line>
      <line>And not the infinite resource</line>
      <line>Of Nature, with her countless sum</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Of figures, with her fulness vast</line>
      <line>Of new creation evermore,</line>
      <line>Can ever quite repeat the past,</line>
      <line>Or just thy little self restore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Stern law of every mortal lot!</line>
      <line>Which man, proud man, finds hard to bear,</line>
      <line>And builds himself I know not what</line>
      <line>Of second life I know not where.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But thou, when struck thine hour to go,</line>
      <line>On us, who stood despondent by,</line>
      <line>A meek last glance of love didst throw,</line>
      <line>And humbly lay thee down to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet would we keep thee in our heart—</line>
      <line>Would fix our favourite on the scene,</line>

      <line>And be as if thou ne’er hadst been.</line>

      <line>And so there rise these lines of verse</line>

      <line>We stroke thy broad brown paws again,</line>
      <line>We bid thee to thy vacant chair,</line>

      <line>We hear thy scuffle on the stair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We see the flaps of thy large ears</line>
      <line>Quick raised to ask which way we go;</line>
      <line>Crossing the frozen lake, appears</line>
      <line>Thy small black figure on the snow!</line>

      <line>Nor to us only art thou dear</line>
      <line>Who mourn thee in thine English home;</line>
      <line>Thou hast thine absent master’s tear,</line>
      <line>Dropt by the far Australian foam.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thy memory lasts both here and there,</line>
      <line>And thou shalt live as long as we.</line>
      <line>And after that—thou dost not care!</line>
      <line>In us was all the world to thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet, fondly zealous for thy fame,</line>
      <line>Even to a date, beyond our own</line>
      <line>We strive to carry down thy name,</line>
      <line>By mounded turf, and graven stone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We lay thee, close within our reach,</line>
      <line>Here, where the grass is smooth and warm,</line>
      <line>Between the holly and the beech,</line>
      <line>Where oft we watch’d thy couchant form,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Asleep, yet lending half an ear</line>
      <line>To travellers on the Portsmouth road;—</line>
      <line>There build we thee, O guardian dear,</line>
      <line>Mark’d with a stone, thy last abode!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then some, who through this garden pass,</line>
      <line>When we too, like thyself, are clay,</line>
      <line>Shall see thy grave upon the grass,</line>
      <line>And stop before the stone, and say:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>People who lived here long ago</line>
      <line>Did by this stone, it seems, intend</line>
      <line>To name for future times to know</line>
      <line>The dachs-hound, Geist, their little friend.</line>

      <line>On they pass’d, and on they pass’d;</line>

      <line>Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak too;</line>

      <line>A long, long crowd—where each seem’d lonely,</line>

      <line>Raised a head or look’d my way:</line>
      <line>She linger’d a moment,—she might not stay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How long since I saw that fair pale face!</line>
      <line>Ah! Mother dear! might I only place</line>
      <line>My head on thy breast, a moment to rest,</line>
      <line>While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On, on, a moving bridge they made</line>

      <line>Many long-forgot, but remember’d then.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And first there came a bitter laughter;</line>
      <line>A sound of tears the moment after;</line>
      <line>And then a music so lofty and gay,</line>
      <line>That every morning, day by day,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>A florin to the willing Guard</line>
      <line>Secured, for half the way,</line>
      <line>(He lock’d us in, ah, lucky-starr’d,)</line>
      <line>A curtain’d, front coupe.</line>
      <line>The sparkling sun of August shone;</line>
      <line>The wind was in the West;</line>
      <line>Your gown and all that you had on</line>
      <line>Was what became you best;</line>
      <line>And we were in that seldom mood</line>
      <line>When soul with soul agrees,</line>
      <line>Mingling, like flood with equal flood,</line>
      <line>In agitated ease.</line>
      <line>Far round, each blade of harvest bare</line>
      <line>Its little load of bread;</line>
      <line>Each furlong of that journey fair</line>
      <line>With separate sweetness sped.</line>
      <line>The calm of use was coming o’er</line>
      <line>The wonder of our wealth,</line>
      <line>And now, maybe, ’twas not much more</line>
      <line>Than Eden’s common health.</line>
      <line>We paced the sunny platform, while</line>
      <line>The train at Havant changed:</line>
      <line>What made the people kindly smile,</line>
      <line>Or stare with looks estranged?</line>
      <line>Too radiant for a wife you seem’d,</line>
      <line>Serener than a bride;</line>
      <line>Me happiest born of men I deem’d,</line>
      <line>And show’d perchance my pride.</line>
      <line>I loved that girl, so gaunt and tall,</line>
      <line>Who whispered loud, ‘Sweet Thing!’</line>
      <line>Scanning your figure, slight yet all</line>
      <line>Round as your own gold ring.</line>
      <line>At Salisbury you stray’d alone</line>
      <line>Within the shafted glooms,</line>
      <line>Whilst 1 was by the Verger shown</line>
      <line>The brasses and the tombs.</line>
      <line>At tea we talk’d of matters deep,</line>
      <line>Of joy that never dies;</line>
      <line>We laugh’d, till love was mix’d with sleep</line>
      <line>Within your great sweet eyes.</line>
      <line>The next day, sweet with luck no less</line>
      <line>And sense of sweetness past,</line>
      <line>The full tide of our happiness</line>
      <line>Rose higher than the last.</line>
      <line>At Dawlish, ’mid the pools of brine,</line>
      <line>You stept from rock to rock,</line>
      <line>One hand quick tightening upon mine,</line>
      <line>One holding up your frock.</line>
      <line>On starfish and on weeds alone</line>
      <line>You seem’d intent to be:</line>
      <line>Flash’d those great gleams of hope unknown</line>
      <line>From you, or from the sea?</line>
      <line>Ne’er came before, ah, when again</line>
      <line>Shall come two days like these:</line>
      <line>Such quick delight within the brain,</line>
      <line>Within the heart such peace?</line>
      <line>I thought, indeed, by magic chance,</line>
      <line>A third from Heaven to win,</line>
      <line>But as, at dusk, we reach’d Penzance,</line>
      <line>A drizzling rain set in.</line>

    <title>The Toys</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>My little Son, who look’d from thoughtful eyes</line>
      <line>And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,</line>
      <line>Having my law the seventh time disobey’d,</line>
      <line>I struck him, and dismiss’d</line>
      <line>With hard words and unkiss’d,</line>
      <line>His Mother, who was patient, being dead.</line>
      <line>Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,</line>
      <line>I visited his bed,</line>
      <line>But found him slumbering deep,</line>
      <line>With darken’d eyelids, and their lashes yet</line>
      <line>From his late sobbing wet.</line>
      <line>And I, with moan,</line>
      <line>Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;</line>
      <line>For, on a table drawn beside his head,</line>
      <line>He had put, within his reach,</line>
      <line>A box of counters and a red-vein’d stone,</line>
      <line>A piece of glass abraded by the beach</line>
      <line>And six or seven shells,</line>
      <line>A bottle with bluebells</line>
      <line>And two French copper coins, ranged there with careful art,</line>
      <line>To comfort his sad heart.</line>
      <line>So when that night I pray’d</line>
      <line>To God, I wept, and said:</line>
      <line>Ah, when at last we lie with tranced breath,</line>
      <line>Not vexing Thee in death,</line>
      <line>And Thou rememberest of what toys</line>
      <line>We made our joys,</line>
      <line>How weakly understood,</line>
      <line>Thy great commanded good,</line>
      <line>Then, fatherly not less</line>
      <line>Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,</line>
      <line>Thou’It leave Thy wrath, and say,</line>
      <line>‘I will be sorry for their childishness.’</line>

      <line>Is all antiquity and no decay.</line>

      <line>And sweet economy of sweet,</line>
      <line>And odours that remind</line>
      <line>Of haunts of childhood and a different day.</line>

      <line>Praising no Gods nor blaming, sans a wish,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I DREAMT one night—it was a horrid dream—</line>
      <line>That I was dead, and made was the division</line>
      <line>Between the innocent flesh and guilty spirit,</line>
      <line>And that the former, with a white sheet wrapt round</line>
      <line>And nailed up in a box, was to the bottom</line>
      <line>Sunk of a deep and narrow pit, which straight</line>
      <line>Was filled to overheaping with a mixture</line>
      <line>Of damp clay, rotting flesh and mouldering bones,</line>
      <line>And lidded with a weighty stone whereon</line>
      <line>Was writ my name and on what days precise</line>
      <line>I first and last drew breath; while up the latter</line>
      <line>Flew, without help of wings or fins or members,</line>
      <line>By its mere lightness, through the air, to heaven;</line>
      <line>And there being placed before the judgment-seat</line>
      <line>Of its Maker, and most unsatisfactory</line>
      <line>Answer returning to the question:—‘Wherefore</line>
      <line>Wast thou as I made thee?’ was sent down</line>
      <line>Tumbling by its own weight, down down to Hell,</line>

      <line>With printed list of questions in his hand:</line>
      <line>My name and age and birthplace and religion,</line>
      <line>Trade or profession, wherefore I had come,</line>
      <line>How long to stay, whither next bound, and so forth;</line>
      <line>All at my peril to be truly answered,</line>
      <line>And upon each a sixpence to the State,</line>
      <line>Which duly paid I should obtain permission</line>
      <line>To stay where I was so long as the State pleased,</line>
      <line>Without being prosecuted as a felon,</line>
      <line>Spy, or disturber of the public peace.</line>

      <line>At six years old I had before mine eyes</line>
      <line>A picture painted, like the rainbow, bright,</line>

      <line>With all my childish heart I longed to reach it,</line>

      <line>Advancing with slow step some few short yards</line>
      <line>But not perceptibly the distance lessening.</line>
      <line>At threescore years old, when almost within</line>
      <line>Grasp of my outstretched arms the selfsame picture</line>
      <line>With all its beauteous colors painted bright,</line>
      <line>I’m backward from it further borne each day</line>
      <line>By an invisible, compulsive force,</line>
      <line>Gradual but yet so steady, sure, and rapid,</line>

      <line>Feeling, as ’twere, my way in the new world</line>

      <line>He’s gone to bed at last, that flaring, glaring,</line>
      <line>Round, red-faced, bold, monopolizing Sun,</line>
      <line>And I may venture from their hiding-place</line>
      <line>To bring my pair of stearine candles forth</line>
      <line>And set them, firmly stayed, upon my table,</line>
      <line>To illuminate and cheer my studious evening.</line>
      <line>Thou hast my praise, Prometheus, for thy theft,</line>
      <line>And, were I to idolatry addicted,</line>
      <line>Shouldst be my God in preference to Buddh,</line>
      <line>Brahma, or Thor, or Odin, or Jove’s self.</line>
      <line>Her of the olive branch I’d hold to thee</line>
      <line>The next in honor, and before her shrine</line>
      <line>In gratitude would keep for ever burning</line>
      <line>A lamp of such Athenian oil as Plato,</line>
      <line>Demosthenes, Pythagoras, and Solon</line>
      <line>Were wont in bed to read by, after midnight.</line>

      <line>Which neither flickers nor offends the nostrils,</line>
      <line>Nor from the distance of a thousand miles,</line>
      <line>Or thousand years, or both perhaps, keeps ever</line>
      <line>And anon calling me—like some bold child</line>
      <line>The mother’s hand—to come and snuff and snub it;</line>
      <line>But steady, cleanly, bright and inodorous,</line>
      <line>Than tallow more humane, than wax less costly,</line>
      <line>Gives me just what I want, and asks back nothing.</line>

      <line>Once on a time a thousand different men</line>
      <line>Together knelt before as many Gods</line>
      <line>Each from the other different as themselves</line>
      <line>Were different each from each, yet didn’t fall out,</line>
      <line>Or cut each others’ throats amidst their prayers—</line>
      <line>‘Stop there! that never happened, or, if it did,</line>

      <line>Really and in the way of nature, tell me</line>

      <line>Not even the Gods; I’ll tell thee how it was;</line>
      <line>But art thou trusty? canst thou keep the secret?</line>
      <line>‘Yes yes.’ Then in thine ear: the thousand Gods</line>
      <line>Had all the selfsame name; so every God,</line>
      <line>Hearing no name invoked except his own,</line>
      <line>Believed that every man of all the thousand</line>
      <line>Worshipped him only; while each one of all</line>
      <line>The thousand worshippers, hearing no name</line>

      <line>Two hundred men and eighteen killed</line>
      <line>For want of a second door!</line>
      <line>Ay, for with two doors, each ton coal</line>
      <line>Had cost one penny more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And what is it else makes England great,</line>
      <line>At home, by land, by sea,</line>
      <line>But her cheap coal, and eye’s tail turned</line>
      <line>Toward strict economy?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But if a slate falls off the roof</line>
      <line>And kills a passer-by,</line>
      <line>Or if a doctor’s dose too strong</line>
      <line>Makes some half-dead man die,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We have coroners and deodands</line>
      <line>And inquests, to no end,</line>
      <line>And every honest Englishman’s</line>
      <line>The hapless sufferer’s friend,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And householder’s or doctor’s foe,</line>
      <line>For he has nought to lose,</line>
      <line>And fain will, if he can, keep out</line>
      <line>Of that poor dead man’s shoes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But if of twice a hundred men,</line>
      <line>And eighteen more, the breath</line>

      <line>In a coal pit to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Besides, ’twould cost a thousand times</line>
      <line>As much, or something more,</line>
      <line>To make to every pit of coal</line>
      <line>A second, or safety door,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As all the shrouds and coffins cost</line>
      <line>For those who perish now</line>
      <line>For want of a second door, and that’s</line>
      <line>No trifle, you’ll allow;</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>And trade must live, though now and then</line>
      <line>A man or two may die;</line>

      <line>And, Jenny, let each widow have</line>
      <line>A cup of congo strong,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>With prayer to God to keep coal cheap,</line>
      <line>Both cheap and plenty too,</line>

      <line>What is it to me or you?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For though we’re mortal too, no doubt,</line>
      <line>And Death for us his sithe</line>
      <line>Has ready still, the chance is small</line>
      <line>We ever die of stithe.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And if we do, our gracious Queen</line>
      <line>Will, sure, a telegram send,</line>
      <line>To say how sore she grieves for us</line>
      <line>And our untimely end;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And out of her own privy purse</line>
      <line>A sovereign down will pay,</line>
      <line>To have us decently interred</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And burial service shall for us</line>
      <line>In the churchyard be read,</line>
      <line>And more bells rung and more hymns sung</line>
      <line>Than if we had died in bed:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For such an accident as this</line>
      <line>May never occur again,</line>

      <line>On a low stool by the fire,</line>

      <line>Perhaps will do so all the night,</line>
      <line>On an unused rhyme for ‘scan,’</line>

      <line>Miss Temple pets the little hound,</line>
      <line>That has a tendency to whine,</line>
      <line>To-night its cushion can’t be found;</line>
      <line>And wonders when they’ll leave the wine</line>
      <line>Few take, but which men still combine</line>

      <line>Indeed a frightful interval!</line>

      <line>She plays, that laughter-loving fool?</line>
      <line>The funeral march, Dead March of Saul!</line>

      <line>Oh, Lord of Hosts! their mailed tread,</line>

      <line>Never underneath the sun</line>
      <line>With this heart-fathoming march be done;</line>
      <line>Still, Lord of Hosts! to Thee we cry,</line>
      <line>When our great ones, loved ones, die,</line>
      <line>Still some grand lament we crave,</line>
      <line>When we descend into the grave.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I turn, afraid that I may weep,—</line>

      <line>Dear old Ions was asleep.</line>

      <line>Dreaming when Dawn’s Left Hand was in the Sky</line>

      <line>And many Knots unravel’d by the Road;</line>
      <line>But not the Knot of Human Death and Fate.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>There was a Door to which I found no Key:</line>
      <line>There was a Veil past which I could not see:</line>
      <line>Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee</line>
      <line>There seemed—and then no more of Thee and Me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then to the rolling Heav’n itself I cried,</line>
      <line>Asking, ‘What Lamp had Destiny to guide</line>
      <line>‘Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?’</line>
      <line>And—‘A blind Understanding!’ Heav’n replied.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjourn</line>
      <line>My Lip the secret Well of Life to learn:</line>
      <line>And Lip to Lip it murmur’d—‘While you live</line>
      <line>‘Drink!—for once dead you never shall return.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I think the Vessel, that with fugitive</line>
      <line>Articulation answer’d, once did live,</line>
      <line>And merry-make; and the cold Lip I kiss’d</line>
      <line>How many Kisses might it take—and give!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,</line>
      <line>I watch’d the Potter thumping his wet Clay:</line>
      <line>And with its all obliterated Tongue</line>
      <line>It murmur’d—‘Gently, Brother, gently, pray!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, fill the Cup:—what boots it to repeat</line>
      <line>How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:</line>
      <line>Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,</line>
      <line>Why fret about them if To-day be sweet!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One Moment in Annihilation’s Waste,</line>
      <line>One Moment, of the Well of Life to taste—</line>
      <line>The Stars are setting and the Caravan</line>
      <line>Starts for the Dawn of Nothing—Oh, make haste!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How long, how long, in infinite Pursuit</line>
      <line>Of This and That endeavour and dispute?</line>
      <line>Better be merry with the fruitful Grape</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You know, my Friends, how long since in my House</line>
      <line>For a new Marriage I did make Carouse:</line>
      <line>Divorced old barren Reason from by Bed,</line>

      <line>He bid me taste of it; and ’twas—the Grape!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Grape that can with Logic absolute</line>
      <line>The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:</line>

      <line>Life’s leaden Metal into Gold transmute.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The mighty Mahmud, the victorious Lord,</line>

      <line>Scatters and slays with his enchanted Sword.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with me</line>
      <line>The Quarrel of the Universe let be:</line>

      <line>Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>For in and out, above, about, below,</line>

      <line>The Vine had struck a Fibre; which about</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Listen again. One Evening at the Close</line>
      <line>Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,</line>
      <line>In that old Potter’s Shop I stood alone</line>
      <line>With the clay Population round in Rows.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, strange to tell, among that Earthen Lot</line>
      <line>Some could articulate, while others not:</line>
      <line>And suddenly one more impatient cried—</line>
      <line>‘Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then said another—‘Surely not in vain</line>
      <line>‘My Substance from the common Earth was ta’en,</line>
      <line>‘That He who subtly wrought me into Shape</line>
      <line>‘Should stamp me back to common Earth again.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Another said—‘Why, ne’er a peevish Boy,</line>
      <line>‘Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy;</line>
      <line>‘Shall He that made the Vessel in pure Love</line>
      <line>‘And Fansy, in an after Rage destroy!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>None answer’d this; but after Silence spake</line>
      <line>A Vessel of a more ungainly Make:</line>
      <line>‘They sneer at me for leaning all awry;</line>
      <line>‘What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Said one—‘Folks of a surly Tapster tell,</line>
      <line>‘And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;</line>
      <line>‘They talk of some strict Testing of us—Pish!</line>
      <line>‘He’s a Good Fellow, and ’twill all be well.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,</line>
      <line>‘My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:</line>
      <line>‘But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,</line>
      <line>‘Methinks I might recover by-and-bye!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,</line>
      <line>One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:</line>
      <line>And then they jogg’d each other, ‘Brother! Brother!</line>
      <line>‘Hark to the Porter’s Shoulder-knot a-creaking!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,</line>
      <line>And wash my Body whence the Life has died,</line>
      <line>And in a Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,</line>
      <line>So bury me by some sweet Garden-side.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That ev’n my buried Ashes such a Snare</line>
      <line>Of Perfume shall fling up into the Air,</line>
      <line>As not a True Believer passing by</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Indeed the Idols I have loved so long</line>
      <line>Have done my Credit in Men’s Eye much wrong:</line>
      <line>Have drown’d my Honour in a shallow Cup,</line>
      <line>And sold my Reputation for a Song.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before</line>
      <line>I swore—but was I sober when I swore?</line>
      <line>And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand</line>
      <line>My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And much as Wine has play’d the Infidel,</line>
      <line>And robb’d me of my Robe of Honour—well,</line>
      <line>I often wonder what the Vintners buy</line>
      <line>One half so precious as the Goods they sell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!</line>
      <line>That Youth’s sweet-scented Manuscript should close!</line>
      <line>The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,</line>
      <line>Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire</line>
      <line>To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,</line>
      <line>Would not we shatter it to bits—and then</line>
      <line>Re-mould it nearer to the Heart’s Desire!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, Moon of my Delight who know’st no wane,</line>
      <line>The Moon of Heav’n is rising once again:</line>
      <line>How oft hereafter rising shall she look</line>
      <line>Through this same Garden after me—in vain!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when Thyself with shining Foot shall pass</line>
      <line>Among the Guests Star-scatter’d on the Grass,</line>

      <line>Before we rivet the lid?’</line>
      <line>But I said, ‘I would rather not:</line>
      <line>For the look would never be hid</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘From my sight, day after day,</line>

      <line>So the mourners gather’d at last;</line>
      <line>And the poor dead body was put</line>

      <line>And the door of the hearse was shut.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And when the mourners were all</line>
      <line>In the coaches, ready to start,</line>

      <line>He smiled as well as he could;</line>
      <line>And the import of what he said</line>

      <line>He was ever my friend;</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>But, what a weight, O God!</line>
      <line>Was that one coffin to bear!</line>
      <line>Like a coffin of lead!</line>
      <line>And I carry it everywhere</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>About, wherever I go!</line>
      <line>If I lift the slightest thing,</line>
      <line>That requires an effort to lift,</line>
      <line>The effort at once will bring</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The whole weight into my hands,</line>
      <line>And I carry the corpse at the feet;</line>
      <line>And feel as if it would drop,</line>
      <line>And slip out of its winding-sheet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I have made a vow in my heart,</line>
      <line>Whatever the friends may say,</line>
      <line>Never to carry a corpse</line>
      <line>Again, to my dying day.</line>

      <line>I played with you ’mid cowslips blowing,</line>
      <line>When I was six and you were four;</line>
      <line>When garlands weaving, flower-balls throwing,</line>
      <line>Were pleasures soon to please no more.</line>
      <line>Through groves and meads, o’er grass and heather,</line>
      <line>With little playmates, to and fro,</line>
      <line>We wandered hand in hand together;</line>
      <line>But that was sixty years ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You grew a lovely roseate maiden,</line>
      <line>And still our early love was strong;</line>
      <line>Still with no care our days were laden,</line>
      <line>They glided joyously along;</line>
      <line>And I did love you, very dearly,</line>
      <line>How dearly words want power to show;</line>
      <line>I thought your heart was touched as nearly;</line>
      <line>But that was fifty years ago.</line>

      <line>Then other lovers came around you,</line>
      <line>Your beauty grew from year to year,</line>
      <line>And many a splendid circle found you</line>
      <line>The centre of its glittering sphere.</line>
      <line>I saw you then, first vows forsaking,</line>
      <line>On rank and wealth your hand bestow;</line>
      <line>Oh, then I thought my heart was breaking,—</line>
      <line>But that was forty years ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I lived on, to wed another:</line>
      <line>No cause she gave me to repine;</line>
      <line>And when I heard you were a mother,</line>
      <line>I did not wish the children mine.</line>
      <line>My own young flock, in fair progression,</line>
      <line>Made up a pleasant Christmas row:</line>

      <line>But that was thirty years ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You grew a matron plump and comely,</line>
      <line>You dwelt in fashion’s brightest blaze;</line>
      <line>My earthly lot was far more homely;</line>
      <line>But I too had my festal days.</line>
      <line>No merrier eyes have ever glistened</line>
      <line>Around the hearth-stone’s wintry glow,</line>

      <line>Time passed. My eldest girl was married,</line>

      <line>One pet of four years old I’ve carried</line>
      <line>Among the wild-flowered meads to play.</line>
      <line>In our old fields of childish pleasure,</line>
      <line>Where now, as then, the cowslips blow,</line>
      <line>She fills her basket’s ample measure,—</line>
      <line>And that is not ten years ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But though first love’s impassioned blindness</line>
      <line>Has passed away in colder light,</line>
      <line>I still have thought of you with kindness,</line>
      <line>And shall do, till our last good-night.</line>
      <line>The ever-rolling silent hours</line>
      <line>Will bring a time we shall not know,</line>
      <line>When our young days of gathering flowers</line>
      <line>Will be an hundred years ago.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Over the hill I have watched the dawning,</line>
      <line>I have watched the dawn of morning light,</line>
      <line>Because I cannot well sleep by night,</line>
      <line>Every day I have watched the dawning.</line>
      <line>And to-day very early my window shook</line>
      <line>With the cold wind fresh from the ghasdy brook,</line>
      <line>And I left my bed to watch the dawning.</line>
      <line>Very cold was the light, very pale, very still,</line>
      <line>And the wind blew great clouds over the hill</line>
      <line>Towards the wet place of the dying dawning;</line>
      <line>It blew them over towards the east</line>
      <line>In heavier charge as the light increased,</line>
      <line>From the very death of the dying dawning.</line>
      <line>Whence did the clouds come over the hill?</line>
      <line>I cannot tell, for no clouds did fill</line>
      <line>The clear space opposite the dawning</line>
      <line>Right over the hill, long, low, and pearl-grey,</line>
      <line>Set in the wind to live as it may;</line>
      <line>And as the light increased from the dawning,</line>
      <line>The cold, cold brook unto my seeming</line>
      <line>Did intermit its ghastly gleaming</line>
      <line>And ran forth brighter in the dawning.</line>
      <line>The wall-fruit stretched along the wall,</line>
      <line>The pear-tree waved its banners tall;</line>
      <line>Then close beside me in the dawning,</line>
      <line>I saw thy face so stonily grey,</line>
      <line>And the close lips no word did say,</line>
      <line>The eyes confessed not in the dawning.</line>
      <line>I saw a man ride through the light</line>
      <line>Upon the hill-top, out of sight</line>
      <line>Of me and thee and all the dawning.</line>

      <line>From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:</line>
      <line>The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.</line>
      <line>Well knew we that Life’s greatest treasure lay</line>
      <line>With us, and of it was our talk. ‘Ah, yes!</line>
      <line>Love dies!’ I said: I never thought it less.</line>

      <line>Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift</line>
      <line>Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:—</line>
      <line>Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!</line>

      <line>Warm-lighted looks, Love’s ephemerioe,</line>
      <line>Shoot gaily o’er the dishes and the wine.</line>

      <line>We three are on the cedar-shadowed lawn;</line>
      <line>My friend being third. He who at love once laughed,</line>
      <line>Is in the weak rib by a fatal shaft</line>
      <line>Struck through, and tells his passion’s bashful dawn</line>
      <line>And radiant culmination, glorious crown,</line>
      <line>When ‘this’ she said: went ‘thus’: most wondrous she.</line>
      <line>Our eyes grow white, encountering: that we are three,</line>
      <line>Forgetful; then together we look down.</line>
      <line>But he demands our blessing; is convinced</line>
      <line>That words of wedded lovers must bring good.</line>
      <line>We question; if we dare! or if we should!</line>
      <line>And pat him, with light laugh. We have not winced.</line>
      <line>Next, she has fallen. Fainting points the sign</line>
      <line>To happy things in wedlock. When she wakes,</line>
      <line>She looks the star that thro’ the cedar shakes:</line>
      <line>Her lost moist hand clings mortally to mine.</line>

      <line>Why did I come here in that dullard fit?</line>
      <line>I enter, and lie couched upon the floor.</line>
      <line>Passing, I caught the coverlet’s quick beat:—</line>
      <line>Come, Shame, burn to my soul! and Pride, and Pain—</line>
      <line>Foul demons that have tortured me, enchain!</line>
      <line>Out in the freezing darkness the lambs bleat.</line>
      <line>The small bird stiffens in the low starlight.</line>

      <line>You like not that French novel? Tell me why.</line>

      <line>Husband, and wife, and lover. She—but fie!</line>
      <line>In England we’ll not hear of it. Edmond,</line>
      <line>The lover, her devout chagrin doth share;</line>
      <line>Blanc-mange and absinthe are his penitent fare,</line>
      <line>Till his pale aspect makes her over-fond:</line>
      <line>So, to preclude fresh sin, he tries rosbif.</line>
      <line>Meantime the husband is no more abused:</line>
      <line>Auguste forgives her ere the tear is used.</line>
      <line>Then hangeth all on one tremendous If:—</line>
      <line>If she will choose between them. She does choose;</line>
      <line>And takes her husband, like a proper wife.</line>
      <line>Unnatural? My dear, these things are life:</line>

      <line>The dead man asked of them:</line>
      <line>‘Is the green land stained brown with flame?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Have they hewn my son for beasts to eat,</line>

      <line>Have they boiled my maid in a brass pan,</line>
      <line>And built a gallows to hang my man?’</line>

      <line>The boards said to him:</line>
      <line>‘This is a lewd thing that ye deem.</line>

      <line>Your wife has gotten a golden bed,</line>

      <line>Your man has gotten both ring and glove,</line>
      <line>Wrought well for eyes to love.’</line>

      <line>‘Flesh to feed hell’s worm upon.’</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear.</line>
      <line>Let us go hence together without fear;</line>
      <line>Keep silence now, for singing-time is over,</line>
      <line>And over all old things and all things dear.</line>
      <line>She loves not you nor me as all we love her.</line>
      <line>Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear,</line>
      <line>She would not hear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us rise up and part; she will not know.</line>
      <line>Let us go seaward as the great winds go,</line>
      <line>Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here?</line>
      <line>There is no help, for all these things are so,</line>
      <line>And all the world is bitter as a tear.</line>
      <line>And how these things are, though ye strove to show,</line>
      <line>She would not know.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us go home and hence; she will not weep.</line>
      <line>We gave love many dreams and days to keep,</line>
      <line>Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow,</line>
      <line>Saying ‘If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.’</line>
      <line>All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow;</line>
      <line>And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep,</line>
      <line>She would not weep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us go hence and rest; she will not love.</line>
      <line>She shall not hear us if we sing hereof,</line>
      <line>Nor see love’s ways, how sore they are and steep.</line>
      <line>Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough.</line>
      <line>Love is a barren sea, bitter and deep;</line>
      <line>And though she saw all heaven in flower above,</line>
      <line>She would not love.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us give up, go down; she will not care.</line>
      <line>Though all the stars made gold of all the air,</line>
      <line>And the sea moving saw before it move</line>
      <line>One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair;</line>
      <line>Though all those waves went over us, and drove</line>
      <line>Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair,</line>
      <line>She would not care.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see.</line>
      <line>Sing all once more together; surely she,</line>
      <line>She too, remembering days and words that were,</line>
      <line>Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we,</line>
      <line>We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there.</line>
      <line>Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me,</line>
      <line>She would not see.</line>

      <line>There is an end of joy and sorrow;</line>
      <line>Peace all day long, all night, all morrow,</line>
      <line>But never a time to laugh or weep.</line>
      <line>The end is come of pleasant places,</line>

      <line>Sleep, is it sleep perchance that covers</line>
      <line>Each face, as each face were his lover’s?</line>
      <line>Farewell; as men that sleep fare well.</line>
      <line>The grave’s mouth laughs unto derision</line>
      <line>Desire and dread and dream and vision,</line>

      <line>Good night, good sleep, good rest from sorrow</line>

      <line>Burnt spices flash, and burnt wine hisses,</line>

      <line>Yea, for their sake and in death’s favour</line>
      <line>Things of sweet shape and of sweet savour</line>

      <line>From boy’s pierced throat and girl’s pierced bosom</line>

      <line>Why will ye weep? what do ye weeping?</line>
      <line>For waking folk and people sleeping,</line>

      <line>The days rose-red, the poppied hours,</line>
      <line>Blood, wine, and spice and fire and flowers,</line>
      <line>There is one end of one and all.</line>

      <line>Shall such an one lend love or borrow?</line>

      <line>Shall these give thanks for words or breath?</line>
      <line>Their hate is as their loving-kindness;</line>
      <line>The frontlet of their brows is blindness,</line>
      <line>The armlet of their arms is death.</line>

      <line>Lo, for no noise or light of thunder</line>
      <line>Shall these grave-clothes be rent in sunder;</line>
      <line>He that hath taken, shall he give?</line>
      <line>He hath rent them: shall he bind together? 1</line>

      <line>He hath slain them: shall he bid them live?</line>

      <line>A little sorrow, a little pleasure,</line>
      <line>Fate metes us from the dusty measure</line>
      <line>That holds the date of all of us;</line>
      <line>We are born with travail and strong crying,</line>
      <line>And from the birth-day to the dying</line>
      <line>The likeness of our life is thus.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One girds himself to serve another,</line>
      <line>Whose father was the dust, whose mother</line>
      <line>The little dead red worm therein;</line>
      <line>They find no fruit of things they cherish;</line>
      <line>The goodness of a man shall perish,</line>
      <line>It shall be one thing with his sin.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In deep wet ways by grey old gardens</line>
      <line>Fed with sharp spring the sweet fruit hardens;</line>
      <line>They know not what fruits wane or grow;</line>
      <line>Red summer burns to the utmost ember;</line>
      <line>They know not, neither can remember,</line>
      <line>The old years and flowers they used to know.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, for their sakes, so trapped and taken,</line>
      <line>For theirs, forgotten and forsaken,</line>
      <line>Watch, sleep not, gird thyself with prayer.</line>
      <line>Nay, where the heart of wrath is broken,</line>
      <line>Where long love ends as a thing spoken,</line>
      <line>How shall thy crying enter there?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Though the iron sides of the old world falter,</line>
      <line>The likeness of them shall not alter</line>
      <line>For all the rumour of periods,</line>
      <line>The stars and seasons that come after,</line>
      <line>The tears of latter men, the laughter</line>
      <line>Of the old unalterable gods.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Far up above the years and nations,</line>
      <line>The high gods, clothed and crowned with patience,</line>
      <line>Endure through days of deathlike date;</line>
      <line>They bear the witness of things hidden;</line>
      <line>Before their eyes all life stands chidden,</line>
      <line>As they before the eyes of Fate.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not for their love shall Fate retire,</line>
      <line>Nor they relent for our desire,</line>
      <line>Nor the graves open for their call.</line>
      <line>The end is more than joy and anguish,</line>
      <line>Than lives that laugh and lives that languish,</line>
      <line>The poppied sleep, the end of all.</line>

      <line>Nothing is better, I well think,</line>
      <line>Than love; the hidden well-water</line>
      <line>Is not so delicate to drink:</line>
      <line>This was well seen of me and her.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I served her in a royal house;</line>
      <line>I served her wine and curious meat.</line>
      <line>For will to kiss between her brows,</line>
      <line>I had no heart to sleep or eat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Mere scorn God knows she had of me,</line>
      <line>A poor scribe, nowise great or fair,</line>
      <line>Who plucked his clerk’s hood back to see</line>
      <line>Her curled-up lips and amorous hair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I vex my head with thinking this.</line>
      <line>Yea, though God always hated me,</line>
      <line>And hates me now that I can kiss</line>
      <line>Her eyes, plait up her hair to see</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How she then wore it on the brows,</line>
      <line>Yet am I glad to have her dead</line>
      <line>Here in this wretched wattled house</line>
      <line>Where I can kiss her eyes and head.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nothing is better, I well know,</line>
      <line>Than love; no amber in cold sea</line>
      <line>Or gathered berries under snow:</line>
      <line>That is well seen of her and me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Three thoughts I make my pleasure of:</line>
      <line>First I take heart and think of this:</line>
      <line>That knight’s gold hair she chose to love,</line>
      <line>His mouth she had such will to kiss.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then I remember that sundawn</line>
      <line>I brought him by a privy way</line>
      <line>Out at her lattice, and thereon</line>
      <line>What gracious words she found to say.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>(Cold rushes for such little feet—</line>
      <line>Both feet could lie into my hand.</line>
      <line>A marvel was it of my sweet</line>
      <line>Her upright body could so stand.)</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace;</line>
      <line>Now am I clean and whole of shame,</line>
      <line>Nor shall men burn me in the face</line>
      <line>For my sweet fault that scandals them.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I tell you over word by word.</line>
      <line>She, sitting edgewise on her bed,</line>
      <line>Holding her feet, said thus. The third,</line>
      <line>A sweeter thing than these, I said.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>God, that makes time and ruins it</line>
      <line>And alters not, abiding God,</line>
      <line>Changed with disease her body sweet,</line>
      <line>The body of love wherein she abode.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love is more sweet and comelier</line>
      <line>Than a dove’s throat strained out to sing.</line>
      <line>All they spat out and cursed at her</line>
      <line>And cast her forth for a base thing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought</line>
      <line>This curse to plague her, a curse of his.</line>
      <line>Fools were they surely, seeing not</line>
      <line>How sweeter than all sweet she is.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He that had held her by the hair,</line>
      <line>With kissing lips blinding her eyes,</line>
      <line>Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare,</line>
      <line>Sigh under him, with short mad cries</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Out of her throat and sobbing mouth</line>
      <line>And body broken up with love,</line>
      <line>With sweet hot tears his lips were loth</line>
      <line>Her own should taste the savour of,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yea, he inside whose grasp all night</line>
      <line>Her fervent body leapt or lay,</line>
      <line>Stained with sharp kisses red and white,</line>
      <line>Found her a plague to spurn away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I hid her in this wattled house,</line>
      <line>I served her water and poor bread.</line>
      <line>For joy to kiss between her brows</line>
      <line>Time upon time I was nigh dead.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>Bread failed; we got but well-water</line>
      <line>And gathered grass with dropping seed.</line>
      <line>I had such joy of kissing her,</line>
      <line>I had small care to sleep or feed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sometimes when service made me glad</line>
      <line>The sharp tears leapt between my lids,</line>
      <line>Falling on her, such joy I had</line>
      <line>To do the service God forbids.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>‘I pray you let me be at peace,</line>
      <line>Get hence, make room for me to die.’</line>
      <line>She said that: her poor lip would cease,</line>
      <line>Put up to mine, and turn to cry.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I said, ‘Bethink yourself how love</line>
      <line>Fared in us twain, what either did;</line>
      <line>Shall I unclothe my soul thereof?</line>
      <line>That I should do this, God forbid.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yea, though God hateth us, he knows</line>
      <line>That hardly in a little thing</line>
      <line>Love faileth of the work it does</line>
      <line>Till it grow ripe for gathering.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Six months, and now my sweet is dead</line>
      <line>A trouble takes me; I know not</line>
      <line>If all were done well, all well said,</line>
      <line>No word or tender deed forgot.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Too sweet, for the least part in her,</line>
      <line>To have shed life out by fragments; yet,</line>
      <line>Could the close mouth catch breath and stir,</line>
      <line>I might see something I forget.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Six months, and I sit still and hold</line>
      <line>In two cold palms her cold two feet.</line>
      <line>Her hair, half grey half ruined gold,</line>
      <line>Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love bites and stings me through, to see</line>
      <line>Her keen face made of sunken bones.</line>
      <line>Her worn-off eyelids madden me,</line>
      <line>That were shot through with purple once.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She said, ‘Be good with me; I grow</line>
      <line>So tired for shame’s sake, I shall die</line>
      <line>If you say nothing:’ even so.</line>
      <line>And she is dead now, and shame put by.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yea, and the scorn she had of me</line>
      <line>In the old time, doubtless vexed her then.</line>
      <line>I never should have kissed her. See</line>
      <line>What fools God’s anger makes of men!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She might have loved me a little too,</line>
      <line>Had I been humbler for her sake.</line>
      <line>But that new shame could make love new</line>
      <line>She saw not—yet her shame did make.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I took too much upon my love,</line>
      <line>Having for such mean service done</line>
      <line>Her beauty and all the ways thereof,</line>
      <line>Her face and all the sweet thereon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yea, all this while I tended her,</line>
      <line>I know the old love held fast his part:</line>
      <line>I know the old scorn waxed heavier,</line>
      <line>Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It may be all my love went wrong—</line>
      <line>A scribe’s work writ awry and blurred,</line>
      <line>Scrawled after the blind evensong—</line>
      <line>Spoilt music with no perfect word.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But surely I would fain have done</line>
      <line>All things the best I could. Perchance</line>
      <line>Because I failed, came short of one,</line>
      <line>She kept at heart that other man’s.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I am grown blind with all these things:</line>
      <line>It may be now she hath in sight</line>
      <line>Some better knowledge; still there clings</line>
      <line>The old question. Will not God do right?</line>

      <line>Here, where the world is quiet;</line>
      <line>Here, where all trouble seems</line>
      <line>Dead winds’ and spent waves’ riot</line>
      <line>In doubtful dreams of dreams;</line>
      <line>I watch the green field growing</line>
      <line>For reaping folk and sowing,</line>
      <line>For harvest-time and mowing,</line>
      <line>A sleepy world of streams.</line>

      <line>Of what may come hereafter</line>

      <line>Wan waves and wet winds labour,</line>
      <line>Weak ships and spirits steer;</line>
      <line>They drive adrift, and whither</line>

      <line>No growth of moor or coppice,</line>

      <line>For dead men deadly wine.</line>

      <line>Pale, without name or number,</line>
      <line>In fruitless fields of corn,</line>
      <line>They bow themselves and slumber</line>
      <line>All night till light is born;</line>
      <line>And like a soul belated,</line>
      <line>In hell and heaven unmated,</line>
      <line>By cloud and mist abated</line>

      <line>In the end it is not well.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Pale, beyond porch and portal,</line>
      <line>Crowned with calm leaves, she stands</line>
      <line>Who gathers all things mortal</line>
      <line>With cold immortal hands;</line>
      <line>Her languid lips are sweeter</line>

      <line>She waits for each and other,</line>

      <line>The life of fruits and corn;</line>
      <line>And spring and seed and swallow</line>

      <line>There go the loves that wither,</line>
      <line>The old loves with wearier wings;</line>

      <line>Dead dreams of days forsaken,</line>
      <line>Blind buds that snows have shaken,</line>

      <line>Red strays of ruined springs.</line>

      <line>We are not sure of sorrow,</line>

      <line>To-day will die to-morrow;</line>
      <line>Time stoops to no man’s lure;</line>
      <line>And love, grown faint and fretful,</line>
      <line>With lips but half regretful</line>
      <line>Sighs, and with eyes forgetful</line>
      <line>Weeps that no loves endure.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>From too much love of living,</line>
      <line>From hope and fear set free,</line>
      <line>We thank with brief thanksgiving</line>
      <line>Whatever gods may be</line>
      <line>That no life lives for ever;</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,</line>
      <line>At the sea-down’s edge between windward and lee,</line>
      <line>Walled round with rocks as an inland island,</line>
      <line>The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.</line>
      <line>A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses</line>
      <line>The steep square slope of the blossomless bed</line>
      <line>Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses</line>
      <line>Now lie dead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,</line>
      <line>To the low last edge of the long lone land.</line>
      <line>If a step should sound or a word be spoken,</line>
      <line>Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest’s hand?</line>
      <line>So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,</line>
      <line>Through branches and briars if a man make way,</line>
      <line>He shall find no life but the sea-wind’s, restless</line>
      <line>Night and day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The dense hard passage is blind and stifled</line>
      <line>That crawls by a track none turn to climb</line>
      <line>To the strait waste place that the years have rifled</line>
      <line>Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.</line>
      <line>The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;</line>
      <line>The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.</line>
      <line>The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,</line>
      <line>These remain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;</line>
      <line>As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;</line>
      <line>From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,</line>
      <line>Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.</line>
      <line>Over the meadows that blossom and wither</line>
      <line>Rings but the note of a sea-bird’s song;</line>
      <line>Only the sun and the rain come hither</line>
      <line>All year long.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels</line>
      <line>One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.</line>
      <line>Only the wind here hovers and revels</line>
      <line>In a round where life seems barren as death.</line>
      <line>Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,</line>
      <line>Haply, of lovers none ever will know,</line>
      <line>Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping</line>
      <line>Years ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Heart handfast in heart as they stood, ‘Look thither,’</line>
      <line>Did he whisper? ‘look forth from the flowers to the sea;</line>
      <line>For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,</line>
      <line>And men that love lightly may die—but we?’</line>
      <line>And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,</line>
      <line>And or ever the garden’s last petals were shed,</line>
      <line>In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,</line>
      <line>Love was dead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?</line>
      <line>And were one to the end—but what end who knows?</line>
      <line>Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,</line>
      <line>As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.</line>
      <line>Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?</line>
      <line>What love was ever as deep as a grave?</line>
      <line>They are loveless now as the grass above them</line>
      <line>Or the wave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All are at one now, roses and lovers,</line>
      <line>Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.</line>
      <line>Not a breath of the time that has been hovers</line>
      <line>In the air now soft with a summer to be.</line>
      <line>Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter</line>
      <line>Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,</line>
      <line>When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter</line>
      <line>We shall sleep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here death may deal not again for ever;</line>
      <line>Here change may come not till all change end.</line>
      <line>From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,</line>
      <line>Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.</line>
      <line>Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,</line>
      <line>While the sun and the rain live, these shall be;</line>
      <line>Till a last wind’s breath upon all these blowing</line>
      <line>Roll the sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,</line>
      <line>Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,</line>
      <line>Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble</line>
      <line>The Helds that lessen, the rocks that shrink,</line>
      <line>Here now in his triumph where all things falter,</line>
      <line>Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,</line>
      <line>As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,</line>
      <line>Death lies dead.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Silence on silence treads at each low mom.</line>
      <line>Pain and new pain, some glimpse of painless sleep,</line>
      <line>And waking to old anguish and new day:</line>
      <line>Blasted of glory, sundered from my kind:</line>
      <line>My hearth, my realm, the lips that love me, lost:</line>
      <line>So runs it. ’Tis some courage to keep life</line>
      <line>Where life is worthless, and on feeble stay</line>
      <line>To dwell in hope of better till we die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I hate this island steep, this seam of beach.</line>
      <line>This ample desolation of gray rock</line>
      <line>Man tills not: and man reaps not, woe is me!</line>
      <line>No voices, save stress-landed mariners</line>
      <line>Leaning in ring with eyebrow-level wrists</line>
      <line>To watch the scummy rack and buzzing waves,</line>
      <line>Toss me a word in pity: stare and pass</line>
      <line>Grinding a clumsy jest or surly sneer.</line>
      <line>Yet in their talk I gather waifs and strays</line>
      <line>Of that great Trojan battle how it goes;</line>
      <line>Of beardless youths who gain down heaven with deeds,</line>
      <line>And all the noise and turmoil of the thing,</line>
      <line>Deed quenching deed, and echo’s swollen boast,</line>
      <line>While I am rotting here and touch no praise.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ye have done well to leave me. ’Tis most wise,</line>
      <line>And friendly too, expedient, generous:</line>
      <line>Why this is bounty’s crown; I have deserved</line>
      <line>No less than a sick hound: full thanks for all.</line>
      <line>My kings and comrades, ye are wise and brave,</line>
      <line>As wise as brave, and brave your chiefest voice</line>
      <line>Of foxy Ithaca: ’twas nobly said,</line>
      <line>‘Pack out the carrion on this leeward Isle.</line>
      <line>We need no wounded leaders, no, nor fear.</line>
      <line>His men and ships are needed; they sail on:</line>
      <line>They cannot heal him, and our need is great.’</line>
      <line>Why, man, this is true valour and no theft:</line>
      <line>I could not quit thee, and kings cannot steal.</line>
      <line>But if I meet thy foxship afterdays,</line>
      <line>With half an arm to raise and half a spear,</line>
      <line>I’ll mar that serpent face and false gray smile,</line>
      <line>And leave thy surgy rock without a king.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas, alas, how mean a thing am I</line>
      <line>To rail and threat and bluster like a God.</line>
      <line>The old pain trembles thro’ me marrow-deep,</line>
      <line>A quivering mass of earth, than earth no more,</line>
      <line>Earth gifted with a cunning power of pain,</line>
      <line>Full knowledge of its fall and loathsomeness,</line>
      <line>Craving for enterprize in impotence,</line>
      <line>Some little sleep and all the rest a pain—</line>
      <line>Shall such a thing have pride or hoard revenge?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I loathe the glancing sameness of this brine,</line>
      <line>Its hissing suck of waves, its equal face.</line>
      <line>I loathe the toss of sails, the pass of clouds,</line>
      <line>The white wings curving on the tawny rocks,</line>
      <line>The evening and the dawning and the day.</line>
      <line>We thrive by action, I am chained from all,</line>
      <line>And I forget the pleasure of this earth,</line>
      <line>Of all but pain and slow time dispossess’d.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet is there hope; slow hope yet comfort sure,</line>
      <line>I had forgot it in my wrath and pain.</line>
      <line>Is there no oracle? Troy cannot fall.</line>
      <line>I guard thine arrows, Heracles divine,</line>
      <line>And Troy falls not without them year on year.</line>
      <line>I hoard them as the marrow of my bones,</line>
      <line>Sweet nurses to revenge. Oh, fate is just.</line>
      <line>Ye reap, my kings, wound-harvest and much dead,</line>
      <line>Thinn’d troops, and kingdoms waned to wrack at home,</line>
      <line>And gloomy faces by a gloomy sea,</line>
      <line>And firm-braced Troy before, the sponge of toil,</line>
      <line>And all your warring as an idle dream.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I can abide my hour it is so sure,</line>
      <line>I lean on this unstumbling oracle,</line>
      <line>And nourish hope, till worn with many woes</line>
      <line>The haught Kings fall in thinking on the wreck</line>
      <line>They left by Lemnos and the archer hand</line>
      <line>Once fellowless in Hellas. They shall come,</line>
      <line>By Zeus I swear it, they shall come in shame,</line>
      <line>And stand in shame before the man they wrong’d</line>
      <line>And weeded out as refuse. See, they bend,</line>
      <line>Pestilent faces crusted in meek smiles,</line>
      <line>And supple eyes and all the fawn of need:</line>
      <line>And one mouths out on justice, gratitude,</line>
      <line>The cause of Hellas. Then another smooths</line>
      <line>My name with praise, and all the worthy ring</line>
      <line>Lisp sympathy with dew on glassy cheeks.</line>

    <title>The Power of Interval</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A fair girl tripping out to meet her love,</line>
      <line>Trimmed in her best, fresh as a clover bud.</line>
      <line>An old crone leaning at an ember’d fire,</line>
      <line>Short-breath’d in sighs and moaning to herself—</line>
      <line>And all the interval of stealing years</line>
      <line>To make that this, and one by one detach</line>
      <line>Some excellent condition; till Despair</line>
      <line>Faint at the vision, sadly, fiercely blinds</line>
      <line>Her burning eyes on her forgetful hands.</line>

    <title>The Knight in the Wood</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The thing itself was rough and crudely done,</line>
      <line>Cut in coarse stone, spitefully placed aside</line>
      <line>As merest lumber, where the light was worst</line>
      <line>On a back staircase. Overlooked it lay</line>
      <line>In a great Roman palace crammed with art.</line>
      <line>It had no number in the list of gems,</line>
      <line>Weeded away long since, pushed out and banished,</line>
      <line>Before insipid Guidos over-sweet</line>
      <line>And Dolce’s rose sensationalities,</line>
      <line>And curly chirping angels spruce as birds.</line>
      <line>And yet the motive of this thing ill-hewn</line>
      <line>And hardly seen did touch me. O, indeed,</line>
      <line>The skill-less hand that carved it had belonged</line>
      <line>To a most yearning and bewildered brain:</line>
      <line>There was such desolation in the work;</line>
      <line>And through its utter failure the thing spoke</line>
      <line>With more of human message, heart to heart,</line>
      <line>Than all these faultless, smirking, skin-deep saints,</line>
      <line>In artificial troubles picturesque,</line>
      <line>And martyred sweetly, not one curl awry—</line>
      <line>Listen; a clumsy knight, who rode alone</line>
      <line>Upon a stumbling jade in a great wood</line>
      <line>Belated. The poor beast with head low-bowed</line>
      <line>Snuffing the treacherous ground. The rider leant</line>
      <line>Forward to sound the marish with his lance.</line>
      <line>You saw the place was deadly; that doomed pair,</line>
      <line>The wretched rider and the hide-bound steed,</line>
      <line>Feared to advance, feared to return—That’s all!</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Sigh, heart, and break not; rest, lark, and wake not!</line>
      <line>Day I hear coming to draw my Love away.</line>
      <line>As mere-waves whisper, and clouds grow crisper,</line>
      <line>Ah, like a rose he will waken up with day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In moon-light lonely, he is my Love only,</line>
      <line>I share with none when Luna rides in grey.</line>

      <line>The light and deed and turmoil of the day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To watch my sleeper to me is sweeter,</line>
      <line>Than any waking words my Love can say;</line>
      <line>In dream he finds me and closer winds me!</line>
      <line>Let him rest by me a little more and stay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, mine eyes, close not: and, tho’ he knows not,</line>
      <line>My lips, on his be tender while you may;</line>
      <line>Ere leaves are shaken, and ring-doves waken,</line>
      <line>And infant buds begin to scent new day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Fair Darkness, measure thine hours, as treasure</line>
      <line>Shed each one slowly from thine urn, I pray;</line>
      <line>Hoard in and cover each from my lover;</line>
      <line>I cannot lose him yet; dear night, delay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Each moment dearer, true-love, lie nearer,</line>
      <line>My hair shall blind thee lest thou see the ray;</line>
      <line>My locks encumber thine ears in slumber,</line>
      <line>Lest any bird dare give thee note of day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He rests so calmly; we lie so warmly;</line>
      <line>Hand within hand, as children after play;—</line>
      <line>In shafted amber on roof and chamber</line>
      <line>Dawn enters; my Love wakens; here is day.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>My Love lies in the gates of foam,</line>
      <line>The last dear wreck of shore;</line>
      <line>The naked sea-marsh binds her home,</line>
      <line>The sand her chamber door.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The grey gull flaps the written stones,</line>

      <line>Great ships at anchor ride.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Black piers with crust of dripping green,</line>
      <line>One foreland, like a hand,</line>
      <line>O’er intervals of grass between</line>
      <line>Dim lonely dunes of sand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A church of silent weathered looks,</line>
      <line>A breezy reddish tower,</line>
      <line>A yard whose mounded resting-nooks</line>
      <line>Are tinged with sorrel flower.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In peace the swallow’s eggs are laid</line>
      <line>Along the belfry walls;</line>
      <line>The tempest does not reach her shade,</line>
      <line>The rain her silent halls.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But sails are sweet in summer sky,</line>
      <line>The lark throws down a lay;</line>
      <line>The long salt levels steam and dry,</line>
      <line>The cloud-heart melts away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But patches of the sea-pink shine,</line>
      <line>The pied crows poise and come;</line>
      <line>The mallow hangs, the bindweeds twine,</line>
      <line>Where her sweet lips are dumb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The passion of the wave is mute;</line>
      <line>No sound or ocean shock;</line>
      <line>No music save the trilling flute</line>
      <line>That marks the curlew flock.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But yonder when the wind is keen,</line>
      <line>And rainy air is clear,</line>
      <line>The merchant city’s spires are seen,</line>
      <line>The toil of men grows near.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Along the coast-way grind the wheels</line>
      <line>Of endless carts of coal;</line>

      <line>The shipyard hammers roll.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The world creeps here upon the shout,</line>
      <line>And stirs my heart in pain;</line>
      <line>The mist descends and blots it out,</line>
      <line>And I am strong again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Strong and alone, my dove, with thee;</line>
      <line>And, tho’ mine eyes be wet,</line>

      <line>So dear as my regret.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I would not change my sorrow, sweet,</line>

      <line>I love the daisies at thy feet</line>
      <line>More than their orange flowers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My hand alone shall tend thy tomb</line>
      <line>From leaf-bud to leaf-fall,</line>
      <line>And wreathe around each season’s bloom</line>
      <line>Till autumn ruins all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Let snowdrops, early in the year,</line>
      <line>Droop o’er her silent breast;</line>
      <line>And bid the later cowslip rear</line>
      <line>The amber of its crest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Come hither, linnets tufted-red,</line>
      <line>Drift by, O wailing tern;</line>
      <line>Set pure vale lilies at her head,</line>
      <line>At her feet lady-fern.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Grow, samphire, at the tidal brink,</line>
      <line>Wave, pansies of the shore,</line>
      <line>To whisper how alone I think</line>
      <line>Of her for evermore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Bring blue sea-hollies thorny, keen,</line>
      <line>Long lavender in flower;</line>
      <line>Grey wormwood like a hoary queen,</line>
      <line>Stanch mullein like a tower.</line>

      <line>Let iron bounds be thine;</line>
      <line>Nor let the salt wave overflow</line>
      <line>That breast I held divine.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nor float its sea-weed to her hair,</line>
      <line>Nor dim her eyes with sands:</line>
      <line>No fluted cockle burrow where</line>
      <line>Sleep folds her patient hands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Tho’ thy crest feel the wild sea’s breath,</line>
      <line>Tho’ tide-weight tear thy root,</line>

      <line>Has bound my darling mute.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Tho’ cold her pale lips to reward</line>
      <line>With Love’s own mysteries,</line>

      <line>Rough gale of eastern seas!</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>Ah, render sere no silken bent,</line>
      <line>That by her head-stone waves;</line>
      <line>Let noon and golden summer blent</line>
      <line>Pervade these ocean graves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, ah, dear heart, in thy still nest,</line>
      <line>Resign this earth of woes,</line>
      <line>Forget the ardours of the west,</line>
      <line>Neglect the morning glows.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>Sleep, and forget all things but one,</line>

    <title>Circe</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>This the house of Circe, queen of charms—</line>
      <line>A kind of beacon-cauldron poised on high,</line>
      <line>Hooped round with ember-clasping iron bars,</line>
      <line>Sways in her palace porch, and smoulderingly</line>
      <line>Drips out in blots of fire and ruddy stars;</line>
      <line>But out behind that trembling furnace air,</line>
      <line>The lands are ripe and fair,</line>
      <line>Hush are the hills and quiet to the eye.</line>
      <line>The river’s reach goes by</line>
      <line>With lamb and holy tower and squares of corn,</line>
      <line>And shelving interspace</line>
      <line>Of holly bush and thorn,</line>
      <line>And hamlets happy in an Alpine morn,</line>
      <line>And deep-bowered lanes with grace</line>
      <line>Of woodbine newly born.</line>
      <line>But inward o’er the hearth a torch-head stands</line>
      <line>Inverted, slow green flames of fulvous hue,</line>
      <line>Echoed in wave-like shadows over her.</line>
      <line>A censer’s swing-chain set in her fair hands</line>
      <line>Dances up wreaths of intertwisted blue</line>
      <line>In clouds of fragrant frankincense and myrrh.</line>
      <line>A giant tulip head and two pale leaves</line>
      <line>Grew in the midmost of her chamber there,</line>
      <line>A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine,</line>
      <line>Rigid and bare,</line>
      <line>Gaunt as a tawny bond-girl born to shame,</line>
      <line>With freckled cheeks and splotched side serpentine,</line>
      <line>A gipsy among flowers,</line>
      <line>Unmeet for bed or bowers,</line>
      <line>Virginal where pure-handed damsels sleep:</line>
      <line>Let it not breathe a common air with them,</line>
      <line>Lest when the night is deep,</line>
      <line>And all things have their quiet in the moon,</line>
      <line>Some birth of poison from its leaning stem</line>
      <line>Waft in between their slumber-parted lips,</line>
      <line>And they cry out or swoon,</line>
      <line>Deeming some vampire sips,</line>
      <line>Where riper Love may come for nectar boon!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And near this tulip, reared across a loom,</line>
      <line>Hung a fair web of tapestry half done,</line>
      <line>Crowding with folds and fancies half the room:</line>
      <line>Men eyed as gods and damsels still as stone,</line>
      <line>Pressing their brows alone,</line>
      <line>In amethystine robes,</line>
      <line>Or reaching at the polished orchard globes,</line>
      <line>Or rubbing parted love-lips on their rind,</line>
      <line>While the wind</line>
      <line>Sows with sere apple leaves their breast and hair.</line>
      <line>And all the margin there</line>
      <line>Was arabesqued and bordered intricate</line>
      <line>With hairy spider things</line>
      <line>That catch and clamber,</line>
      <line>And salamander in his dripping cave</line>
      <line>Satanic ebon-amber;</line>
      <line>Blind worm, and asp, and eft of cumbrous gait,</line>
      <line>And toads who love rank grasses near a grave,</line>
      <line>And the great goblin moth, who bears</line>
      <line>Between his wings the ruined eyes of death;</line>
      <line>And the enamelled sails</line>
      <line>Of butterflies, who watch the morning’s breath.</line>
      <line>And many an emerald lizard with quick ears</line>
      <line>Asleep in rocky dales.</line>
      <line>And for an outer fringe embroidered small,</line>
      <line>A ring of many locusts, horny-coated,</line>
      <line>A round of chirping tree-frogs merry-throated,</line>
      <line>And sly, fat fishes sailing, watching all.</line>

      <line>Thou palace priest of treachery,</line>

      <line>How long, O lion, hast thou fleshless lain?</line>
      <line>What rapt thy fierce and thirsty eyes away?</line>
      <line>First came the vulture: worms, heat, wind, and rain</line>

      <line>I know not—if they spared it thee—how long</line>
      <line>The canker sate within thy monstrous mane,</line>
      <line>Till it fell piecemeal, and bestrew’d the plain;</line>
      <line>Or, shredded by the storming sands, was flung</line>
      <line>Again to earth; but now thine ample front,</line>
      <line>Whereon the great frowns gather’d, is laid bare;</line>
      <line>The thunders of thy throat, which erst were wont</line>
      <line>To scare the desert, are no longer there;</line>
      <line>Thy claws remain, but worms, wind, rain, and heat</line>

    <title>A Brilliant Day</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>O keen pellucid air! nothing can lurk</line>
      <line>Or disavow itself on this bright day;</line>
      <line>The small rain-plashes shine from far away,</line>
      <line>The tiny emmet glitters at his work;</line>
      <line>The bee looks blithe and gay, and as she plies</line>
      <line>Her task, and moves and sidles round the cup</line>
      <line>Of this spring flower, to drink its honey up,</line>
      <line>Her glassy wings, like oars that dip and rise,</line>
      <line>Gleam momently. Pure-bosom’d, clear of fog,</line>
      <line>The long lake glistens, while the glorious beam</line>
      <line>Bespangles the wet joints and floating leaves</line>
      <line>Of water-plants, whose every point receives</line>
      <line>His light; and jellies of the spawning frog,</line>
      <line>Unmark’d before, like piles of jewels seem!</line>

    <title>On a Vase of Gold-Fish</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The tortured mullet served the Roman’s pride</line>
      <line>By darting round the crystal vase, whose heat</line>
      <line>Ensured his woe and beauty till he died:</line>
      <line>These unharm’d gold-fish yield as rich a treat;</line>
      <line>Seen thus, in parlour-twilight, they appear</line>
      <line>As though the hand of Midas, hovering o’er,</line>
      <line>Wrought on the waters, as his touch drew near,</line>
      <line>And set them glancing with his golden power,</line>
      <line>The flash of transmutation! In their glass</line>
      <line>They float and glitter, by no anguish rackt;</line>
      <line>And, though we see them swelling as they pass,</line>
      <line>’Tis but a painless and phantasmal act,</line>
      <line>The trick of their own bellying walls, which charms</line>
      <line>All eyes—themselves it vexes not, nor harms.</line>

      <line>The hay has long been built into the stack</line>

      <line>To spend her snowy light upon the rack</line>
      <line>Of dark November, while her brother Sun</line>

      <line>In that cold section of the Zodiac:</line>
      <line>Far from the Lion, from the Virgin far!</line>
      <line>Then onward through the last dim month shall go</line>
      <line>The two great lights, to where the kalendar</line>
      <line>Splits the mid-winter; and the feathery snow</line>
      <line>Ushering another spring, with falling flakes</line>
      <line>Shall nurse the soil for next year’s scythes and rakes.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>The pigeons flutter’d fieldward, one and all,</line>
      <line>I saw the swallows wheel, and soar, and dive;</line>
      <line>The little bees hung poised before the hive,</line>
      <line>Even Partlet hoised herself across the wall:</line>
      <line>I felt my earth-bound lot in every limb,</line>
      <line>And, in my envious mood, I half-rebell’d;</line>
      <line>When lo! an insect cross’d the page I held,</line>
      <line>A little helpless minim, slight and slim;</line>
      <line>Ah! sure, there was no room for envy there,</line>
      <line>But gracious aid and condescending care;</line>
      <line>Alas! my pride and pity were misspent,</line>
      <line>The atom knew his strength, and rose in air!</line>
      <line>My gout came tingling back, as off he went,</line>
      <line>A wing was open’d at me everywhere!</line>

      <line>Alexander the Great</line>
      <line>This is the face of him, whose quick resource</line>
      <line>Of eye and hand subdued Bucephalus,</line>
      <line>And made the shadow of a startled horse</line>
      <line>A foreground for his glory. It is thus</line>
      <line>They hand him down; this coin of Philip’s son</line>
      <line>Recalls his life, his glories, and misdeeds;</line>
      <line>And that abortive court of Babylon,</line>
      <line>Where the world’s throne was left among the reeds.</line>
      <line>His dust is lost among the ancient dead,</line>
      <line>A coin his only presence: he is gone:</line>
      <line>And all but this half mythic image fled—</line>
      <line>A simple child may do him shame and slight;</line>
      <line>’Twixt thumb and finger take the golden head,</line>

      <line>When Letty had scarce pass’d her third glad year,</line>
      <line>And her young, artless words began to flow,</line>
      <line>One day we gave the child a colour’d sphere</line>
      <line>Of the wide earth, that she might mark and know,</line>
      <line>By tint and outline, all its sea and land.</line>
      <line>She patted all the world; old empires peep’d</line>
      <line>Between her baby fingers; her soft hand</line>
      <line>Was welcome at all frontiers. How she leap’d,</line>
      <line>And laugh’d, and prattled in her world-wide bliss;</line>
      <line>But when we turned her sweet unlearned eye</line>
      <line>On our own isle, she raised a joyous cry,</line>
      <line>‘Oh! yes, I see it, Letty’s home is there!’</line>
      <line>And, while she hid all England with a kiss,</line>
      <line>Bright over Europe fell her golden hair.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I hoard a little spring of secret tears,</line>
      <line>For thee, poor bird; thy death-blow was my crime:</line>
      <line>From the far past it has flow’d on for years;</line>
      <line>It never dries; it brims at swallow-time.</line>
      <line>No kindly voice within me took thy part,</line>
      <line>Till I stood o’er thy last faint flutterings;</line>
      <line>Since then, methinks, I have a gentler heart,</line>
      <line>And gaze with pity on all wounded wings.</line>
      <line>Full oft the vision of thy fallen head,</line>
      <line>Twittering in highway dust, appeals to me;</line>
      <line>Thy helpless form, as w'hen I struck thee dead,</line>
      <line>Drops out from every swallow-flight I see.</line>
      <line>I would not have thine airy spirit laid,</line>
      <line>I seem to love the little ghost I made.</line>

      <line>In the dim dawn on this bare head of mine,</line>
      <line>Which spreads a white and gleaming track for thee,</line>
      <line>When chairs and dusky wardrobes cease to shine.</line>
      <line>Though thou art irksome, let me not complain;</line>
      <line>Thy foolish passion for my hairless head</line>
      <line>Will spend itself, when these dark hours are sped,</line>
      <line>And thou shalt seek the sunlight on the pane.</line>
      <line>But still beware! thou art on dangerous ground:</line>
      <line>An angry sonnet, or a hasty hand,</line>
      <line>May slander thee, or crush thee: thy shrill sound</line>
      <line>And constant touch may shake my self-command:</line>
      <line>And thou mayst perish in that moment’s spite,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>He has not woo’d, but he has lost his heart.</line>
      <line>That country dance is a sore test for him;</line>
      <line>He thinks her cold; his hopes are faint and dim;</line>
      <line>But though with seeming mirth she takes her part</line>
      <line>In all the dances and the laughter there,</line>
      <line>And though to many a youth, on brief demand,</line>
      <line>She gives a kind assent and courteous hand,</line>
      <line>She loves but him, for him is all her care.</line>
      <line>With jealous heed her lessening voice he hears</line>
      <line>Down that long vista, where she seems to move</line>
      <line>Among fond faces and relays of love,</line>
      <line>And sweet occasion, full of tender fears:</line>
      <line>Down those long lines he watches from above,</line>
      <line>Till with the refluent dance she reappears.</line>

      <line>My heart, but you were dovewinged, I can tell,</line>

      <line>cogged, so cumbered,</line>

      <line>Far with fonder a care (and we, we should have lost it) finer, fonder</line>
      <line>A care kept.—Where kept? do but tell us where kept, where.—</line>

      <line>yonder, yonder,</line>

    <title>The Blessed Virgin compared to the Air we Breathe</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wild air, world-mothering air,</line>
      <line>Nestling me everywhere,</line>
      <line>That each eyelash or hair</line>
      <line>Girdles; goes home betwixt</line>
      <line>The fleeciest, frailest-flixed</line>
      <line>Snowflake; that’s fairly mixed</line>
      <line>With, riddles, and is rife</line>
      <line>In every least thing’s life;</line>
      <line>This needful, never spent,</line>
      <line>And nursing element;</line>
      <line>My more than meat and drink,</line>
      <line>My meal at every wink;</line>
      <line>This air, which, by life’s law,</line>
      <line>My lung must draw and draw</line>
      <line>Now but to breathe its praise,</line>
      <line>Minds me in many ways</line>
      <line>Of her who not only</line>
      <line>Gave God’s infinity</line>
      <line>Dwindled to infancy</line>
      <line>Welcome in womb and breast,</line>
      <line>Birth, milk, and all the rest</line>
      <line>But mothers each new grace</line>
      <line>That does now reach our race—</line>
      <line>Mary Immaculate,</line>
      <line>Merely a woman, yet</line>
      <line>Whose presence, power is</line>
      <line>Great as no goddess’s</line>
      <line>Was deemed, dreamed; who</line>
      <line>This one work has to do—</line>
      <line>Let all God’s glory through,</line>
      <line>God’s glory which would go</line>
      <line>Through her and from her flow</line>
      <line>Off, and no way but so.</line>
      <line>I say that we are wound</line>
      <line>With mercy round and round</line>
      <line>As if with air: the same</line>
      <line>Is Mary, more by name.</line>
      <line>She, wild web, wondrous robe,</line>
      <line>Mantles the guilty globe,</line>
      <line>Since God has let dispense</line>
      <line>Her prayers his providence:</line>
      <line>Nay, more than almoner,</line>
      <line>The sweet alms’ self is her</line>
      <line>And men are meant to share</line>
      <line>Her life as life does air.</line>
      <line>If I have understood,</line>
      <line>She holds high motherhood</line>
      <line>Towards all our ghostly good</line>
      <line>And plays in grace her part</line>
      <line>About man’s beating heart,</line>
      <line>Laying, like air’s fine flood,</line>
      <line>The deathdance in his blood;</line>
      <line>Yet no part but what will</line>
      <line>Be Christ our Saviour still.</line>
      <line>Of her flesh he took flesh:</line>
      <line>He does take fresh and fresh,</line>
      <line>Though much the mystery how,</line>
      <line>Not flesh but spirit now</line>
      <line>And makes, O marvellous!</line>
      <line>New Nazareths in us,</line>
      <line>Where she shall yet conceive</line>
      <line>Him, morning, noon, and eve;</line>
      <line>New Bethlems, and he born</line>
      <line>There, evening, noon, and morn—</line>
      <line>Bethlem or Nazareth,</line>
      <line>Men here may draw like breath</line>
      <line>More Christ and baffle death;</line>
      <line>Who, born so, comes to be</line>
      <line>New self and nobler me</line>
      <line>In each one and each one</line>
      <line>More makes, when all is done,</line>
      <line>Both God’s and Mary’s Son.</line>
      <line>Again, look overhead</line>
      <line>How air is azured;</line>
      <line>Oh how! Nay do but stand</line>
      <line>Where you can lift your hand</line>
      <line>Skywards: rich, rich it laps</line>
      <line>Round the four fingergaps.</line>
      <line>Yet such a sapphire-shot,</line>
      <line>Charged, steeped sky will not</line>
      <line>Stain light. Yea, mark you this:</line>
      <line>It does no prejudice.</line>
      <line>The glass-blue days are those</line>
      <line>When every colour glows,</line>
      <line>Each shape and shadow shows.</line>
      <line>Blue be it: this blue heaven</line>
      <line>The seven or seven times seven</line>
      <line>Hued sunbeam will transmit</line>
      <line>Perfect, not alter it.</line>
      <line>Or if there does some soft,</line>
      <line>On things aloof, aloft,</line>
      <line>Bloom breathe, that one breath more</line>
      <line>Earth is the fairer for.</line>
      <line>Whereas did air not make</line>
      <line>This bath of blue and slake</line>
      <line>His fire, the sun would shake,</line>
      <line>A blear and blinding ball</line>
      <line>With blackness bound, and all</line>
      <line>The thick stars round him roll</line>
      <line>Flashing like flecks of coal,</line>
      <line>Quartz-fret, or sparks of salt,</line>
      <line>In grimy vasty vault.</line>
      <line>So God was god of old:</line>
      <line>A mother came to mould</line>
      <line>Those limbs like ours which are</line>
      <line>What must make our daystar</line>
      <line>Much dearer to mankind;</line>
      <line>Whose glory bare would blind</line>
      <line>Or less would win man’s mind.</line>
      <line>Through her we may see him</line>
      <line>Made sweeter, not made dim,</line>
      <line>And her hand leaves his light</line>
      <line>Sifted to suit our sight.</line>
      <line>Be thou then, O thou dear</line>
      <line>Mother, my atmosphere;</line>
      <line>My happier world, wherein</line>
      <line>To wend and meet no sin;</line>
      <line>Above me, round me lie</line>
      <line>Fronting my froward eye</line>
      <line>With sweet and scarless sky;</line>
      <line>Stir in my ears, speak there</line>
      <line>Of God’s love, O live air,</line>
      <line>Of patience, penance, prayer:</line>
      <line>World-mothering air, air wild,</line>
      <line>Wound with thee, in thee isled,</line>
      <line>Fold home, fast fold thy child.</line>

      <line>I thought you knew I couldn’t help it;</line>
      <line>I could no more escape my woe</line>
      <line>Than Joseph could his empty well-pit.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It wasn’t fair of you at all:</line>
      <line>You moved so light and play’d so neatly,</line>
      <line>And set your foot upon the ball,</line>
      <line>And croquet’d me, I know, completely!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why did you let me look such things,</line>
      <line>And whisper o’er our melting ices,</line>
      <line>If converse with you only brings</line>
      <line>This most objectionable crisis?</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>I wish I had not loved, for then</line>
      <line>Perhaps you would not be offended,</line>

      <line>Oh yes! Sir John’s a charming catch—</line>
      <line>His stud, his balance at his banker’s,</line>
      <line>Unlike himself, are hard to match;</line>
      <line>And I have but one horse at Spanker’s!</line>

      <line>He will not house you in some den,</line>
      <line>Served by a footman single-handed—</line>

      <line>As your position, love, demanded:</line>

      <line>And so, I quite approve your choice;</line>
      <line>I won’t regret my wasted wooing;</line>
      <line>I’ll think your sweet soprano voice</line>
      <line>Has warn’d me from my own undoing:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And yet I know, that when too late—</line>
      <line>Just as the spectre came to Priam—</line>
      <line>You’ll learn to rue your splendid fate,</line>
      <line>And wish yourself as free as I am.</line>

    <title>Post Mortem</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I lay in my coffin under the sod;</line>
      <line>But the rooks they caw’d, and the sheep they trod</line>
      <line>And munch’d and bleated, and made such a noise—</line>
      <line>What with the feet of the charity boys</line>
      <line>Trampling over the old grave-stones—</line>
      <line>That it loosen’d my inarticulate bones,</line>
      <line>And chased my sleep away.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So I turn’d (for the coffin is not so full</line>
      <line>As it was, you know) my aching skull;</line>
      <line>And said to my wife—and it’s not my fault</line>
      <line>If she does lie next to me in the vault—</line>
      <line>Said to her kindly, ‘My love, my dear,</line>
      <line>How do you like these sounds we hear</line>
      <line>Over our heads to-day?’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My wife had always a good strong voice;</line>
      <line>But I’m not so sure that I did rejoice</line>
      <line>When I found it as strong as it used to be,</line>
      <line>And so unexpectedly close to me:</line>
      <line>I thought, if her temper should set in,</line>
      <line>Why, the boards between us are very thin,</line>
      <line>And whenever the bearers come one by one</line>
      <line>To deposit the corpse of my eldest son,</line>
      <line>Who is spending the earnings of his papa</line>
      <line>With such sumptuous ease and such great eclat,</line>
      <line>They may think it more pleasant, perhaps, than I did,</line>
      <line>To find that in death we were not divided.</line>
      <line>However, I trusted to time and the worms;</line>
      <line>And I kept myself to the mildest terms</line>
      <line>Of a conjugal How d’ye do.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘John,’ said my wife, ‘you’re a Body, like me;</line>
      <line>At least if you ain’t, why you ought to be;</line>
      <line>And I really don’t think, when I reflect,</line>
      <line>That I ought to pay as much respect</line>
      <line>To a rattling prattling skeleton</line>
      <line>As I did to a man of sixteen stone.</line>
      <line>However (says she), I shall just remark</line>
      <line>That this here place is so cool and dark,</line>
      <line>I’m certain sure, if you hadn’t have spoke,</line>
      <line>My slumber’d never have thus been broke;</line>
      <line>So I wish you’d keep your—voice in your head;</line>
      <line>For I don’t see the good of being dead,</line>
      <line>If one mayn’t be quiet too.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She spoke so clear and she spoke so loud,</line>
      <line>I thank’d my stars that a linen shroud</line>
      <line>And a pair of boards (though they were but thin)</line>
      <line>Kept out some part of that well-known din:</line>
      <line>And, talking of shrouds, the very next word</line>
      <line>That my empty echoing orbits heard</line>
      <line>Was, ‘Gracious me, I can tell by the feel</line>
      <line>That I’m all over rags from head to heel!</line>
      <line>Here’s jobs for needle and thread without ending,</line>
      <line>For there’s ever-so-many holes wants mending!’</line>
      <line>‘My love,’ I ventured to say, ‘I fear</line>
      <line>It’s not much use, your mending ’em here;</line>
      <line>For, as fast as you do, there’s worse than moth,</line>
      <line>And worse than mice, or rats, or both,</line>
      <line>Will eat up the work of your cotton ball</line>
      <line>And leave you never a shroud at all—</line>
      <line>No more than they have to me.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now, whether it was that she took it ill</line>
      <line>My seeming to question her feminine skill,</line>
      <line>Or whether ’twas simply that we were wedded—</line>
      <line>The very thing happen’d that most I dreaded:</line>
      <line>For, by way of reply, on the coffin-side,</line>
      <line>Just where the planks had started wide,</line>
      <line>There came a blow so straight and true</line>
      <line>That it shook my vertebral column in two;</line>
      <line>And what more might have follow’d I cannot tell,</line>
      <line>But that very minute (’twas just as well)</line>
      <line>The flagstone was lifted overhead,</line>
      <line>And the red-nosed buriers of the dead</line>
      <line>Let down a load on my coffin-plate</line>
      <line>That stunn’d me quite with the shock of its weight.</line>
      <line>’Twas the corpse, of course, of my eldest son,</line>
      <line>Who had injured his brain (a little one)</line>
      <line>By many a spirituous brain-dissolver,</line>
      <line>And finish’d it off with a Colt’s revolver.</line>
      <line>Well—when they had gone and the noise had ceased,</line>
      <line>I look’d for one other attack, at least:</line>
      <line>But, would you believe it? The place was quiet,</line>
      <line>And the worms had resumed their usual diet!</line>
      <line>Nay, everything else was silent too;</line>
      <line>The rooks they neither caw’d nor flew,</line>
      <line>And the sheep slept sound by footstone and head,</line>
      <line>And the charity boys had been whipp’d to bed.</line>
      <line>So I turn’d again, and I said to myself—</line>
      <line>‘Now, as sure as I’m laid on this sordid shelf</line>
      <line>Away from the living that smile or weep,</line>
      <line>I’ll sleep if I can, and let her too sleep:</line>
      <line>And I will not once, for pleasure or pain,</line>
      <line>Unhinge my jaws to speak again,</line>
      <line>No, not if she speaks to me.’</line>

    <title>The Fifteen Days of Judgment</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Then there shall be signs in Heaven.’—</line>
      <line>Thus much in the text is given,</line>
      <line>Worthy of the sinner’s heeding:</line>
      <line>But the other signs preceding</line>
      <line>Earth’s Last Judgment and destruction,</line>
      <line>And its fiery reconstruction,</line>
      <line>May be drawn from other channels;</line>
      <line>For we read in Hebrew annals</line>
      <line>That there shall be altogether</line>
      <line>Fifteen Judgment days; but whether</line>
      <line>Following or interpolated,</line>
      <line>Jerome saith, is nowhere stated.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the first day, loud upcrashing,</line>
      <line>Shall the shoreless ocean, gnashing</line>
      <line>With a dismal anaclysmal</line>
      <line>Outrush from its deeps abysmal,</line>
      <line>Lifted high by dread supernal,</line>
      <line>Storm the mountain heights eternal!</line>
      <line>Forty cubits of sheer edges,</line>
      <line>Wall-like, o’er the summit-ridges</line>
      <line>Stretching upright forth—a mirror</line>
      <line>For the unutterable terror</line>
      <line>Of the huddled howling nations,</line>
      <line>Smit with sudden desolations,</line>
      <line>Rushing hither, thither, drunken,</line>
      <line>Half their pleasant realms sea-sunken!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the second day, down-pouring,</line>
      <line>Shall the watery walls drop roaring</line>
      <line>From the ruinous precipices</line>
      <line>To the nethermost abysses,</line>
      <line>With a horrible waterquaking</line>
      <line>In the world-wide cataracts, shaking</line>
      <line>Earth’s foundations as they thunder</line>
      <line>To the cavernous darkness under.—</line>
      <line>Surf-plumed steeds of God Almighty,</line>
      <line>Rock and pyramid, forest, city,</line>
      <line>Through the flood-rent valleys scourging,</line>
      <line>Wild in headlong ebb down-surging,</line>
      <line>Down, till eye of man scarce reaches</line>
      <line>Where, within its shrunken beaches,</line>
      <line>Hidden from a world’s amazement,</line>
      <line>Cowers the Deep in self-abasement.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the third day, o’er the seething</line>
      <line>Of the leprous ocean writhing,</line>
      <line>Whale and dragon, ore and kraken,</line>
      <line>And leviathan, forsaken</line>
      <line>His unfathomable eyrie,</line>
      <line>To and fro shall plunge—the dreary</line>
      <line>Dumb death-sickness of creation</line>
      <line>Startling with their ululation.</line>
      <line>Men shall hear the monsters bellow</line>
      <line>Forth their burden, as they wallow;</line>
      <line>But its drift?—Let none demand it!</line>
      <line>God alone shall understand it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the fourth day, blazing redly,</line>
      <line>With a reek pitch-black and deadly,</line>
      <line>A consuming flame shall quiver</line>
      <line>From all seas and every river!</line>
      <line>Every brook and beck and torrent</line>
      <line>Leaping in a fiery current;</line>
      <line>All the moats and meres and fountains</line>
      <line>Lit, like beacons on the mountains;</line>
      <line>Furnace-roar of smolten surges</line>
      <line>Scaring earth’s extremest verges!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the fifth day, Judgment-stricken,</line>
      <line>Every green herb, from the lichen</line>
      <line>To the cedar of the forest,</line>
      <line>Shall sweat blood in anguish sorest!</line>
      <line>On the same, all fowls of heaven</line>
      <line>Into one wide field, fear-driven,</line>
      <line>Shall assemble, cowed and shrinking,</line>
      <line>Neither eating aught, nor drinking;</line>
      <line>Kind with kind, all ranked by feather,</line>
      <line>Doves with doves aghast together,</line>
      <line>Swan with swan in downfal regal,</line>
      <line>Wren with wren, with eagle, eagle!</line>
      <line>Ah! when fowl feel such foreboding,</line>
      <line>What shall be the Sinner’s goading?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the sixth day, through all nations</line>
      <line>Shall be quaking of foundations,</line>
      <line>With a horrible hollow rumbling—</line>
      <line>All that all men builded crumbling</line>
      <line>As the heel of Judgment tramples</line>
      <line>Cot and palace, castles, temples,</line>
      <line>Hall and minster, thorp and city;—</line>
      <line>All men too aghast for pity</line>
      <line>In the crashing and the crushing</line>
      <line>Of that stony stream’s downrushing!—</line>
      <line>And a flame of fiery warning</line>
      <line>Forth from sundown until morning</line>
      <line>With a lurid coruscation</line>
      <line>Shall reveal night’s desolation!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the seventh day, self-shattered,</line>
      <line>Rifting fourfold, scarred and scattered,</line>
      <line>Pounded in the Judgment’s mortars,</line>
      <line>Every stone shall split in quarters!</line>
      <line>Pebble, whinstone, granite sparry,</line>
      <line>Rock and boulder—stones of quarry,</line>
      <line>Shaped or shapeless, all asunder</line>
      <line>Shivering, split athwart and under;</line>
      <line>And the splinters, each on other,</line>
      <line>Shall make war against his brother,</line>
      <line>Each one grinding each to powder,</line>
      <line>Grinding, gnashing, loud and louder,</line>
      <line>Grinding, gnashing on till even,</line>
      <line>With a dolorous plea to Heaven.</line>
      <line>What the drift?—Let none demand it!</line>
      <line>God alone shall understand it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the eighth, in dire commotion,</line>
      <line>Shall the dry land heave like Ocean,</line>
      <line>Puffed in hills and sucked in hollows,</line>
      <line>Yawning into steep-down swallows—</line>
      <line>Swelling, mountainously lifted,</line>
      <line>Skyward from the plains uplifted—</line>
      <line>With a universal clamour,</line>
      <line>Rattling, roaring through the tremor;</line>
      <line>While, flung headlong, all men living</line>
      <line>Grovel in a wild misgiving!—</line>
      <line>What, O Sinner, shall avail your</line>
      <line>Might in solid Earth’s own failure!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the ninth day all the mountains</line>
      <line>Shall drop bodily, like spent fountains,</line>
      <line>All the cloud-capped pride of pristine</line>
      <line>Peak and pinnacle amethystine</line>
      <line>Toppling, drifting to the level,</line>
      <line>Flooding all the dales with gravel;</line>
      <line>One consummate moment blasting</line>
      <line>All that seems so everlasting—</line>
      <line>All men to the caves for shelter</line>
      <line>Scurrying through the world-wide welter!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the tenth day, hither, thither,</line>
      <line>Herding from their holes together,</line>
      <line>With a glaring of white faces,</line>
      <line>Through the desolate wildernesses</line>
      <line>Men shall o’er that mountain ruin</line>
      <line>Run as from a Death’s pursuing,—</line>
      <line>Each one with suspicious scowling,</line>
      <line>Shrinking from his fellow’s howling—</line>
      <line>For all human speech confounded</line>
      <line>Shall not sound as once it sounded.</line>
      <line>None shall understand his brother—</line>
      <line>Mother child, nor child his mother!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the eleventh day, at dawning,</line>
      <line>Every sepulchre wide yawning</line>
      <line>At the approach of Earth’s Assessor,</line>
      <line>Shall upyield its white possessor;—</line>
      <line>All the skeletons, close-serried,</line>
      <line>O’er the graves where each lay buried,</line>
      <line>Mute upstanding, white and bony,</line>
      <line>With a dreadful ceremony</line>
      <line>Staring from the morn till gloaming</line>
      <line>Eastward for the Judge’s coming;</line>
      <line>Staring on, with sockets eyeless,</line>
      <line>Each one motionless and cryless,</line>
      <line>Save the dry, dead-leaf-like chattering,</line>
      <line>Through that white-branched forest pattering.</line>
      <line>What its drift?—Let none demand it!</line>
      <line>God alone shall understand it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the twelfth, the Planets seven</line>
      <line>And all stars shall drop from Heaven!</line>
      <line>On the same day, scared and trembling,</line>
      <line>All four-footed things assembling,</line>
      <line>Each after his kind in order—</line>
      <line>All the lions in one border,</line>
      <line>Sheep with sheep—not needing shepherd—</line>
      <line>Stag with stag—with leopard, leopard—</line>
      <line>Shall be herded cowed and shrinking,</line>
      <line>Neither earing aught, nor drinking,</line>
      <line>But to Godward bellowing, shrieking,</line>
      <line>Howling, barking, roaring, squeaking;—</line>
      <line>What the drift?—Let none demand it!</line>
      <line>God alone shall understand it!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the thirteenth awful morning</line>
      <line>Shall go forth the latest warning,</line>
      <line>With a close to all things mortal,</line>
      <line>For the Judge is at the portal!</line>
      <line>In an agony superhuman,</line>
      <line>Every living man and woman,</line>
      <line>Child and dotard—every breather—</line>
      <line>Shall lie down and die together,</line>
      <line>That all flesh in death’s subjection</line>
      <line>May abide the Resurrection!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>On the fourteenth, morn to even,</line>
      <line>Fire shall feed on Earth and Heaven,</line>
      <line>Through the skies and all they cover,</line>
      <line>Under earth, and on, and over;</line>
      <line>All things ghostly, human, bestial,</line>
      <line>In the crucible celestial</line>
      <line>Tested by the dread purgation</line>
      <line>Of that final conflagration;</line>
      <line>Till the intolerable whiteness</line>
      <line>Dawn, of God’s exceeding brightness</line>
      <line>Through the furnace-flame’s erasure</line>
      <line>Of yon mortal veil of azure!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Last, the fifteenth day shall render</line>
      <line>Earth a more than earthly splendour,</line>
      <line>Once again shall Word be given:</line>
      <line>‘Let there be new Earth, new Heaven!’</line>
      <line>And this fleeting world—this charnel,</line>
      <line>Purified, shall wax eternal!—</line>
      <line>Then all souls shall Michael gather</line>
      <line>At the footstool of the Father,</line>
      <line>Summoning from Earth’s four corners,</line>
      <line>All erst human saints; and scorners,</line>
      <line>And without revenge or pity</line>
      <line>Weigh them in the scales almighty’!—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Sinner! Dost thou dread that trial?</line>
      <line>Mark yon shadow on the dial!</line>

      <line>Once in a saintly passion</line>
      <line>I cried with desperate grief,</line>
      <line>O Lord, my heart is black with guile,</line>
      <line>Of sinners I am chief.</line>
      <line>Then stooped my guardian angel</line>
      <line>And whispered from behind,</line>
      <line>‘Vanity, my little man,</line>
      <line>You’re nothing of the kind.’</line>

    <title>In the Room</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The sun was down, and twilight grey</line>
      <line>Filled half the air; but in the room,</line>
      <line>Whose curtain had been drawn all day,</line>
      <line>The twilight was a dusky gloom:</line>
      <line>Which seemed at first as still as death,</line>
      <line>And void; but was indeed all rife</line>
      <line>With subtle thrills, the pulse and breath</line>
      <line>Of multitudinous lower life.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In their abrupt and headlong way</line>
      <line>Bewildered flies for light had dashed</line>
      <line>Against the curtain all the day,</line>
      <line>And now slept wintrily abashed;</line>
      <line>And nimble mice slept, wearied out</line>
      <line>With such a double night’s uproar;</line>
      <line>But solid beetles crawled about</line>
      <line>The chilly hearth and naked floor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And so throughout the twilight hour</line>
      <line>That vaguely murmurous hush and rest</line>
      <line>There brooded; and beneath its power</line>
      <line>Life throbbing held its throbs supprest:</line>
      <line>Until the thin-voiced mirror sighed,</line>
      <line>I am all blurred with dust and damp,</line>
      <line>So long ago the clear day died,</line>
      <line>So long has gleamed nor fire nor lamp.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Whereon the curtain murmured back,</line>
      <line>Some change is on us, good or ill;</line>
      <line>Behind me and before is black</line>
      <line>As when those human things lie still:</line>
      <line>But I have seen the darkness grow</line>
      <line>As grows the daylight every morn;</line>
      <line>Have felt out there long shine and glow,</line>
      <line>In here long chilly dusk forlorn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The cupboard grumbled with a groan,</line>
      <line>Each new day worse starvation brings:</line>
      <line>Since he came here I have not known</line>
      <line>Or sweets or cates or wholesome things:</line>
      <line>But now! a pinch of meal, a crust,</line>
      <line>Throughout the week is all I get.</line>
      <line>I am so empty; it is just</line>
      <line>As when they said we were to let.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What is become, then, of our Man?</line>
      <line>The petulant old glass exclaimed;</line>
      <line>If all this time he slumber can,</line>
      <line>He really ought to be ashamed.</line>
      <line>I wish we had our Girl again,</line>
      <line>So gay and busy, bright and fair:</line>
      <line>The girls are better than these men,</line>
      <line>Who only for their dull selves care.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It is so many hours ago—</line>
      <line>The lamp and fire were both alight—</line>
      <line>I saw him pacing to and fro,</line>
      <line>Perturbing restlessly the night.</line>
      <line>His face was pale to give one fear,</line>
      <line>His eyes when lifted looked too bright;</line>
      <line>He muttered; what, I could not hear:</line>
      <line>Bad words though; something was not right.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The table said, He wrote so long</line>
      <line>That I grew weary of his weight;</line>
      <line>The pen kept up a cricket song,</line>
      <line>It ran and ran at such a rate:</line>
      <line>And in the longer pauses he</line>
      <line>With both his folded arms downpressed</line>
      <line>And stared as one who does not see,</line>
      <line>Or sank his head upon his breast.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The fire-grate said, I am as cold</line>
      <line>As if I never had a blaze;</line>
      <line>The few dead cinders here I hold,</line>
      <line>I held unburned for days and days.</line>
      <line>Last night he made them flare; but still</line>
      <line>What good did all his writing do?</line>
      <line>Among my ashes curl and thrill</line>
      <line>Thin ghosts of all those papers too.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The table answered, Not quite all;</line>
      <line>He saved and folded up one sheet,</line>
      <line>And sealed it fast, and let it fall;</line>
      <line>And here it lies now white and neat.</line>
      <line>Whereon the letter’s whisper came,</line>
      <line>My writing is closed up too well;</line>
      <line>Outside there’s not a single name,</line>
      <line>And who should read me I can’t tell.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The mirror sneered with scornful spite,</line>
      <line>(That ancient crack which spoiled her looks</line>
      <line>Had marred her temper), Write and write!</line>
      <line>And read those stupid, worn-out books!</line>
      <line>That’s all he does, read, write, and read,</line>
      <line>And smoke that nasty pipe which stinks:</line>
      <line>He never takes the slightest heed</line>
      <line>How any of us feels or thinks.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Lucy fifty times a day</line>
      <line>Would come and smile here in my face,</line>
      <line>Adjust a tress that curled astray,</line>
      <line>Or tie a ribbon with more grace:</line>
      <line>She looked so young and fresh and fair,</line>
      <line>She blushed with such a charming bloom,</line>
      <line>It did one good to see her there,</line>
      <line>And brightened all things in the room.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She did not sit hours stark and dumb</line>
      <line>As pale as moonshine by the lamp;</line>
      <line>To lie in bed when day was come,</line>
      <line>And leave us curtained chill and damp.</line>
      <line>She slept away the dreary dark,</line>
      <line>And rose to greet the pleasant morn;</line>
      <line>And sang as gaily as a lark</line>
      <line>While busy as the flies sun-born.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And how she loved us every one;</line>
      <line>And dusted this and mended that,</line>
      <line>With trills and laughs and freaks of fun,</line>
      <line>And tender scoldings in her chat!</line>
      <line>And then her bird, that sang as shrill</line>
      <line>As she sang sweet; her darling flowers</line>
      <line>That grew there in the window-sill,</line>
      <line>Where she would sit at work for hours.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It was not much she ever wrote;</line>
      <line>Her fingers had good work to do;</line>
      <line>Say, once a week a pretty note;</line>
      <line>And very long it took her too.</line>
      <line>And little more she read, I wis;</line>
      <line>Just now and then a pictured sheet,</line>
      <line>Besides those letters she would kiss</line>
      <line>And croon for hours, they were so sweet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She had her friends too, blithe young girls,</line>
      <line>Who whispered, babbled, laughed, caressed,</line>
      <line>And romped and danced with dancing curls,</line>
      <line>And gave our life a joyous zest.</line>
      <line>But with this dullard, glum and sour,</line>
      <line>Not one of all his fellow-men</line>
      <line>Has ever passed a social hour;</line>
      <line>We might be in some wild beast’s den.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>This long tirade aroused the bed,</line>
      <line>Who spoke in deep and ponderous bass,</line>
      <line>Befitting that calm life he led,</line>
      <line>As if firm-rooted in his place:</line>
      <line>In broad majestic bulk alone,</line>
      <line>As in thrice venerable age,</line>
      <line>He stood at once the royal throne,</line>
      <line>The monarch, the experienced sage:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I know what is and what has been;</line>
      <line>Not anything to me comes strange,</line>
      <line>Who in so many years have seen</line>
      <line>And lived through every kind of change.</line>
      <line>I know when men are good or bad,</line>
      <line>When well or ill, he slowly said;</line>
      <line>When sad or glad, when sane or mad,</line>
      <line>And when they sleep alive or dead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At this last word of solemn lore</line>
      <line>A tremor circled through the gloom,</line>
      <line>As if a crash upon the floor</line>
      <line>Had jarred and shaken all the room:</line>
      <line>For nearly all the listening things</line>
      <line>Were old and worn, and knew what curse</line>
      <line>Of violent change death often brings,</line>
      <line>From good to bad, from bad to worse;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They get to know each other well,</line>
      <line>To feel at home and settled down;</line>
      <line>Death bursts among them like a shell,</line>
      <line>And strews them over all the town.</line>
      <line>The bed went on, This man who lies</line>
      <line>Upon me now is stark and cold;</line>
      <line>He will not any more arise,</line>
      <line>And do the things he did of old.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But we shall have short peace or rest;</line>
      <line>For soon up here will come a rout,</line>
      <line>And nail him in a queer long chest,</line>
      <line>And carry him like luggage out.</line>
      <line>They will be muffled all in black,</line>
      <line>And whisper much, and sigh and weep:</line>
      <line>But he will never more come back,</line>
      <line>And some one else in me must sleep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thereon a little phial shrilled,</line>
      <line>Here empty on the chair I lie: 1</line>
      <line>I heard one say, as I was filled,</line>
      <line>With half of this a man would die.</line>
      <line>The man there drank me with slow breath,</line>
      <line>And murmured, Thus ends barren strife:</line>
      <line>O sweeter, thou cold wine of death,</line>
      <line>Than ever sweet warm wine of life.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One of my cousins long ago,</line>
      <line>A little thing, the mirror said,</line>
      <line>Was carried to a couch to show,</line>
      <line>Whether a man was really dead.</line>
      <line>Two great improvements marked the case:</line>
      <line>He did not blur her with his breath,</line>
      <line>His many-wrinkled, twitching face</line>
      <line>Was smooth old ivory: verdict, Death.—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It lay, the lowest thing there, lulled</line>
      <line>Sweet-sleep-like in corruption’s truce;</line>
      <line>The form whose purpose was annulled,</line>
      <line>While all the other shapes meant use.</line>
      <line>It lay, the he become now it,</line>
      <line>Unconscious of the deep disgrace,</line>
      <line>Unanxious how its parts might flit</line>
      <line>Through what new forms in time and space.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It lay and preached, as dumb things do,</line>
      <line>More powerfully than tongues can prate;</line>
      <line>Though life be torture through and through,</line>
      <line>Man is but weak to plain of fate:</line>
      <line>The drear path crawls on drearier still</line>
      <line>To wounded feet and hopeless breast?</line>
      <line>Well, he can lie down when he will,</line>
      <line>And straight all ends in endless rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And while the black night nothing saw,</line>
      <line>And till the cold morn came at last,</line>
      <line>That old bed held the room in awe</line>
      <line>With tales of its experience vast.</line>
      <line>It thrilled the gloom; it told such tales</line>
      <line>Of human sorrows and delights,</line>
      <line>Of fever moans and infant wails,</line>
      <line>Of births and deaths and bridal nights.</line>

    <title>from The City of Dreadful Night (I)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>He stood alone within the spacious square</line>
      <line>Declaiming from the central grassy mound,</line>
      <line>With head uncovered and with streaming hair,</line>
      <line>As if large multitudes were gathered round:</line>
      <line>A stalwart shape, the gestures full of might,</line>
      <line>The glances burning with unnatural light:—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: All was black,</line>
      <line>In heaven no single star, on earth no track;</line>
      <line>A brooding hush without a stir or note,</line>
      <line>The air so thick it clotted in my throat;</line>
      <line>And thus for hours; then some enormous things</line>
      <line>Swooped past with savage cries and clanking wings:</line>
      <line>But I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: Eyes of fire</line>
      <line>Glared at me throbbing with a starved desire;</line>
      <line>The hoarse and heavy and carnivorous breath</line>
      <line>Was hot upon me from deep jaws of death;</line>
      <line>Sharp claws, swift talons, fleshless fingers cold</line>
      <line>Plucked at me from the bushes, tried to hold:</line>
      <line>But I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: Lo you, there,</line>
      <line>That hillock burning with a brazen glare;</line>
      <line>Those myriad dusky flames with points a-glow</line>
      <line>Which writhed and hissed and darted to and fro;</line>
      <line>A Sabbath of the Serpents, heaped pell-mell</line>
      <line>For Devil’s roll-call and some fete of Hell:</line>
      <line>Yet I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: Meteors ran</line>
      <line>And crossed their javelins on the black sky-span;</line>
      <line>The zenith opened to a gulf of flame,</line>
      <line>The dreadful thunderbolts jarred earth’s fixed frame;</line>
      <line>The ground all heaved in waves of fire that surged</line>
      <line>And weltered round me sole there unsubmerged:</line>
      <line>Yet I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: Air once more,</line>
      <line>And I was close upon a wild sea-shore;</line>
      <line>Enormous cliffs arose on either hand,</line>
      <line>The deep tide thundered up a league-broad strand;</line>
      <line>White foambelts seethed there, wan spray swept and flew;</line>
      <line>The sky broke, moon and stars and clouds and blue:</line>
      <line>And I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: On the left</line>
      <line>The sun arose and crowned a broad crag-cleft;</line>
      <line>There stopped and burned out black, except a rim,</line>
      <line>A bleeding eyeless socket, red and dim;</line>
      <line>Whereon the moon fell suddenly south-west,</line>
      <line>And stood above the right-hand cliffs at rest:</line>
      <line>Still I strode on austere;</line>
      <line>No hope could have no fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: From the right</line>
      <line>A shape came slowly with a ruddy light;</line>
      <line>A woman with a red lamp in her hand,</line>
      <line>Bareheaded and barefooted on that strand;</line>
      <line>O desolation moving with such grace!</line>
      <line>O anguish with such beauty in thy face!</line>
      <line>I fell as on my bier,</line>
      <line>Hope travailed with such fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: I was twain,</line>
      <line>Two selves distinct that cannot join again;</line>
      <line>One stood apart and knew but could not stir,</line>
      <line>And watched the other stark in swoon and her;</line>
      <line>And she came on, and never turned aside,</line>
      <line>Between such sun and moon and roaring tide:</line>
      <line>And as she came more near</line>
      <line>My soul grew mad with fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: Hell is mild</line>
      <line>And piteous matched with that accursed wild;</line>
      <line>A large black sign was on her breast that bowed,</line>
      <line>A broad black band ran down her snow-white shroud;</line>
      <line>That lamp she held was her own burning heart,</line>
      <line>Whose blood-drops trickled step by step apart:</line>
      <line>The mystery was clear;</line>
      <line>Mad rage had swallowed fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: By the sea</line>
      <line>She knelt and bent above that senseless me;</line>
      <line>Those lamp-drops fell upon my white brow there,</line>
      <line>She tried to cleanse them with her tears and hair;</line>
      <line>She murmured words of pity, love, and woe,</line>
      <line>She heeded not the level rushing flow:</line>
      <line>And mad with rage and fear,</line>
      <line>I stood stonebound so near.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I came through the desert thus it was,</line>
      <line>As I came through the desert: When the tide</line>
      <line>Swept up to her there kneeling by my side,</line>
      <line>She clasped that corpse-like me, and they were borne</line>
      <line>Away, and this vile me was left forlorn;</line>
      <line>I know the whole sea cannot quench that heart,</line>
      <line>Or cleanse that brow, or wash those two apart:</line>
      <line>They love; their doom is drear,</line>
      <line>Yet they nor hope nor fear;</line>
      <line>But I, what do I here?</line>

    <title>from The City of Dreadful Night (II)</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I wandered in a suburb of the north,</line>
      <line>And reached a spot whence three close lanes led down,</line>
      <line>Beneath thick trees and hedgerows winding forth</line>
      <line>Like deep brook channels, deep and dark and lown:</line>
      <line>The air above was wan with misty light,</line>
      <line>The dull grey south showed one vague blur of white.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I took the left-hand lane and slowly trod</line>
      <line>Its earthen footpath, brushing as I went</line>
      <line>The humid leafage; and my feet were shod</line>
      <line>With heavy languor, and my frame downbent,</line>
      <line>With infinite sleepless weariness outworn,</line>
      <line>So many nights I thus had paced forlorn.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>After a hundred steps I grew aware</line>
      <line>Of something crawling in the lane below;</line>
      <line>It seemed a wounded creature prostrate there</line>
      <line>That sobbed with pangs in making progress slow,</line>
      <line>The hind limbs stretched to push, the fore limbs then</line>
      <line>To drag; for it would die in its own den.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But coming level with it I discerned</line>
      <line>That it had been a man; for at my tread</line>
      <line>It stopped in its sore travail and half-turned,</line>
      <line>Leaning upon its right, and raised its head,</line>
      <line>And with the left hand twitched back as in ire</line>
      <line>Long grey unreverend locks befouled with mire.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A haggard filthy face with bloodshot eyes,</line>
      <line>An infamy for manhood to behold.</line>
      <line>He gasped all trembling, What, you want my prize?</line>
      <line>You leave, to rob me, wine and lust and gold</line>
      <line>And all that men go mad upon, since you</line>
      <line>Have traced my sacred secret of the clue?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You think that I am weak and must submit;</line>
      <line>Yet I but scratch you with this poisoned blade,</line>
      <line>And you are dead as if I clove with it</line>
      <line>That false fierce greedy heart. Betrayed! betrayed!</line>
      <line>I fling this phial if you seek to pass,</line>
      <line>And you are forthwith shrivelled up like grass.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And then with sudden change, Take thought! take thought!</line>
      <line>Have pity on me! it is mine alone.</line>
      <line>If you could find, it would avail you naught;</line>
      <line>Seek elsewhere on the pathway of your own:</line>
      <line>For who of mortal or immortal race</line>
      <line>The lifetrack of another can retrace?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Did you but know my agony and toil!</line>
      <line>Two lanes diverge up yonder from this lane;</line>
      <line>My thin blood marks the long length of their soil;</line>
      <line>Such clue I left, who sought my clue in vain:</line>
      <line>My hands and knees are worn both flesh and bone;</line>
      <line>I cannot move but with continual moan.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But I am in the very way at last</line>
      <line>To find the long-lost broken golden thread</line>
      <line>Which reunites my present with my past,</line>
      <line>If you but go your own way. And I said,</line>
      <line>I will retire as soon as you have told</line>
      <line>Whereunto leadeth this lost thread of gold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And so you know it not! he hissed with scorn;</line>
      <line>I feared you, imbecile! It leads me back</line>
      <line>From this accursed night without a morn,</line>
      <line>And through the deserts which have else no track,</line>
      <line>And through vast wastes of horror-haunted time,</line>
      <line>To Eden innocence in Eden’s clime:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I become a nursling soft and pure,</line>
      <line>An infant cradled on its mother’s knee,</line>
      <line>Without a past, love-cherished and secure;</line>
      <line>Which if it saw this loathsome present Me,</line>
      <line>Would plunge its face into the pillowing breast,</line>
      <line>And scream abhorrence hard to lull to rest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He turned to grope; and I retiring brushed</line>
      <line>Thin shreds of gossamer from off my face,</line>
      <line>And mused, His life would grow, the germ uncrushed;</line>
      <line>He should to antenatal night retrace,</line>
      <line>And hide his elements in that large womb</line>
      <line>Beyond the reach of man-evolving Doom.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And even thus, what weary way were planned,</line>
      <line>To seek oblivion through the far-off gate</line>
      <line>Of birth, when that of death is close at hand!</line>
      <line>For this is law, if law there be in Fate:</line>
      <line>What never has been, yet may have its when;</line>
      <line>The thing which has been, never is again.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Not a line of her writing have I,</line>
      <line>Not a thread of her hair,</line>
      <line>No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby</line>
      <line>I may picture her there;</line>
      <line>And in vain do I urge my unsight</line>
      <line>To conceive my lost prize</line>
      <line>At her close, whom I knew when her dreams were upbrimming</line>
      <line>with light,</line>
      <line>And with laughter her eyes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What scenes spread around her last days,</line>
      <line>Sad, shining, or dim?</line>
      <line>Did her gifts and compassions enray and enarch her sweet ways</line>
      <line>With an aureate nimb?</line>
      <line>Or did life-light decline from her years,</line>
      <line>And mischances control</line>
      <line>Her full day-star; unease, or regret, or forebodings, or fears</line>
      <line>Disennoble her soul?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thus I do but the phantom retain</line>
      <line>Of the maiden of yore</line>
      <line>As my relic; yet haply the best of her—fined in my brain</line>
      <line>It may be the more</line>
      <line>That no line of her writing have I,</line>
      <line>Nor a thread of her hair,</line>
      <line>No mark of her late time as dame in her dwelling, whereby</line>
      <line>I may picture her there.</line>

      <line>And, Lizbie Browne,</line>
      <line>Who else had hair</line>
      <line>Bay-red as yours,</line>

      <line>Bred out of doors,</line>
      <line>Sweet Lizbie Browne?</line>

      <line>When, Lizbie Browne,</line>

      <line>You disappeared,</line>

      <line>Ay, Lizbie Browne,</line>
      <line>So swift your life,</line>
      <line>And mine so slow,</line>
      <line>You were a wife</line>

      <line>Love, Lizbie Browne.</line>

      <line>Where went you then,</line>
      <line>O Lizbie Browne?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dear Lizbie Browne,</line>
      <line>I should have thought,</line>
      <line>‘Girls ripen fast,’</line>
      <line>And coaxed and caught</line>
      <line>You ere you passed,</line>
      <line>Dear Lizbie Browne!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, Lizbie Browne,</line>
      <line>I let you slip;</line>
      <line>Shaped not a sign;</line>
      <line>Touched never your lip</line>
      <line>With lip of mine,</line>
      <line>Lost Lizbie Browne!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, Lizbie Browne,</line>
      <line>When on a day</line>
      <line>Men speak of me</line>
      <line>As not, you’ll say,</line>
      <line>‘And who was he?’—</line>
      <line>Yes, Lizbie Browne!</line>

      <line>Why should I heed their railings? What’s a prude?</line>
      <line>A devil’s scarecrow in the fields of good.</line>
      <line>Let them rail on. I think a wedding-day</line>
      <line>Looks best, as mountains do, some miles away,</line>
      <line>Or squalid fishing-smacks far out to sea,</line>
      <line>Seen lily-sailed in sunshine and blue haze,</line>
      <line>Where the delicious lights are all men chase,</line>
      <line>And no man ever reaches. And so I’m free</line>
      <line>Another six weeks—move in a rich half-light,</line>
      <line>A tenderest compromise of dark and bright,</line>
      <line>A magic season, in short, when eyes that shine</line>
      <line>And lips that whisper with soft words, combine</line>
      <line>The spice of wrong, the conscience-ease of right,</line>
      <line>And deepest sighs come most luxuriously.</line>
      <line>Then too this twilight-time leads not to night</line>
      <line>But sunrise—that at least will gladden me,</line>
      <line>The sunrise of my day of married life,</line>
      <line>Ere bride and bridegroom fade to man and wife:</line>
      <line>And I meanwhile, a short time more, am free—</line>
      <line>Or half free; wherefore let me love my fill</line>
      <line>Of half-loves, ere I consecrate my days,</line>
      <line>In sober, sombre truth, for good and ill,</line>
      <line>To the one worship of a withering face.</line>

    <title>Christmas Thoughts, by a Modern Thinker</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The windows of the church are bright;</line>
      <line>’Tis Christmas Eve; a low wind breathes;</line>
      <line>And girls with happy eyes to-night</line>
      <line>Are hanging up the Christmas wreaths;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And village voices by-and-by</line>
      <line>Will reach my windows through the trees,</line>
      <line>With wild, sweet music: ‘Praise on high</line>
      <line>To God: on earth, good-will and peace.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Oh, happy girls, that hang the wreaths!</line>
      <line>Oh, village fiddlers, happy ye!</line>
      <line>Christmas to you still truly breathes</line>
      <line>Good-will and peace; but not to me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yes, gladness is your simple role,</line>
      <line>Ye foolish girls, ye labouring poor;</line>
      <line>But joy would ill beseem my soul—</line>
      <line>To sigh, my part is, and endure.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For once as Rousseau stood, I stand</line>
      <line>Apart, made picturesque by grief—</line>
      <line>One of a small world-weary band,</line>
      <line>The orphans of a dead belief.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Through graveyards lone we love to stray,</line>
      <line>And sadly the sad tombs explore,</line>
      <line>And contradict the texts which say</line>
      <line>That we shall rise once more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Our faith is dead, of course; and grief</line>
      <line>Fills its room up; and Christmas pie</line>
      <line>And turkey cannot bring relief</line>
      <line>To such as Obermann and I.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, Obermann, and might I pass</line>
      <line>This English Christmas-tide with thee,</line>
      <line>Far by those inland waves whose glass</line>
      <line>Brightens and breaks by Meillerie;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or else amongst the sternest dells</line>
      <line>Alp shags with pine, we’d mix our sighs,</line>
      <line>Mourn at the sound of Christmas bells,</line>
      <line>Sniff at the smell of Christmas pies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But thou art dead; and long, dank grass</line>
      <line>And wet mould cool thy tired, hot brain;</line>
      <line>Thou art lain down, and now, alas!</line>
      <line>Of course you won’t get up again.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet, Obermann, ’tis better so;</line>
      <line>For if, sad slumberer, after all</line>
      <line>You were to re-arise, you know</line>
      <line>’Twould make us feel so very small.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Best bear our grief this manlier way,</line>
      <line>And make our grief be balm to grief;</line>
      <line>For if in faith sweet comfort lay,</line>
      <line>There lurks sweet pride in unbelief.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Wherefore, remembering this, once more</line>
      <line>Unto my childhood’s church I’ll go,</line>
      <line>And bow my head at that low door</line>
      <line>I passed through standing, long ago.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’ll sit in the accustomed place,</line>
      <line>And make, while all the unlearned stare,</line>
      <line>A mournful, atheistic face</line>
      <line>At their vain noise of unheard prayer.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then, while they hymn the heavenly birth</line>
      <line>And angel voices from the skies,</line>
      <line>My thoughts shall go where Weimar’s earth</line>
      <line>For ever darkens Goethe’s eyes;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till sweet girls’ glances from their books</line>
      <line>Shall steal towards me, and they sigh:</line>
      <line>‘How intellectual he looks,</line>
      <line>And yet how wistful! And his eye</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Has that vain look of baffled prayer!’</line>
      <line>And then when church is o’er I’ll run,</line>
      <line>Comb misery into all my hair,</line>
      <line>And go and get my portrait done.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Our brown canal was endless to my thought;</line>
      <line>And on its banks I sat in dreamy peace,</line>
      <line>Unknowing how the good I loved was wrought,</line>
      <line>Untroubled by the fear that it would cease.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Slowly the barges floated into hew</line>
      <line>Rounding a grassy hill to me sublime</line>
      <line>With some Unknown beyond it, whither flew</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>from Brother and Sister (VII)</line>
      <line>Those long days measured by my little feet</line>
      <line>Had chronicles which yield me many a text;</line>
      <line>Where irony still finds an image meet</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>One day my brother left me in high charge,</line>
      <line>To mind the rod, while he went seeking bait,</line>
      <line>And bade me, when I saw a nearing barge,</line>
      <line>Snatch out the line, lest he should come too late.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Proud of the task, I watched with all my might</line>
      <line>For one whole minute, till my eyes grew wide,</line>
      <line>Till sky and earth took on a strange new light</line>
      <line>And seemed a dream-world floating on some tide—</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>A fair pavilioned boat for me alone</line>
      <line>Bearing me onward through the vast unknown.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>from Brother and Sister (VIII)</line>
      <line>But sudden came the barge’s pitch-black prow,</line>
      <line>Nearer and angrier came my brother’s cry,</line>
      <line>And all my soul was quivering fear, when lo!</line>
      <line>Upon the imperilled line, suspended high,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A silver perch! My guilt that won the prey,</line>
      <line>Now turned to merit, had a guerdon rich</line>
      <line>Of hugs and praises, and made merry play,</line>
      <line>Until my triumph reached its highest pitch</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When all at home were told the wondrous feat,</line>
      <line>And how the little sister had fished well.</line>
      <line>In secret, though my fortune tasted sweet,</line>
      <line>I wondered why this happiness befell.</line>

      <line>Then—‘Damn!’</line>
      <line>He said—and ‘Devil!—</line>
      <line>I thought’—but what he thought who knows?</line>
      <line>One plunge, and off he goes</line>
      <line>East? North?</line>
      <line>Fares forth</line>
      <line>To Lundy? Cardiff? But of that keen probe</line>
      <line>That for an instant pierced the lobe</line>
      <line>Of his sad brain,</line>
      <line>Tickling the phosphor-grit,</line>
      <line>How long will he retain</line>
      <line>One bit?</line>
      <line>And then above</line>
      <line>My little daughter kneels, and says her prayers.</line>
      <line>Quite right!</line>
      <line>My little love—</line>
      <line>Good night!</line>
      <line>Sweet pet!</line>
      <line>Put out the light!</line>
      <line>And so</line>
      <line>I go</line>
      <line>Downstairs—</line>
      <line>And yet—and yet—</line>
      <line>That cod!</line>
      <line>O God!</line>

      <line>I bended unto me a bough of May,</line>
      <line>That I might see and smell:</line>
      <line>It bore it in a sort of way,</line>
      <line>It bore it very well.</line>
      <line>But, when I let it backward sway,</line>

      <line>With what a toss, with what a swing,</line>
      <line>The dainty thing</line>
      <line>Resumed its proper level,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>O Englishwoman on the Pincian,</line>
      <line>I love you not, nor ever can—</line>
      <line>Astounding woman on the Pincian!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I know your mechanism well-adjusted,</line>
      <line>I see your mind and body have been trusted</line>
      <line>To all the proper people:</line>
      <line>I see you straight as is a steeple;</line>
      <line>I see you are not old;</line>
      <line>I see you are a rich man’s daughter;</line>
      <line>I see you know the use of gold,</line>
      <line>But also know the use of soap-and-water;</line>
      <line>And yet I love you not, nor ever can—</line>
      <line>Distinguished woman on the Pincian!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You have no doubt of your preeminence,</line>
      <line>Nor do I make pretence</line>
      <line>To challenge it for my poor little slattern,</line>
      <line>Whose costume dates from Saturn—</line>
      <line>My wall-flower with the long, love-draggled fringes</line>
      <line>But then the controversy hinges</line>
      <line>On higher forms; and you must bear</line>
      <line>Comparisons more noble. Stare, yes, stare—</line>
      <line>I love you not, nor ever can,</line>
      <line>You peerless woman on the Pincian.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No, you’ll not see her on the Pincian,</line>
      <line>My Roman woman, wife of Roman man!</line>
      <line>Elsewhere you may—</line>
      <line>And she is bright as is the day;</line>
      <line>And she is sweet, that honest workman’s wife</line>
      <line>Fulfilled with bounteous life:</line>
      <line>Her body balanced like a spring</line>
      <line>In equipoise of perfect natural grace;</line>
      <line>Her soul unquestioning</line>
      <line>Of ought but genial cares; her face,</line>
      <line>Her frock, her attitude, her pace</line>
      <line>The confluence of absolute harmonies—</line>
      <line>And you, my Lady Margaret,</line>
      <line>Pray what have you to set</line>
      <line>’Gainst splendours such as these?</line>
      <line>No, I don’t love you, and I never can,</line>
      <line>Pretentious woman on the Pincian!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But morals—beautiful serenity</line>
      <line>Of social life, the sugar and the tea,</line>
      <line>The flannels and the soup, the coals,</line>
      <line>The patent recipes for saving souls,</line>
      <line>And other things: the chill dead sneer</line>
      <line>Conventional, the abject fear</line>
      <line>Of form-transgressing freedom—I admit</line>
      <line>That you have these; but love you not a whit</line>
      <line>The more, nor ever can,</line>
      <line>Alarming female on the Pincian!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Come out, O woman, from this blindness!</line>
      <line>Rome, too, has women full of loving-kindness,</line>
      <line>Has noble women, perfect in all good</line>
      <line>That makes the glory of great womanhood—</line>
      <line>But they are Women! I have seen them bent</line>
      <line>On gracious errand; seen how goodness lent</line>
      <line>The grave, ineffable charm</line>
      <line>That guards from possibility of harm</line>
      <line>A creature so divinely made,</line>
      <line>So softly swayed</line>
      <line>With native gesture free—</line>
      <line>The melting-point of passionate purity.</line>
      <line>Yes—soup and flannels too,</line>
      <line>And tickets for them—just like you—</line>
      <line>Tracts, books, and all the innumerable channels</line>
      <line>Through which your bounty acts—</line>
      <line>Well—not the tracts,</line>
      <line>But certainly the flannels—</line>
      <line>Her I must love, but you I never can,</line>
      <line>Unlovely woman on the Pincian.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And yet—</line>
      <line>Remarkable woman on the Pincian!—</line>
      <line>We owe a sort of debt</line>
      <line>To you, as having gone with us of old</line>
      <line>To those bleak islands, cold</line>
      <line>And desolate and grim,</line>
      <line>Upon the Ocean’s rim,</line>
      <line>And shared their horrors with us—not that then</line>
      <line>Our poor bewildered ken</line>
      <line>Could catch the further issues, knowing only</line>
      <line>That we were very lonely!</line>
      <line>Ah well, you did us service in your station;</line>
      <line>And how the progress of our civilisation</line>
      <line>Has made you quite so terrible</line>
      <line>It boots not ask; for still</line>
      <line>You gave us stalwart scions,</line>
      <line>Suckled the young sea-lions,</line>
      <line>And smiled infrequent, glacial smiles</line>
      <line>Upon the sulky isles—</line>
      <line>For this and all His mercies—stay at home!</line>
      <line>Here are the passion-flowers!</line>
      <line>Here are the sunny hours!</line>
      <line>O Pincian woman, do not come to Rome!</line>

      <line>Go on! Go on!</line>
      <line>Don’t wait for me!</line>
      <line>Isaac was Abraham’s son—</line>
      <line>Yes, certainly—</line>
      <line>And as they clomb Moriah—</line>
      <line>I know! I know!</line>
      <line>A type of the Messiah—</line>
      <line>Just so! just so!</line>
      <line>Perfectly right; and then the ram</line>
      <line>Caught in the—listening? Why of course I am!</line>
      <line>Wherefore, my brethren, that was counted—yes—</line>
      <line>To Abraham for righteousness—</line>
      <line>Exactly, so I said—</line>
      <line>At least—but go a-head!</line>
      <line>Now mark</line>
      <line>The conduct of the Patriarch—</line>
      <line>‘Behold the wood!’</line>
      <line>Isaac exclaimed—By Jove, an Oxford hood!</line>
      <line>'Bui where’—</line>
      <line>What long straight hair!</line>
      <line>1 Where is the lamb?’</line>
      <line>You mean—the ram:</line>
      <line>No, no! I beg your pardon!</line>
      <line>There’s the Churchwarden,</line>
      <line>In the Clerk’s pew—</line>
      <line>Stick tipped with blue—</line>
      <line>Now Justification—</line>
      <line>‘By Faith?’ I fancy; Aye, the old equation;</line>
      <line>Go it, Justice! Go it, Mercy!</line>
      <line>Go it, Douglas! Go it, Percy!</line>
      <line>I back the winner,</line>
      <line>And have a vague conception of the sinner—</line>
      <line>Limbs nude,</line>
      <line>Horatian attitude,</line>
      <line>Nursing his foot in Sublapsarian mood—</line>
      <line>More power</line>
      <line>To you my friend! you’re good for half-an-hour.</line>
      <line>Dry bones! dry bones!</line>
      <line>But in my ear the long-drawn west wind moans,</line>
      <line>Sweet voices seem to murmur from the wave;</line>
      <line>And I can sit, and look upon the stones</line>

    <title>Dartmoor: Sunset at Chagford</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is it ironical, a fool enigma,</line>
      <line>This sunset show?</line>
      <line>The purple stigma,</line>
      <line>Black mountain cut upon a saffron glow—</line>
      <line>Is it a mammoth joke,</line>
      <line>A riddle put for me to guess,</line>
      <line>Which having duly honoured, I may smoke,</line>
      <line>And go to bed,</line>
      <line>And snore,</line>
      <line>Having a soothing consciousness</line>
      <line>Of something red?</line>
      <line>Or is it more?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah, is it, is it more?</line>
      <line>A dole, perhaps?</line>
      <line>The scraps</line>
      <line>Tossed from the table of the revelling gods?—</line>
      <line>What odds!</line>
      <line>I taste them—Lazarus</line>
      <line>Was nourished thus!</line>
      <line>But, all the same, it surely is a cheat—</line>
      <line>Is this the stuff they eat?</line>
      <line>A cheat! a cheat!</line>
      <line>Then let the garbage be—</line>
      <line>Some pig-wash! let it vanish down the sink</line>
      <line>Of night! ’tis not for me.</line>
      <line>I will not drink</line>
      <line>Their draff,</line>
      <line>While, throned on high, they quaff</line>
      <line>The fragrant sconce—</line>
      <line>Has Heaven no cloaca for the nonce?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Say ’tis an anodyne—</line>
      <line>It never shall be mine.</line>
      <line>I want no opiates—</line>
      <line>The best of all their cates</line>
      <line>Were gross to balk the meanest sense;</line>
      <line>I want to be co-equal with their fates;</line>
      <line>I will not be put off with temporal pretence:</line>
      <line>I want to be awake, and know, not stand</line>
      <line>And stare at waving of a conjuror’s hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But is it speech</line>
      <line>Wherewith they strive to reach</line>
      <line>Our poor inadequate souls?</line>
      <line>The round earth rolls;</line>
      <line>I cannot hear it hum—</line>
      <line>The stars are dumb—</line>
      <line>The voices of the world are in my ear</line>
      <line>A sensuous murmur. Nothing speaks</line>
      <line>But man, my fellow—him I hear,</line>
      <line>And understand; but beasts and birds</line>
      <line>And winds and waves are destitute of words.</line>
      <line>What is the alphabet</line>
      <line>The gods have set?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>What babbling! what delusion!</line>
      <line>And in these sunset tints</line>
      <line>What gay confusion!</line>
      <line>Man prints</line>
      <line>His meaning, has a letter</line>
      <line>Determinate. I know that it is better</line>
      <line>Than all this cumbrous hieroglyph—</line>
      <line>The For, the If</line>
      <line>Are growth of man’s analysis:</line>
      <line>The gods in bliss</line>
      <line>Scrabble a baby-jargon on the skies</line>
      <line>For us to analyse!</line>
      <line>Cumbrous? nay, idiotic—</line>
      <line>A party-coloured symbolism,</line>
      <line>The fragments of a shivered prism:</line>
      <line>Man gives the swift demotic.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis good to see</line>
      <line>The economy</line>
      <line>Of poor upstriving man!</line>
      <line>Since time began,</line>
      <line>He has been sifting</line>
      <line>The elements; while God, on chaos drifting,</line>
      <line>Sows broadcast all His stuff.</line>
      <line>Lavish enough,</line>
      <line>No doubt; but why this waste?</line>
      <line>See! of these very sunset dyes</line>
      <line>The virgin chaste</line>
      <line>Takes one, and in a harlot’s eyes</line>
      <line>Another rots. They go by billion billions:</line>
      <line>Each blade of grass</line>
      <line>Ignores them as they pass;</line>
      <line>The spiders in their foul pavilions,</line>
      <line>Behold this vulgar gear,</line>
      <line>And sneer;</line>
      <line>Dull frogs</line>
      <line>In bogs</line>
      <line>Catch rosy gleams through rushes,</line>
      <line>And know that night is near;</line>
      <line>Wrong-headed thrushes</line>
      <line>Blow bugles to it;</line>
      <line>And a wrong-headed poet</line>
      <line>Will strut, and strain the cogs</line>
      <line>Of the machine, he blushes</line>
      <line>To call his Muse, and maunder;</line>
      <line>And, marvellous to relate!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>These pseudo-messengers of state</line>
      <line>Will wander</line>
      <line>Where there is no intelligence to meet them,</line>
      <line>Nor even a sensorium to greet them.</line>
      <line>The very finest of them</line>
      <line>Go where there’s nought to love them</line>
      <line>Or notice them: to cairns, to rocks</line>
      <line>Where ravens nurse their young,</line>
      <line>To mica-splints from granite-boulders wrung</line>
      <line>By channels of the marsh, to stocks</line>
      <line>Of old dead willows in a pool as dead.</line>
      <line>Can anything be said</line>
      <line>To these? The leech</line>
      <line>Looks from its muddy lair,</line>
      <line>And sees a silly something in the air—</line>
      <line>Call you this speech?</line>
      <line>O God, if it be speech,</line>
      <line>Speak plainer,</line>
      <line>If Thou would’st teach</line>
      <line>That I shall be a gainer!</line>
      <line>The age of picture-alphabets is gone:</line>
      <line>We are not now so weak;</line>
      <line>We are too old to con</line>
      <line>The horn-book of our youth. Time lags—</line>
      <line>O, rip this obsolete blazon into rags!</line>
      <line>And speak! O, speak!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But, if I be a spectacle</line>
      <line>In Thy great theatre, then do Thy will:</line>
      <line>Arrange Thy instruments with circumspection;</line>
      <line>Summon Thine angels to the vivisection!</line>
      <line>But quick! O, quick!</line>
      <line>For I am sick,</line>
      <line>And very sad.</line>
      <line>Thy pupils will be glad.</line>
      <line>‘See,’ Thou exclaim’st, ‘this ray!</line>
      <line>How permanent upon the retina!</line>
      <line>How odd that purple hue!</line>
      <line>The pineal gland is blue.</line>
      <line>I stick this probe</line>
      <line>In the posterior lobe—</line>
      <line>Behold the cerebellum</line>
      <line>A smoky yellow, like old vellum!</line>
      <line>Students will please observe</line>
      <line>The structure of the optic nerve.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>See! nothing could be finer—</line>
      <line>That film of pink</line>
      <line>Around the hippocampus minor.</line>
      <line>Behold!</line>
      <line>I touch it, and it turns bright gold.</line>
      <line>Again!—as black as ink.</line>
      <line>Another lancet—thanks!</line>
      <line>That’s Manx—</line>
      <line>Yes, the delicate pale sea-green</line>
      <line>Passing into ultra-marine—</line>
      <line>A little blurred—in fact</line>
      <line>This brain seems packed</line>
      <line>With sunsets. Bring</line>
      <line>That battery here; now put your</line>
      <line>Negative pole beneath the suture—</line>
      <line>That’s just the thing.</line>
      <line>Now then the other way—</line>
      <line>I say! I say!</line>
      <line>More chloroform!</line>
      <line>(A little more will do no harm)</line>
      <line>Now this is the most instructive of all</line>
      <line>The phenomena, what in fact we may call</line>
      <line>The most obvious justification</line>
      <line>Of vivisection in general.</line>
      <line>Observe (once! twice!</line>
      <line>That’s very nice)—</line>
      <line>Observe, I say, the incipient relation</line>
      <line>Of a quasi-moral activity</line>
      <line>To this physical agitation!</line>
      <line>Of course, you see....’</line>
      <line>Yes, yes, O God,</line>
      <line>I feel the prod</line>
      <line>Of that dissecting knife.</line>
      <line>Instructive, say the pupil angels, very:</line>
      <line>And some take notes, and some take sandwiches and sherry;</line>
      <line>And some are prying</line>
      <line>Into the very substance of my brain—</line>
      <line>I feel their fingers!</line>
      <line>(My life! my life!)</line>
      <line>Yes, yes! it lingers!</line>
      <line>The sun, the sun—</line>
      <line>Go on! go on!</line>

      <line>Nobody knows the world but me.</line>
      <line>The rest go to bed; I sit up and see.</line>
      <line>I’m a better observer than any of you all,</line>
      <line>For I never look out till the twilight fall,</line>
      <line>And never then without green glasses,</line>
      <line>And that is how my wisdom passes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I never think, for that is not fit:</line>
      <line>I observe. I have seen the white moon sit</line>
      <line>On her nest, the sea, like a fluffy owl,</line>
      <line>Hatching the boats and the long-legged fowl!</line>
      <line>When the oysters gape—you may make a note-</line>
      <line>She drops a pearl into every throat.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I can see the wind: can you do that?</line>
      <line>I see the dreams he has in his hat,</line>
      <line>I see him shaking them out as he goes,</line>
      <line>I see them rush in at man’s snoring nose.</line>
      <line>Ten thousand things you could not think,</line>
      <line>I can write down plain with pen and ink!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You know that I know; therefore pull off your hat,</line>
      <line>Whether round and tall, or square and flat:</line>
      <line>You cannot do better than trust in me;</line>
      <line>You may shut your eyes in fact—/ see!</line>
      <line>Lifelong I will lead you, and then, like the owl,</line>
      <line>I will bury you nicely with my spade and showl.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>There is a river</line>
      <line>whose waters run asleep</line>
      <line>run run ever</line>
      <line>singing in the shallows</line>
      <line>dumb in the hollows</line>
      <line>sleeping so deep</line>
      <line>and all the swallows</line>
      <line>that dip their feathers</line>
      <line>in the hollows</line>
      <line>or in the shallows</line>
      <line>are the merriest swallows</line>
      <line>and the nests they make</line>
      <line>with the clay they cake</line>
      <line>with the water they shake</line>
      <line>from their wings that rake</line>
      <line>the water out of the shallows</line>
      <line>or out of the hollows</line>
      <line>will hold together</line>
      <line>in any weather</line>
      <line>and the swallows</line>
      <line>are the merriest fellows</line>
      <line>and have the merriest children</line>
      <line>and are built very narrow</line>
      <line>like the head of an arrow</line>
      <line>to cut the air</line>
      <line>and go just where</line>
      <line>the nicest water is flowing</line>
      <line>and the nicest dust is blowing</line>
      <line>and each so narrow</line>
      <line>like the head of an arrow</line>
      <line>is a wonderful barrow</line>
      <line>to carry the mud he makes</line>
      <line>for his children’s sakes</line>
      <line>from the wet water flowing</line>
      <line>and the dry dust blowing</line>
      <line>to build his nest</line>
      <line>for her he loves best</line>
      <line>and the wind cakes it</line>
      <line>the sun bakes it</line>
      <line>into a nest</line>
      <line>for the rest</line>
      <line>of her he loves best</line>
      <line>and all their merry children</line>
      <line>each little fellow</line>
      <line>with a beak as yellow</line>
      <line>as the buttercups growing</line>
      <line>beside the flowing</line>
      <line>of the singing river</line>
      <line>always and ever</line>
      <line>growing and blowing</line>
      <line>as fast as the sheep</line>
      <line>awake or asleep</line>
      <line>crop them and crop</line>
      <line>and cannot stop</line>
      <line>their yellowness blowing</line>
      <line>nor yet the growing</line>
      <line>of the obstinate daisies</line>
      <line>the little white praises</line>
      <line>they grow and they blow</line>
      <line>they spread out their crown</line>
      <line>and they praise the sun</line>
      <line>and when he goes down</line>
      <line>their praising is done</line>
      <line>they fold up their crown</line>
      <line>and sleep every one</line>
      <line>till over the plain</line>
      <line>he is shining amain</line>
      <line>and they’re at it again</line>
      <line>praising and praising</line>
      <line>such low songs raising</line>
      <line>that no one can hear them</line>
      <line>but the sun so near them</line>
      <line>and the sheep that bite them</line>
      <line>but do not fright them</line>
      <line>are the quietest sheep</line>
      <line>awake or asleep</line>
      <line>with the merriest bleat</line>
      <line>and the little lambs</line>
      <line>are the merriest lambs</line>
      <line>forgetting to eat</line>
      <line>for the frolic in their feet</line>
      <line>and the lambs and their dams</line>
      <line>are the whitest sheep</line>
      <line>with the woolliest wool</line>
      <line>for the swallow to pull</line>
      <line>when he makes his nest</line>
      <line>for her he loves best</line>
      <line>and they shine like snow</line>
      <line>in the grasses that grow</line>
      <line>by the singing river</line>
      <line>that sings for ever</line>
      <line>and the sheep and the lambs</line>
      <line>are merry for ever</line>
      <line>because the river</line>
      <line>sings and they drink it</line>
      <line>and the lambs and their dams</line>
      <line>would any one think it</line>
      <line>are bright and white</line>
      <line>because of their diet</line>
      <line>which gladdens them quiet</line>
      <line>for what they bite</line>
      <line>is buttercups yellow</line>
      <line>and daisies white</line>
      <line>and grass as green</line>
      <line>as the river can make it</line>
      <line>with wind as mellow</line>
      <line>to kiss it and shake it</line>
      <line>as never was known</line>
      <line>but here in the hollows</line>
      <line>beside the river</line>
      <line>where all the swallows</line>
      <line>are the merriest fellows</line>
      <line>and the nests they make</line>
      <line>with the clay they cake</line>
      <line>in the sunshine bake</line>
      <line>till they are like bone</line>
      <line>and as dry in the wind</line>
      <line>as a marble stone</line>
      <line>dried in the wind</line>
      <line>the sweetest wind</line>
      <line>that blows by the river</line>
      <line>flowing for ever</line>
      <line>and who shall find</line>
      <line>whence comes the wind</line>
      <line>that blows on the hollows</line>
      <line>and over the shallows</line>
      <line>where dip the swallows</line>
      <line>and comes and goes</line>
      <line>and the sweet life blows</line>
      <line>into the river</line>
      <line>that sings as it flows</line>
      <line>and the sweet life blows</line>
      <line>into the sheep</line>
      <line>awake or asleep</line>
      <line>with the woolliest wool</line>
      <line>and the trailingest tails</line>
      <line>and never fails</line>
      <line>gentle and cool</line>
      <line>to wave the wool</line>
      <line>and to toss the grass</line>
      <line>as the lambs and the sheep</line>
      <line>over it pass</line>
      <line>and tug and bite</line>
      <line>with their teeth so white</line>
      <line>and then with the sweep</line>
      <line>of their trailing tails</line>
      <line>smooth it again</line>
      <line>and it grows amain</line>
      <line>and amain it grows</line>
      <line>and the wind that blows</line>
      <line>tosses the swallows</line>
      <line>over the hollows</line>
      <line>and over the shallows</line>
      <line>and blows the sweet life</line>
      <line>and the joy so rife</line>
      <line>into the swallows</line>
      <line>that skim the shallows</line>
      <line>and have the yellowest children</line>
      <line>and the wind that blows</line>
      <line>is the life of the river</line>
      <line>that flows for ever</line>
      <line>and washes the grasses</line>
      <line>still as it passes</line>
      <line>and feeds the daisies</line>
      <line>the little white praises</line>
      <line>and buttercups sunny</line>
      <line>with butter and honey</line>
      <line>that whiten the sheep</line>
      <line>awake or asleep</line>
      <line>that nibble and bite</line>
      <line>and grow whiter than white</line>
      <line>and merry and quiet</line>
      <line>on such good diet</line>
      <line>watered by the river</line>
      <line>and tossed for ever</line>
      <line>by the wind that tosses</line>
      <line>the wool and the grasses</line>
      <line>and the swallow that crosses</line>
      <line>with all the swallows</line>
      <line>over the shallows</line>
      <line>dipping their wings</line>
      <line>to gather the water</line>
      <line>and bake the cake</line>
      <line>for the wind to make</line>
      <line>as hard as a bone</line>
      <line>and as dry as a stone</line>
      <line>and who shall find</line>
      <line>whence comes the wind</line>
      <line>that blows from behind</line>
      <line>and ripples the river j</line>
      <line>that flows for ever</line>
      <line>and still as it passes</line>
      <line>waves the grasses</line>
      <line>and cools the daisies</line>
      <line>the white sun-praises</line>
      <line>that feed the sheep</line>
      <line>awake or asleep</line>
      <line>and give them their wool</line>
      <line>for the swallows to pull</line>
      <line>a little away</line>
      <line>to mix with the clay</line>
      <line>that cakes to a nest</line>
      <line>for those they love best</line>
      <line>and all the yellow children</line>
      <line>soon to go trying</line>
      <line>their wings at the flying</line>
      <line>over the hollows</line>
      <line>and over the shallows</line>
      <line>with all the swallows</line>
      <line>that do not know</line>
      <line>whence the wind doth blow</line>
      <line>that comes from behind</line>
      <line>a blowing wind</line>

      <line>Thou strainest through the mountain fern,</line>
      <line>A most exiguously thin</line>
      <line>Burn.</line>
      <line>For all thy foam, for all thy din,</line>
      <line>Thee shall the pallid lake inurn,</line>
      <line>With well-a-day for Mr Swin-</line>
      <line>Burne!</line>
      <line>Take then this quarto in thy fin</line>
      <line>And, O thou stoker huge and stern,</line>
      <line>The whole affair, outside and in,</line>
      <line>Burn!</line>
      <line>But save the true poetic kin,</line>
      <line>The works of Mr Robert Burn!</line>
      <line>And William Wordsworth upon Tin-</line>

      <line>So live, so love, so use that fragile hour,</line>

      <line>The poor survivor may not weep and wake.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Even in the bluest noonday of July,</line>
      <line>There could not run the smallest breath of wind</line>
      <line>But all the quarter sounded like a wood;</line>
      <line>And in the chequered silence and above</line>
      <line>The hum of city cabs that sought the Bois,</line>
      <line>Suburban ashes shivered into song.</line>
      <line>A patter and a chatter and a chirp</line>
      <line>And a long dying hiss—it was as though</line>
      <line>Starched old brocaded dames through all the house</line>
      <line>Had trailed a strident skirt, or the whole sky</line>
      <line>Even in a wink had over-brimmed in rain.</line>
      <line>Hark, in these shady parlours, how it talks</line>
      <line>Of the near Autumn, how the smitten ash</line>
      <line>Trembles and augurs floods! O not too long</line>
      <line>In these inconstant latitudes delay,</line>
      <line>O not too late from the unbeloved north</line>
      <line>Trim your escape! For soon shall this low roof</line>
      <line>Resound indeed with rain, soon shall your eyes</line>
      <line>Search the foul garden, search the darkened rooms,</line>
      <line>Nor find one jewel but the blazing log.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>MY house, I say. But hark to the sunny doves</line>
      <line>That make my roof the arena of their loves,</line>
      <line>That gyre about the gable all day long</line>
      <line>And fill the chimneys with their murmurous song:</line>
      <line>Our house, they say; and mine, the cat declares</line>
      <line>And spreads his golden fleece upon the chairs;</line>
      <line>And mine the dog, and rises stiff with wrath</line>
      <line>If any alien foot profane the path.</line>
      <line>So too the buck that trimmed my terraces,</line>
      <line>Our whilome gardener, called the garden his;</line>
      <line>Who now, deposed, surveys my plain abode</line>
      <line>And his late kingdom, only from the road.</line>

      <line>As with heaped bees at hiving time</line>
      <line>The boughs are clotted, as (ere prime)</line>
      <line>Heaven swarms with stars, or the city street</line>
      <line>Pullulates with faring feet;</line>
      <line>So swarmed my senses once; that now</line>
      <line>Repose behind my tranquil brow,</line>
      <line>Unsealed, asleep, quiescent, clear;</line>
      <line>Now only the vast shapes I hear</line>
      <line>Hear—and my hearing slowly fills—</line>
      <line>Rivers and winds among the twisting hills,</line>
      <line>And hearken—and my face is lit—</line>
      <line>Life facing; death pursuing it.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>A square, squat room (a cellar on promotion),</line>
      <line>Drab to the soul, drab to the very daylight;</line>
      <line>Plasters astray in unnatural-looking tinware;</line>
      <line>Scissors and lint and apothecary’s jars.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Here, on a bench a skeleton would writhe from,</line>
      <line>Angry and sore, I wait to be admitted:</line>
      <line>Wait till my heart is lead upon my stomach,</line>
      <line>While at their ease two dressers do their chores.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>One has a probe—it feels to me a crowbar.</line>
      <line>A small boy sniffs and shudders after bluestone.</line>
      <line>A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers.</line>
      <line>Life is (I think) a blunder and a shame.</line>

      <line>You shall see her as a friend,</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ten heads and twenty hearts! so that this me,</line>
      <line>Having more room and verge, and striking less</line>
      <line>The cage that galls us into consciousness,</line>
      <line>Might drown the rings and ripples of to be</line>
      <line>In the smooth deep of being: plenary</line>
      <line>Round hours; great days, as if two days should press</line>
      <line>Together, and their wine-press’d night accresce</line>
      <line>The next night to so dead a parody</line>
      <line>Of death as cures such living: of these ordain</line>
      <line>My years; of those large years grant me not seven,</line>
      <line>Nor seventy, no, nor only seventy sevens!</line>
      <line>And then, perhaps, I might stand well in even</line>
      <line>This rain of things; down-rain, up-rain, side-rain;</line>
      <line>This rain from Earth and Ocean, air and heaven,</line>
      <line>And from the Heaven within the Heaven of Heavens.</line>

    </stanza>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A little time for speaking,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>A little time for saying</line>
      <line>Words the heart breaks to say;</line>

      <line>Then no more need for praying;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But long, long years to weep in,</line>

      <line>Great grief that desolates the soul,</line>
      <line>And eternity to sleep in.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Purple headland over yonder,</line>
      <line>Fleecy, sun-extinguished moon,</line>
      <line>I am here alone, and ponder</line>
      <line>On the theme of Afternoon.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Past has made a groove for Present,</line>
      <line>And what fits it is: no more.</line>
      <line>Waves before the wind are weighty;</line>
      <line>Strongest sea-beats shape the shore.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Just what is is just what can be,</line>
      <line>And the Possible is free;</line>
      <line>’Tis by being, not by effort,</line>
      <line>That the firm cliff juts to sea.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With an uncontentious calmness</line>
      <line>Drifts the Fact before the ‘Law’;</line>
      <line>So we name the ordered sequence</line>
      <line>We, remembering, foresaw.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And a law is mere procession</line>
      <line>Of the forcible and fit;</line>
      <line>Calm of uncontested Being,</line>
      <line>And our thought that comes of it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In the mellow shining daylight</line>
      <line>Lies the Afternoon at ease,</line>
      <line>Little willing ripples answer</line>
      <line>To a drift of casual breeze.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Purple headland to the westward!</line>
      <line>Ebbing tide, and fleecy moon!</line>

      <line>Grey the sky, and growing dimmer.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Hours of sunshine, hours of gloaming,</line>

      <line>Of unconsciousness, at night.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Just at sunset was translucence,</line>
      <line>When the west was all aflame;</line>
      <line>So I asked the sea a question,</line>
      <line>And an answer nearly came.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Is there nothing but Occurrence?</line>
      <line>Though each detail seem an Act,</line>
      <line>Is that whole we deem so pregnant</line>
      <line>But unemphasized Fact?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or, when dusk is in the hollows</line>
      <line>Of the hill-side and the wave,</line>
      <line>Are things just so much in earnest</line>
      <line>That they cannot but be grave?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Nay, the lesson of the Twilight</line>
      <line>Is as simple as ’tis deep;</line>
      <line>Acquiescence, acquiescence,</line>
      <line>And the coming on of sleep.</line>

      <line>‘Am I to lose you now?’ The words were light;</line>
      <line>You spoke them, hardly seeking a reply,</line>

      <line>The question echoed, dear, through many a night,—</line>
      <line>My question, not your own—most wistfully;</line>

      <line>His brown skin glisters warm and good,</line>
      <line>And his shadow stretches as full a height</line>
      <line>As a horse’s should;</line>
      <line>For on the wall</line>
      <line>As he slouches down</line>
      <line>Stalks a phantom, tall as he is tall</line>
      <line>And black as he is brown;</line>
      <line>With the very gait and the very speed</line>
      <line>Of his Highness shown,</line>
      <line>And I fear me a greed</line>
      <line>That matches his own;</line>
      <line>For if his head should stoop to treat</line>
      <line>With the wayside grasses—in a heat</line>
      <line>There stoops his friend’s,</line>
      <line>And their muzzles meet</line>
      <line>On the very tuft for which he contends.</line>

    <title>Crescent Moon</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>The moon had risen an hour or more.</line>
      <line>It was the younger moon, but shorn</line>
      <line>Of those first pointing cusps she wore,</line>
      <line>And bluff with blunted horn;</line>
      <line>But poised upright</line>
      <line>And golden bright,</line>
      <line>Save where there hung a middle haze,</line>
      <line>Soft as the golden air that lies</line>
      <line>Upon the sunset’s closing eyes</line>
      <line>And plays</line>
      <line>Between his glory-golden lids—</line>
      <line>And none forbids.</line>
      <line>And none forbade, as it did seem,</line>
      <line>That this lorn haze should doat and dream</line>
      <line>On such an eve of June</line>
      <line>And cling about the middle moon,</line>
      <line>That scarce was dimmer for such offending.</line>
      <line>But none might stay its soft ascending,</line>
      <line>Till each in turn the veiled old</line>
      <line>Was clear as dew,</line>
      <line>And all the new</line>
      <line>Was dusky gold;</line>
      <line>And last, a wraith,</line>
      <line>Exhaling like the breath</line>
      <line>We breathed upon a golden jar,</line>
      <line>Showed on the tip and went afar—</line>
      <line>Upon the disc a moving spot</line>
      <line>That would be, was, and now was not.</line>

    <title>Moon and Candle-light</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Beneath our eaves the moonbeams play,</line>
      <line>Where trumps of white convolvulus</line>
      <line>Lean out askance, and have their say</line>
      <line>Half to the moon and half to us.</line>
      <line>The foam-white tassel nestles still,</line>
      <line>Where the taperlight has laid,</line>
      <line>In its corner by the sill,</line>
      <line>A black tassel for a shade.</line>
      <line>It has laid the shadowy clasp</line>
      <line>Of the high-barred baby-chair</line>
      <line>On the milkwhite casement hasp.</line>
      <line>The moon clasps and holds it there</line>
      <line>With a darker, of her own</line>
      <line>Milkwhite standing casement bar:</line>
      <line>Dusky hands, thus all alone,</line>
      <line>Clasped in each as lovers’ are.</line>
      <line>Through the sea of mellow space,</line>
      <line>Where the moon and candle-light,</line>
      <line>Taking tender heart of grace,</line>
      <line>Mingle hands of holy white,</line>
      <line>The moon looks between the bars</line>
      <line>On the bar-flecked baby-seat,</line>
      <line>Thinks—She!—to wile away the scars.</line>
      <line>The taper smiles on her defeat.</line>
      <line>Smiles, too, a steady shadow down</line>
      <line>Between the fore and hinder stays</line>
      <line>Of the moon’s dais: with a frown</line>
      <line>The table greets the carpet grays.</line>
      <line>The moon turns to hide her smile . .</line>
      <line>Creep up the light two spokes of dust,</line>
      <line>Like light-streaks in a dusty aisle,</line>
      <line>Beneath the chair—midway, are thrust</line>
      <line>On the table shade in black.</line>
      <line>The taper shrugs and hums a tune,</line>
      <line>Two black crutches stumble back</line>
      <line>On the wainscot to the moon.</line>
      <line>... So the shadows make a raft</line>
      <line>Of the chamber gear to-night:</line>
      <line>Play cross-purpose fore and aft</line>
      <line>By the moon and candle-light.</line>

      <line>In large white flakes falling on the city brown,</line>
      <line>Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying,</line>
      <line>Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town;</line>
      <line>Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;</line>
      <line>Lazily and incessantly floating down and down:</line>
      <line>Silently sifting and veiling road, roof and railing;</line>
      <line>Hiding difference, making unevenness even,</line>
      <line>Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.</line>
      <line>All night it fell, and when full inches seven</line>
      <line>It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,</line>
      <line>The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven;</line>
      <line>And all woke earlier for the unaccustomed brightness</line>
      <line>Of the winter dawning, the strange unheavenly glare:</line>
      <line>The eye marvelled—marvelled at the dazzling whiteness;</line>
      <line>The ear hearkened to the stillness of the solemn air;</line>
      <line>No sound of wheel rumbling nor of foot falling,</line>
      <line>And the busy morning cries came thin and spare.</line>
      <line>Then boys I heard, as they went to school, calling,</line>
      <line>They gathered up the crystal manna to freeze</line>
      <line>Their tongues with tasting, their hands with snowballing;</line>
      <line>Or rioted in a drift, plunging up to the knees;</line>
      <line>Or peering up from under the white-mossed wonder,</line>
      <line>‘O look at the trees!’ they cried, ‘O look at the trees!’</line>
      <line>With lessened load a few carts creak and blunder,</line>
      <line>Following along the white deserted way,</line>
      <line>A country company long dispersed asunder:</line>
      <line>When now already the sun, in pale display</line>
      <line>Standing by Paul’s high dome, spread forth below</line>
      <line>His sparkling beams, and awoke the stir of the day.</line>
      <line>For now doors open, and war is waged with the snow;</line>
      <line>And trains of sombre men, past tale of number,</line>
      <line>Tread long brown paths, as toward their toil they go:</line>
      <line>But even for them awhile no cares encumber</line>
      <line>Their minds diverted; the daily word is unspoken,</line>
      <line>The daily thoughts of labour and sorrow slumber</line>
      <line>At the sight of the beauty that greets them, for the charm they have broken.</line>

    <title>On a Dead Child</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Perfect little body, without fault or stain on thee,</line>
      <line>With promise of strength and manhood full and fair!</line>
      <line>Though cold and stark and bare,</line>
      <line>The bloom and the charm of life doth awhile remain on thee.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thy mother’s treasure wert thou;—alas! no longer</line>
      <line>To visit her heart with wondrous joy; to be</line>
      <line>Thy father’s pride;—ah, he</line>
      <line>Must gather his faith together, and his strength make stronger.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>To me, as I move thee now in the last duty,</line>
      <line>Dost thou with a turn or gesture anon respond;</line>
      <line>Startling my fancy fond</line>
      <line>With a chance attitude of the head, a freak of beauty.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Thy hand clasps, as ’twas wont, my finger, and holds it:</line>
      <line>But the grasp is the clasp of Death, heartbreaking and stiff;</line>
      <line>Yet feels to my hand as if</line>
      <line>’Twas still thy will, thy pleasure and trust that enfolds it.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So I lay thee there, thy sunken eyelids closing,—</line>
      <line>Go lie thou there in thy coffin, thy last little bed!—</line>
      <line>Propping thy wise, sad head,</line>
      <line>Thy firm, pale hands across thy chest disposing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So quiet! doth the change content thee?—Death, whither hath he taken thee?</line>
      <line>To a world, do I think, that rights the disaster of this?</line>
      <line>The vision of which I miss,</line>
      <line>Who weep for the body, and wish but to warm thee and awaken thee?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Ah! little at best can all our hopes avail us</line>
      <line>To lift this sorrow, or cheer us, when in the dark,</line>
      <line>Unwilling, alone we embark,</line>
      <line>And the things we have seen and have known and have heard of, fail us.</line>

      <line>Only content and we are here,</line>

    <title>Among His Books</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>A silent room—gray with a dusty blight</line>
      <line>Of loneliness;</line>
      <line>A room with not enough of life or light</line>
      <line>Its form to dress.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Books enough though! The groaning sofa bears</line>
      <line>A goodly store—</line>
      <line>Books on the window-seat, and on the chairs,</line>
      <line>And on the floor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Books of all sorts of soul, all sorts of age,</line>
      <line>All sorts of face—</line>
      <line>Black-letter, vellum, and the flimsy page</line>
      <line>Of commonplace.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All bindings, from the cloth whose hue distracts</line>
      <line>One’s weary nerves,</line>
      <line>To yellow parchment, binding rare old tracts</line>
      <line>It serves—deserves.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Books on the shelves, and in the cupboard books,</line>
      <line>Worthless and rare—</line>
      <line>Books on the mantelpiece—where’er one looks</line>
      <line>Books everywhere!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Books! books! the only things in life I find</line>
      <line>Not wholly vain.</line>
      <line>Books in my hands—books in my heart enshrined—</line>
      <line>Books in my brain.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>My friends are they: for children and for wife</line>
      <line>They serve me too;</line>
      <line>For these alone, of all dear things in life,</line>
      <line>Have I found true.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They do not flatter, change, deny, deceive—</line>
      <line>Ah no—not they!</line>
      <line>The same editions which one night you leave</line>
      <line>You find next day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You don’t find railway novels where you left</line>
      <line>Your Elzevirs!</line>
      <line>Your Aldines don’t betray you—leave bereft</line>
      <line>Your lonely years!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And yet this common book of Common Prayer</line>
      <line>My heart prefers,</line>
      <line>Because the names upon the fly-leaf there</line>
      <line>Are mine and hers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It’s a dead flower that makes it open so—</line>
      <line>Forget-me-not—</line>
      <line>The Marriage Service ... well, my dear, you know</line>
      <line>Who first forgot.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Those were the days when in the choir we two</line>
      <line>Sat—used to sing—</line>
      <line>When I believed in God, in love, in you—</line>
      <line>In everything.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Through quiet lanes to church we used to come,</line>
      <line>Happy and good,</line>
      <line>Clasp hands through sermon, and go slowly home</line>
      <line>Down through the wood.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Kisses? A certain yellow rose no doubt</line>
      <line>That porch still shows,</line>
      <line>Whenever I hear kisses talked about</line>
      <line>I smell that rose!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>No—I don’t blame you—since you only proved</line>
      <line>My choice unwise,</line>
      <line>And taught me books should trusted be and loved,</line>
      <line>Not lips and eyes!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And so I keep your book—your flower—to show</line>
      <line>How much I care</line>
      <line>For the dear memory of what, you know,</line>
      <line>You never were.</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They will not leave me in the day</line>

      <line>Sings a gentleman of England cleanly bred, machinely crammed,</line>
      <line>And a trooper of the Empress, if you please.</line>
      <line>Yes, a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses,</line>
      <line>And faith he went the pace and went it blind,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>In the Neolithic Age savage warfare did I wage</line>
      <line>For food and fame and woolly horses’ pelt.</line>
      <line>I was singer to my clan in that dim, red Dawn of Man,</line>
      <line>And I sang of all we fought and feared and felt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yea, I sang as now I sing, when the Prehistoric spring</line>
      <line>Made the piled Biscayan ice-pack split and shove;</line>
      <line>And the troll and gnome and dwerg, and the Gods of Cliff and Berg</line>
      <line>Were about me and beneath me and above.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But a rival of Solutre, told the tribe my style was outre—</line>
      <line>’Neath a tomahawk, of diorite, he fell.</line>
      <line>And I left my views on Art, barbed and tanged, below the heart</line>
      <line>Of a mammothistic etcher at Grenelle.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then I stripped them, scalp from skull, and my hunting-dogs fed full,</line>
      <line>And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong;</line>
      <line>And I wiped my mouth and said, ‘It is well that they are dead,</line>
      <line>‘For I know my work is right and theirs was wrong’.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But my Totem saw the shame; from his ridgepole-shrine he came,</line>
      <line>And he told me in a vision of the night:—</line>
      <line>‘There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,</line>
      <line>‘And every single one of them is right!’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Then the silence closed upon me till They put new clothing on me</line>
      <line>Of whiter, weaker flesh and bone more frail;</line>
      <line>And I stepped beneath Time’s finger, once again a tribal singer,</line>
      <line>And a minor poet certified by Traill!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Still they skirmish to and fro, men my messmates on the snow,</line>
      <line>When we headed off the aurochs turn for turn;</line>
      <line>When the rich Allobrogenses never kept amanuenses,</line>

      <line>Still a cultured Christian age sees us scuffle, squeak, and rage,</line>

      <line>A fool there was and he made his prayer</line>

      <line>To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair</line>

      <line>Honour and faith and a sure intent</line>

      <line>Which she might have seen when she threw him aside—</line>

      <line>So some of him lived but the most of him died—</line>
      <line>(Even as you and I!)</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>And it isn't the shame and it isn’t the blame</line>
      <line>That stings like a white hot brand— 30</line>

      <line>(Seeing, at last, she could never know why)</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>He did not wear his scarlet coat,</line>
      <line>For blood and wine are red,</line>
      <line>And blood and wine were on his hands</line>
      <line>When they found him with the dead,</line>
      <line>The poor dead woman whom he loved,</line>
      <line>And murdered in her bed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He walked amongst the Trial Men</line>
      <line>In a suit of shabby gray;</line>
      <line>A cricket cap was on his head,</line>
      <line>And his step seemed light and gay;</line>
      <line>But I never saw a man who looked</line>
      <line>So wistfully at the day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I never saw a man who looked</line>
      <line>With such a wistful eye</line>
      <line>Upon that little tent of blue</line>
      <line>Which prisoners call the sky,</line>
      <line>And at every drifting cloud that went</line>
      <line>With sails of silver by.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I walked, with other souls in pain,</line>
      <line>Within another ring,</line>
      <line>And was wondering if the man had done</line>
      <line>A great or little thing,</line>
      <line>When a voice behind me whispered low,</line>
      <line>‘That fellow's got to swing.'</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dear Christ! the very prison walls</line>
      <line>Suddenly seemed to reel,</line>
      <line>And the sky above my head became</line>
      <line>Like a casque of scorching steel;</line>
      <line>And, though I was a soul in pain,</line>
      <line>My pain I could not feel.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I only knew what hunted thought</line>
      <line>Quickened his step, and why</line>
      <line>He looked upon the garish day</line>
      <line>With such a wistful eye;</line>
      <line>The man had killed the thing he loved,</line>
      <line>And so he had to die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet each man kills the thing he loves,</line>
      <line>By each let this be heard,</line>
      <line>Some do it with a bitter look,</line>
      <line>Some with a flattering word,</line>
      <line>The coward does it with a kiss,</line>
      <line>The brave man with a sword!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some kill their love when they are young,</line>
      <line>And some when they are old;</line>
      <line>Some strangle with the hands of Lust,</line>
      <line>Some with the hands of Gold:</line>
      <line>The kindest use a knife, because</line>
      <line>The dead so soon grow cold.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Some love too little, some too long,</line>
      <line>Some sell, and others buy;</line>
      <line>Some do the deed with many tears,</line>
      <line>And some without a sigh:</line>
      <line>For each man kills the thing he loves.</line>
      <line>Yet each man does not die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not die a death of shame</line>
      <line>On a day of dark disgrace,</line>
      <line>Nor have a noose about his neck,</line>
      <line>Nor a cloth upon his face,</line>
      <line>Nor drop feet foremost through the floor</line>
      <line>Into an empty space.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not sit with silent men</line>
      <line>Who watch him night and day;</line>
      <line>Who watch him when he tries to weep,</line>
      <line>And when he tries to pray;</line>
      <line>Who watch him lest himself should rob</line>
      <line>The prison of its prey.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not wake at dawn to see</line>
      <line>Dread figures throng his room,</line>
      <line>The shivering Chaplain robed in white,</line>
      <line>The Sheriff stern with gloom,</line>
      <line>And the Governor all in shiny black,</line>
      <line>With the yellow face of Doom.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not rise in piteous haste</line>
      <line>To put on convict-clothes,</line>
      <line>While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes</line>
      <line>Each new and nerve-twitched pose,</line>
      <line>Fingering a watch whose little ticks</line>
      <line>Are like horrible hammer-blows.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not know that sickening thirst</line>
      <line>That sands one’s throat, before</line>
      <line>The hangman with his gardener’s gloves</line>
      <line>Slips through the padded door,</line>
      <line>And binds one with three leathern thongs,</line>
      <line>That the throat may thirst no more.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not bend his head to hear</line>
      <line>The Burial Office read,</line>
      <line>Nor, while the terror of his soul</line>
      <line>Tells him he is not dead,</line>
      <line>Cross his own coffin, as he moves</line>
      <line>Into the hideous shed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He does not stare upon the air</line>
      <line>Through a little roof of glass:</line>
      <line>He does not pray with lips of clay</line>
      <line>For his agony to pass;</line>
      <line>Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek</line>
      <line>The kiss of Caiaphas.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>In Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,</line>
      <line>And the dripping wall is high,</line>
      <line>So it was there he took the air</line>
      <line>Beneath the leaden sky,</line>
      <line>And by each side a Warder walked,</line>
      <line>For fear the man might die.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or else he sat with those who watched</line>
      <line>His anguish night and day;</line>
      <line>Who watched him when he rose to weep,</line>
      <line>And when he crouched to pray;</line>
      <line>Who watched him lest himself should rob</line>
      <line>Their scaffold of its prey.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Governor was strong upon</line>
      <line>The Regulations Act:</line>
      <line>The Doctor said that Death was but</line>
      <line>A scientific fact:</line>
      <line>And twice a day the Chaplain called,</line>
      <line>And left a little tract.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And twice a day he smoked his pipe,</line>
      <line>And drank his quart of beer:</line>
      <line>His soul was resolute, and held</line>
      <line>No hiding-place for fear;</line>
      <line>He often said that he was glad</line>
      <line>The hangman’s hands were near.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But why he said so strange a thing</line>
      <line>No Warder dared to ask:</line>
      <line>For he to whom a watcher’s doom</line>
      <line>Is given as his task,</line>
      <line>Must set a lock upon his lips,</line>
      <line>And make his face a mask.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or else he might be moved, and try</line>
      <line>To comfort or console:</line>
      <line>And what should Human Pity do</line>
      <line>Pent up in Murderers’ Hole?</line>
      <line>What word of grace in such a place</line>
      <line>Could help a brother’s soul?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With slouch and swing around the ring</line>
      <line>We trod the Fools’ Parade!</line>
      <line>We did not care: we knew we were</line>
      <line>The Devil’s Own Brigade:</line>
      <line>And shaven head and feet of lead</line>
      <line>Make a merry masquerade.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We tore the tarry rope to shreds</line>
      <line>With blunt and bleeding nails;</line>
      <line>We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,</line>
      <line>And cleaned the shining rails:</line>
      <line>And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,</line>
      <line>And clattered with the pails.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,</line>
      <line>We turned the dusty drill:</line>
      <line>We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,</line>
      <line>And sweated on the mill:</line>
      <line>But in the heart of every man</line>
      <line>Terror was lying still.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So still it lay that every day</line>
      <line>Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:</line>
      <line>And we forgot the bitter lot</line>
      <line>That waits for fool and knave,</line>
      <line>Till once, as we tramped in from work,</line>
      <line>We passed an open grave.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With yawning mouth the yellow hole</line>
      <line>Gaped for a living thing;</line>
      <line>The very mud cried out for blood</line>
      <line>To the thirsty asphalte ring:</line>
      <line>And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair</line>
      <line>Some prisoner had to swing.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Right in we went, with soul intent</line>
      <line>On Death and Dread and Doom:</line>
      <line>The hangman, with his little bag,</line>
      <line>Went shuffling through the gloom:</line>
      <line>And each man trembled as he crept</line>
      <line>Into his numbered tomb.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That night the empty corridors</line>
      <line>Were full of forms of Fear,</line>
      <line>And up and down the iron town</line>
      <line>Stole feet we could not hear,</line>
      <line>And through the bars that hide the stars</line>
      <line>White faces seemed to peer.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He lay as one who lies and dreams</line>
      <line>In a pleasant meadow-land,</line>
      <line>The watchers watched him as he slept,</line>
      <line>And could not understand</line>
      <line>How one could sleep so sweet a sleep</line>
      <line>With a hangman close at hand.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But there is no sleep when men must weep</line>
      <line>Who never yet have wept:</line>
      <line>So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—</line>
      <line>That endless vigil kept,</line>
      <line>And through each brain on hands of pain</line>
      <line>Another’s terror crept.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Alas! it is a fearful thing</line>
      <line>To feel another’s guilt!</line>
      <line>For, right within, the sword of Sin</line>
      <line>Pierced to its poisoned hilt,</line>
      <line>And as molten lead were the tears we shed</line>
      <line>For the blood we had not spilt.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Warders with their shoes of felt</line>
      <line>Crept by each padlocked door,</line>
      <line>And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,</line>
      <line>Grey figures on the floor,</line>
      <line>And wondered why men knelt to pray</line>
      <line>Who never prayed before.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>All through the night we knelt and prayed,</line>

      <line>The plumes upon a hearse:</line>
      <line>And bitter wine upon a sponge</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,</line>
      <line>But never came the day: no</line>
      <line>And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,</line>
      <line>In the corners where we lay:</line>
      <line>And each evil sprite that walks by night</line>
      <line>Before us seemed to play.</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>They glided past, they glided fast,</line>
      <line>Like travellers through a mist:</line>
      <line>They mocked the moon in a rigadoon</line>
      <line>Of delicate turn and twist,</line>
      <line>And with formal pace and loathsome grace</line>
      <line>The phantoms kept their tryst.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With mop and mow, we saw them go,</line>
      <line>Slim shadows hand in hand:</line>
      <line>About, about, in ghostly rout</line>
      <line>They trod a saraband:</line>
      <line>And the damned grotesques made arabesques,</line>
      <line>Like the wind upon the sand!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With the pirouettes of marionettes,</line>
      <line>They tripped on pointed tread:</line>
      <line>But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,</line>
      <line>As their grisly masque they led,</line>
      <line>And loud they sang, and long they sang,</line>
      <line>For they sang to wake the dead.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>‘Oho!’ they cried, ‘The world is wide,</line>

      <line>And once, or twice, to throw the dice</line>
      <line>Is a gentlemanly game,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>No things of air these antics were,</line>

      <line>To men whose lives were held in gyves,</line>
      <line>And whose feet might not go free,</line>
      <line>Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,</line>
      <line>Most terrible to see.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Around, around, they waltzed and wound;</line>
      <line>Some wheeled in smirking pairs;</line>
      <line>With the mincing step of a demirep</line>
      <line>Some sidled up the stairs:</line>
      <line>And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,</line>
      <line>Each helped us at our prayers.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The morning wind began to moan,</line>
      <line>But still the night went on:</line>
      <line>Through its giant loom the web of gloom</line>
      <line>Crept till each thread was spun:</line>
      <line>And, as we prayed, we grew afraid</line>
      <line>Of the Justice of the Sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The moaning wind went wandering round</line>
      <line>The weeping prison-wall:</line>
      <line>Till like a wheel of turning steel</line>
      <line>We felt the minutes crawl:</line>
      <line>O moaning wind! what had we done</line>
      <line>To have such a seneschal?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At last I saw the shadowed bars,</line>
      <line>Like a lattice wrought in lead,</line>
      <line>Move right across the whitewashed wall</line>
      <line>That faced my three-plank bed,</line>
      <line>And I knew that somewhere in the world</line>
      <line>God’s dreadful dawn was red.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,</line>
      <line>At seven all was still,</line>
      <line>But the sough and swing of a mighty wing</line>
      <line>The prison seemed to fill,</line>
      <line>For the Lord of Death with icy breath</line>
      <line>Had entered in to kill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He did not pass in purple pomp,</line>
      <line>Nor ride a moon-white steed.</line>
      <line>Three yards of cord and a sliding board</line>
      <line>Are all the gallows’ need:</line>
      <line>So with rope of shame the Herald came</line>
      <line>To do the secret deed.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We were as men who through a fen</line>
      <line>Of filthy darkness grope:</line>
      <line>We did not dare to breathe a prayer,</line>
      <line>Or to give our anguish scope:</line>
      <line>Something was dead in each of us,</line>
      <line>And what was dead was Hope.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,</line>
      <line>And will not swerve aside:</line>
      <line>It slays the weak, it slays the strong,</line>
      <line>It has a deadly stride:</line>
      <line>With iron heel it slays the strong,</line>
      <line>The monstrous parricide!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We waited for the stroke of eight:</line>
      <line>Each tongue was thick with thirst:</line>
      <line>For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate</line>
      <line>That makes a man accursed,</line>
      <line>And Fate will use a running noose</line>
      <line>For the best man and the worst.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>We had no other thing to do,</line>
      <line>Save to wait for the sign to come:</line>
      <line>So, like things of stone in a valley lone,</line>
      <line>Quiet we sat and dumb:</line>
      <line>But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,</line>
      <line>Like a madman on a drum!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With sudden shock the prison-clock</line>
      <line>Smote on the shivering air,</line>
      <line>And from all the gaol rose up a wail</line>
      <line>Of impotent despair,</line>
      <line>Like the sound that frightened marshes hear</line>
      <line>From some leper in his lair.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And as one sees most fearful things</line>
      <line>In the crystal of a dream,</line>
      <line>We saw the greasy hempen rope</line>
      <line>Hooked to the blackened beam,</line>
      <line>And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare</line>
      <line>Strangled into a scream.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And all the woe that moved him so</line>
      <line>That he gave that bitter cry,</line>
      <line>And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,</line>
      <line>None knew so well as I:</line>
      <line>For he who lives more lives than one</line>
      <line>More deaths than one must die.</line>

      <line>Lit in a land of furnaces by night:</line>

      <line>Came like faint music down the distant air.</line>

      <line>About her, looked the sorrow of her ways:</line>
      <line>If light there be, the dark hills are to climb</line>
      <line>First: and if calm, far over the long sea.</line>
      <line>Fallen from all the world apart she seemed,</line>
      <line>Into a silence and a memory.</line>
      <line>What had the thin hands done, that now they strained</line>
      <line>Together in such passion? And those eyes,</line>
      <line>What saw they long ago, that now they dreamed</line>
      <line>Along the busy streets, blind but to dreams?</line>
      <line>Her white lips mocked the world, and all therein:</line>
      <line>She had known more than this; she wanted not</line>
      <line>This, who had known the past so great a thing.</line>
      <line>Moving about our ways, herself she moved</line>
      <line>In things done, years remembered, places gone.</line>
      <line>Lonely, amid the living crowds, as dead,</line>
      <line>She walked with wonderful and sad regard:</line>
      <line>With us, her passing image: but herself</line>

      <line>S o we must part, my body, you and I</line>
      <line>Who’ve spent so many pleasant years together.</line>
      <line>’Tis sorry work to lose your company</line>
      <line>Who clove to me so close, whate’er the weather,</line>
      <line>From winter unto winter, wet or dry;</line>
      <line>But you have reached the limit of your tether,</line>
      <line>And I must journey on my way alone,</line>
      <line>And leave you quietly beneath a stone.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They say that you are altogether bad</line>
      <line>(Forgive me, ’tis not my experience),</line>
      <line>And think me very wicked to be sad</line>
      <line>At leaving you, a clod, a prison, whence</line>
      <line>To get quite free I should be very glad.</line>
      <line>Perhaps I may be so, some few days hence,</line>
      <line>But now, methinks, ’twere graceless not to spend</line>
      <line>A tear or two on my departing friend.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Now our long partnership is near completed,</line>
      <line>And I look back upon its history;</line>
      <line>I greatly fear I have not always treated</line>
      <line>You with the honesty you showed to me.</line>
      <line>And I must own that you have oft defeated</line>
      <line>Unworthy schemes by your sincerity,</line>
      <line>And by a blush or stammering tongue have tried</line>
      <line>To make me think again before I lied.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>’Tis true you’re not so handsome as you were,</line>
      <line>But that’s not your fault and is partly mine.</line>
      <line>You might have lasted longer with more care,</line>
      <line>And still looked something like your first design;</line>
      <line>And even now, with all your wear and tear,</line>
      <line>’Tis pitiful to think I must resign</line>
      <line>You to the friendless grave, the patient prey</line>
      <line>Of all the hungry legions of Decay.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But you must stay, dear body, and I go.</line>
      <line>And I was once so very proud of you:</line>
      <line>You made my mother’s eyes to overflow</line>
      <line>When first she saw you, wonderful and new.</line>
      <line>And now, with all your faults, ’twere hard to find</line>
      <line>A slave more willing or a friend more true.</line>
      <line>Ay—even they who say the worst about you</line>
      <line>Can scarcely tell what I shall do without you.</line>

      <line>No other maiden had my skill</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Again I laugh, and step alone,</line>

      <line>His strong hand closes.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But Allan now seeks staid delight,</line>
      <line>His son there, brought my niece to-night</line>
      <line>These early roses.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>As I was strolling lonely in the Backs,</line>
      <line>I met a woman whom I did not like.</line>
      <line>I did not like the way the woman walked:</line>
      <line>Loose-hipped, big-boned, disjointed, angular.</line>
      <line>If her anatomy comprised a waist,</line>
      <line>I did not notice it: she had a face</line>
      <line>With eyes and lips adjusted thereunto,</line>
      <line>But round her mouth no pleasing shadows stirred,</line>
      <line>Nor did her eyes invite a second glance.</line>
      <line>Her dress was absolutely colourless,</line>
      <line>Devoid of taste or shape or character;</line>
      <line>Her boots were rather old, and rather large,</line>
      <line>And rather shabby, not precisely matched.</line>
      <line>Her hair was very far from beautiful</line>
      <line>And not abundant: she had such a hat</line>
      <line>As neither merits nor expects remark.</line>
      <line>She was not clever, I am very sure,</line>
      <line>Nor witty nor amusing; well-informed</line>
      <line>She may have been, and kind, perhaps, of heart;</line>
      <line>But gossip was writ plain upon her face.</line>
      <line>And so she stalked her dull unthinking way;</line>
      <line>Or, if she thought of anything, it was</line>
      <line>That such a one had got a second class,</line>
      <line>Or Mrs So-and-So a second child.</line>
      <line>I do not want to see that girl again:</line>
      <line>I do not like her: and I should not mind</line>
      <line>If she were done away with, killed, or ploughed.</line>
      <line>She did not seem to serve a useful end:</line>
      <line>And certainly she was not beautiful.</line>

    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>Love is what lacks then: but what does it mean to you</line>
      <line>Where did you hear of it, feel it, or see?</line>
      <line>What has the truth, or the good of it been to you?</line>
      <line>How love some other, yet nohow love me?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If there were any conspicuous fault in me,</line>
      <line>Any defect it were torture to bear,</line>
      <line>Low-lying levels, too deep to exalt, in me,</line>
      <line>Dread possibilities in me to fear:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>If I were ugly or old or untractable,</line>
      <line>Mean in my methods or low in my views:</line>
      <line>If I were dull or unpleasant: in fact able</line>
      <line>Neither to please, nor elate, nor amuse:—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That makes you angry, impatient; we’ll take it, then,</line>
      <line>I am a man that to know’s to esteem:</line>
      <line>That’s the admission you make to me: make it then:</line>
      <line>Well why not love me? what’s love but a dream?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Only of course in the sense you bestow on it:</line>
      <line>I have a meaning for love, that is plain:</line>
      <line>Further than passion, and longing, and so on, it</line>
      <line>Means to me liking and liking again:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Liking, and liking, and liking—that’s plain enough;—</line>
      <line>Something depending on qualities then?</line>
      <line>Yes: for they give you both pleasure and pain enough,</line>
      <line>Qualities common in women and men.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Still not a doubt that, the love being brought about,</line>
      <line>Liking made love, there is more that will come:</line>
      <line>All the good qualities ever yet thought about:—</line>
      <line>Yes, they fall short of that excellent sum.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Like a man: like him: and let there be more of it,</line>
      <line>That which he is he’ll be liked for: at last</line>
      <line>Love in a minute will flash—I am sure of it—</line>
      <line>Whether the wedding be future or past.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You who consider it quite immaterial</line>
      <line>Whether the person is worthy or not:</line>
      <line>You who are looking for something ethereal,</line>
      <line>Something celestial, transcending our lot:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You to whom every excellent quality</line>
      <line>Means but a cypher: who hope to behold</line>
      <line>Love at a burst in his mighty totality</line>
      <line>Change all the grey of the world into gold:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You dream a priceless love: I feel a penny one:</line>
      <line>My reason plods, while your fancy can range:—</line>
      <line>Therefore, I ask, since you’ll never love any one,</line>
      <line>Why should you not marry me for a change?</line>

      <line>She’s not an angel in disguise:</line>

      <line>She’s not an unexampled prize:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She does not always see the point</line>
      <line>Of little jests her husband makes:</line>
      <line>And, when the world is out of joint,</line>
      <line>She makes a hundred small mistakes:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>She’s not a miracle of tact:</line>
      <line>Her temper’s not the best I know:</line>
      <line>She’s got her little faults in fact,</line>
      <line>Although I never tell her so.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But this, my wife, is why I hold you</line>
      <line>As good a wife as ever stepped,</line>
      <line>And why I meant it when I told you</line>
      <line>How cordially our feast I kept:</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You’ve lived with me these fifty years,</line>
      <line>And all the time you loved me dearly:</line>
      <line>I may have given you cause for tears:</line>
      <line>I may have acted rather queerly.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I ceased to love you long ago:</line>
      <line>I loved another for a season:</line>
      <line>As time went on I came to know</line>
      <line>Your worth, my wife: and saw the reason</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Why such a wife as you have been</line>
      <line>Is more than worth the world beside;</line>
      <line>You loved me all the time, my Queen;</line>
      <line>You couldn’t help it if you tried.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You loved me as I once loved you,</line>
      <line>As each loved each beside the altar:</line>
      <line>And whatsoever I might do,</line>
      <line>Your loyal heart could never falter.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, if you sometimes fail me, sweetest,</line>
      <line>And don’t appreciate me, dear,</line>
      <line>No matter: such defects are meetest</line>
      <line>For poor humanity, I fear.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And all’s forgiven, all’s forgot,</line>
      <line>On this our golden wedding day;</line>
      <line>For, see! she loves me: does she not?</line>
      <line>So let the world e’en go its way.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I’m old and nearly useless now,</line>
      <line>Each day a greater weakling proves me:</line>
      <line>There’s compensation anyhow:</line>
      <line>I still possess a wife that loves me.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Dear worthy husband! good old man!</line>
      <line>Fit hero of a golden marriage:</line>
      <line>I’ll show towards you, if I can,</line>
      <line>An absolutely wifely carriage.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The months or years which your career</line>
      <line>May still comprise before you perish,</line>
      <line>Shall serve to prove that I, my dear,</line>
      <line>Can honour, and obey, and cherish.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Till death us part, as soon he must,</line>
      <line>(And you, my dear, should show the way)</line>
      <line>I hope you’ll always find me just</line>
      <line>The same as on our wedding day.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I never loved you, dearest: never!</line>
      <line>Let that be clearly understood:</line>
      <line>I thought you good, and rather clever,</line>
      <line>And found you really rather good.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And, what was more, I loved another,</line>
      <line>But couldn’t get him: well, but, then</line>
      <line>You’re just as bad, my erring brother,</line>
      <line>You most impeccable of men:—</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Except for this: my love was married</line>
      <line>Some weeks before I married you:</line>
      <line>While you, my amorous dawdler, tarried</line>
      <line>Till we’d been wed a year or two.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You loved me at our wedding: I</line>
      <line>Loved some one else: and after that</line>
      <line>I never cast a loving eye</line>
      <line>On others: you—well, tit for tat!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But after all I made you cheerful:</line>
      <line>Your whims I’ve humoured: saw the point</line>
      <line>Of all your jokes: grew duly tearful,</line>
      <line>When you were sad, yet chose the joint</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>You liked the best of all for dinner,</line>
      <line>And soothed you in your hours of woe:</line>
      <line>Although a miserable sinner,</line>
      <line>I am a good wife, as wives go.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I bore with you and took your side,</line>
      <line>And kept my temper all the time:</line>
      <line>I never flirted; never cried,</line>
      <line>Nor ranked it as a heinous crime,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When you preferred another lady,</line>
      <line>Or used improper words to me,</line>
      <line>Or told a story more than shady,</line>
      <line>Or snored and snorted after tea,</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Or otherwise gave proofs of being</line>
      <line>A dull and rather vain old man:</line>
      <line>I still succeeded in agreeing</line>
      <line>With all you said, (the safest plan),</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet always strove my point to carry,</line>
      <line>And make you do as I desired:</line>

      <line>They hit on just what I required.</line>

      <line>Had love been wanted—well, I couldn’t</line>

      <line>I would not waken you: nay! this is fitter;</line>

    <title>The Barber</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I dreamed I was a barber; and there went</line>
      <line>Beneath my hand, oh! manes extravagant.</line>
      <line>Beneath my trembling fingers, many a mask</line>
      <line>Of many a pleasant girl. It was my task</line>
      <line>To gild their hair, carefully, strand by strand;</line>
      <line>To paint their eyebrows with a timid hand;</line>
      <line>To draw a bodkin, from a vase of kohl,</line>
      <line>Through the closed lashes; pencils from a bowl</line>
      <line>Of sepia to paint them underneath;</line>
      <line>To blow upon their eyes with a soft breath.</line>
      <line>They lay them back and watched the leaping bands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The dream grew vague. I moulded with my hands</line>
      <line>The mobile breasts, the valley; and the waist</line>
      <line>I touched; and pigments reverently placed</line>
      <line>Upon their thighs in sapient spots and stains,</line>
      <line>Beryls and crysolites and diaphanes,</line>
      <line>And gems whose hot harsh names are never said.</line>
      <line>I was a masseur; and my fingers bled</line>
      <line>With wonder as I touched their awful limbs.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Suddenly, in the marble trough, there seems</line>
      <line>O, last of my pale mistresses, Sweetness!</line>
      <line>A twy-lipped scarlet pansie. My caress</line>
      <line>Tinges thy steelgray eyes to violet.</line>
      <line>Adown thy body skips the pit-a-pat</line>
      <line>Of treatment once heard in a hospital</line>
      <line>For plagues that fascinate, but half appal.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>So, at the sound, the blood of me stood cold.</line>
      <line>The chaste hair ripened into sullen gold.</line>
      <line>The throat, the shoulders, swelled and were uncouth.</line>
      <line>The breasts rose up and offered each a mouth.</line>
      <line>And on the belly pallid blushes crept,</line>
      <line>That maddened me, until I laughed and wept.</line>

      <line>The triple coil of her hair she wound.</line>
      <line>And stroked his limbs with a humming sound.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Mishka is white like a hunter’s son;</line>

      <line>When all her kisses are joined in one,</line>
      <line>And his body is bathed in grass and sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The shadows lie mauven beneath the trees,</line>
      <line>And purple stains, where the finches pass,</line>
      <line>Leap in the stalks of the deep, rank grass.</line>
      <line>Flutter of wing, and the buzz of bees,</line>
      <line>Deepen the silence, and sweeten ease.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The honey-child is an olive tree,</line>
      <line>The voice of birds and the voice of flowers,</line>
      <line>Each of them all and all the hours,</line>
      <line>The honey-child is a winged bee,</line>
      <line>Her touch is a perfume, a melody.</line>

      <line>They say, in other days,</line>
      <line>When Jove in Heaven, and Pluto ruled in Hell,</line>
      <line>Man, walking in a haze,</line>

      <line>So, when he came to Dis,</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>They say that many a prince</line>

      <line>Then Pluto judged; that is to say, his face was bare;</line>

      <line>After six days we sight the coast,</line>

      <line>mean junk and proud, by my palace side.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For there lives a junk in that ancient sea</line>

      <line>Its walls are painted water-green</line>
      <line>like the green sea’s self, both shade and sheen,</line>

      <line>Hang loves not that the same should fly.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>In midst of the first a painted sun</line>
      <line>gleams gold like the celestial yon;</line>

      <line>For wind and water a goodlier junk</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His head is brave with a lacquered casque,</line>

      <line>he frowns like a devil, devil-wise;</line>
    </stanza>

      <line>his eyeballs start; his mask is red</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>he hath never a foot on which to stand;</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>He leaps from the sea with a silken swish;</line>

      <line>Scaled bird, how his snout and gills dilate,</line>

    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He prays the Maker of water-things</line>
      <line>not for a sword, but cricket’s wings,</line>
      <line>not to be one of the sons of air,</line>
      <line>to be rid of the water is all his prayer;</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>all his hope is a fear-whipped whim;</line>
      <line>all directions are one to him.</line>
      <line>There are seekers of wisdom no less absurd,</line>
      <line>son Hang, than thy fish that would be a bird.</line>

      <line>Laugh even in winter time; the bubbly rills</line>
      <line>Dance down their grades, and fill with melody</line>
      <line>The fishers’ hearts; for these, where’er they be,</line>

      <line>From emerald fat field and gorse gold lea.</line>

    <title>Thirty Bob a Week</title>
    <lines>
    <stanza>
      <line>I couldn’t touch a stop and turn a screw,</line>
      <line>And set the blooming world a-work for me,</line>
      <line>Like such as cut their teeth—I hope, like you—</line>
      <line>On the handle of a skeleton gold key;</line>
      <line>I cut mine on a leek, which I eat it every week:</line>
      <line>I’m a clerk at thirty bob as you can see.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But I don’t allow it’s luck and all a toss;</line>
      <line>There’s no such thing as being starred and crossed;</line>
      <line>It’s just the power of some to be a boss,</line>
      <line>And the bally power of others to be bossed:</line>
      <line>I face the music, sir; you bet I ain’t a cur;</line>
      <line>Strike me lucky if I don’t believe I’m lost!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>For like a mole I journey in the dark,</line>
      <line>A-travelling along the underground</line>
      <line>From my Pillar’d Halls and broad Suburbean Park,</line>
      <line>To come the daily dull official round;</line>
      <line>And home again at night with my pipe all alight,</line>
      <line>A-scheming how to count ten bob a pound.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And it’s often very cold and very wet,</line>
      <line>And my missis stitches towels for a hunks;</line>
      <line>And the Pillar’d Halls is half of it to let—</line>
      <line>Three rooms about the size of travelling trunks.</line>
      <line>And we cough, my wife and I, to dislocate a sigh,</line>
      <line>When the noisy little kids are in their bunks.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>But you never hear her do a growl or whine,</line>
      <line>For she’s made of flint and roses, very odd;</line>
      <line>And I’ve got to cut my meaning rather fine,</line>
      <line>Or I’d blubber, for I’m made of greens and sod:</line>
      <line>So p’r’aps we are in Hell for all that I can tell,</line>
      <line>And lost and damn’d and served up hot to God.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I ain’t blaspheming, Mr Silver-tongue;</line>
      <line>I’m saying things a bit beyond your art:</line>
      <line>Of all the rummy starts you ever sprung,</line>
      <line>Thirty bob a week’s the rummiest start!</line>
      <line>With your science and your books and your the’ries about spooks,</line>
      <line>Did you ever hear of looking in your heart?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I didn’t mean your pocket, Mr, no:</line>
      <line>I mean that having children and a wife,</line>
      <line>With thirty bob on which to come and go,</line>
      <line>Isn’t dancing to the tabor and the fife:</line>
      <line>When it doesn’t make you drink, by Heaven! it makes you think,</line>
      <line>And notice curious items about life.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I step into my heart and there I meet</line>
      <line>A god-almighty devil singing small,</line>
      <line>Who would like to shout and whistle in the street,</line>
      <line>And squelch the passers flat against the wall;</line>
      <line>If the whole world was a cake he had the power to take,</line>
      <line>He would take it, ask for more, and eat them all.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And I meet a sort of simpleton beside,</line>
      <line>The kind that life is always giving beans;</line>
      <line>With thirty bob a week to keep a bride</line>
      <line>He fell in love and married in his teens:</line>
      <line>At thirty bob he stuck; but he knows it isn’t luck:</line>
      <line>He knows the seas are deeper than tureens.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And the god-almighty devil and the fool</line>
      <line>That meet me in the High Street on the strike,</line>
      <line>When I walk about my heart a-gathering wool,</line>
      <line>Are my good and evil angels if you like.</line>
      <line>And both of them together in every kind of weather</line>
      <line>Ride me like a double-seated bike.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>That’s rough a bit and needs its meaning curled.</line>
      <line>But I have a high old hot un in my mind—</line>
      <line>A most engrugious notion of the world,</line>
      <line>That leaves your lightning ’rithmetic behind:</line>
      <line>I give it at a glance when I say ‘There ain’t no chance,</line>
      <line>Nor nothing of the lucky-lottery kind.’</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And it’s this way that I make it out to be:</line>
      <line>No fathers, mothers, countries, climates—none;</line>
      <line>No Adam was responsible for me,</line>
      <line>Nor society, nor systems, nary one:</line>
      <line>A little sleeping seed, I woke—I did, indeed—</line>
      <line>A million years before the blooming sun.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I woke because I thought the time had come;</line>
      <line>Beyond my will there was no other cause;</line>
      <line>And everywhere I found myself at home,</line>
      <line>Because I chose to be the thing I was;</line>
      <line>And in whatever shape of mollusc or of ape</line>
      <line>I always went according to the laws.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>I was the love that chose my mother out;</line>
      <line>I joined two lives and from the union burst;</line>
      <line>My weakness and my strength without a doubt</line>
      <line>Are mine alone for ever from the first:</line>
      <line>It’s just the very same with a difference in the name</line>
      <line>As ‘Thy will be done.’ You say it if you durst!</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>They say it daily up and down the land</line>
      <line>As easy as you take a drink, it’s true;</line>
      <line>But the difficultest go to understand,</line>
      <line>And the difficultest job a man can do,</line>
      <line>Is to come it brave and meek with thirty bob a week,</line>
      <line>And feel that that’s the proper thing for you.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>It’s a naked child against a hungry wolf;</line>
      <line>It’s playing bowls upon a splitting wreck;</line>
      <line>It’s walking on a string across a gulf</line>
      <line>With millstones fore-and-aft about your neck;</line>
      <line>But the thing is daily done by many and many a one;</line>
      <line>And we fall, face forward, fighting, on the deck.</line>

      <line>The morning’s work, a new-found theme, their breakfast and the summer day.</line>

      <line>One’s a soprano, lightly frocked</line>
      <line>In cool, white muslin that just shows</line>
      <line>Her brown silk stockings gaily clocked,</line>
      <line>Plump arms and elbows tipped with rose,</line>
      <line>And frills of petticoats and things, and outlines as the warm wind blows.</line>

    <stanza>
      <line>Here is the tale of Carrousel,</line>
      <line>The barber of Meridian Street.</line>
      <line>He cut, and coiffed, and shaved so well,</line>
      <line>That all the world was at his feet.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The King, the Queen, and all the Court,</line>
      <line>To no one else would trust their hair,</line>
      <line>And reigning belles of every sort</line>
      <line>Owed their successes to his care.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>With carriage and with cabriolet</line>
      <line>Daily Meridian Street was blocked,</line>
      <line>Like bees about a bright bouquet</line>
      <line>The beaux about his doorway flocked.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Such was his art he could with ease</line>
      <line>Curl wit into the dullest face;</line>
      <line>Or to a goddess of old Greece</line>
      <line>Add a new wonder and a grace.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>All powders, paints, and subtle dyes,</line>
      <line>And costliest scents that men distil,</line>
      <line>And rare pomades, forgot their price</line>
      <line>And marvelled at his splendid skill.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The curling irons in his hand</line>
      <line>Almost grew quick enough to speak,</line>
      <line>The razor was a magic wand</line>
      <line>That understood the softest cheek.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Yet with no pride his heart was moved;</line>
      <line>He was so modest in his ways!</line>
      <line>His dainty task was all he loved,</line>
      <line>And now and then a little praise.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>An equal care he would bestow</line>
      <line>On problems simple or complex;</line>
      <line>And nobody had seen him show</line>
      <line>A preference for either sex.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>How came it then one sunny day,</line>
      <line>Coiffing the daughter of the King,</line>
      <line>He lengthened out the least delay</line>
      <line>And loitered in his hairdressing?</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Princess was a pretty child,</line>
      <line>Thirteen years old, or thereabout.</line>
      <line>She was as joyous and as wild</line>
      <line>As spring flowers when the sun is out.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Her gold hair fell down to her feet</line>
      <line>And hung about her pretty eyes;</line>
      <line>She was as lyrical and sweet</line>
      <line>As one of Schubert’s melodies.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>Three times the barber curled a lock,</line>
      <line>And thrice he straightened it again;</line>
      <line>And twice the irons scorched her frock,</line>
      <line>And twice he stumbled in her train.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>His fingers lost their cunning quite,</line>
      <line>His ivory combs obeyed no more;</line>
      <line>Something or other dimmed his sight,</line>
      <line>And moved mysteriously the floor.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He leant upon the toilet table,</line>
      <line>His fingers fumbled in his breast;</line>
      <line>He felt as foolish as a fable,</line>
      <line>And feeble as a pointless jest.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He snatched a bottle of Cologne,</line>
      <line>And broke the neck between his hands;</line>
      <line>He felt as if he was alone,</line>
      <line>And mighty as a king’s commands.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>The Princess gave a little scream,</line>
      <line>Carrousel’s cut was sharp and deep;</line>
      <line>He left her softly as a dream</line>
      <line>That leaves a sleeper to his sleep.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>He left the room on pointed feet;</line>
      <line>Smiling that things had gone so well.</line>
      <line>They hanged him in Meridian Street.</line>
      <line>You pray in vain for Carrousel.</line>

      <line>Grow grey with nights of watching,</line>
      <line>Before your dance is done.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And it will chance some morning</line>
      <line>You will come home no more;</line>
      <line>Your wife sees but a withered leaf</line>
      <line>In the wind about the door.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And your children will inherit</line>
      <line>The unrest of the wind,</line>
      <line>They shall seek some face elusive,</line>
      <line>And some land they never find.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>When the wind is loud, they sighing</line>
      <line>Go with hearts unsatisfied,</line>
      <line>For some joy beyond remembrance,</line>
      <line>For some memory denied.</line>
    </stanza>
    <stanza>
      <line>And all your children’s children,</line>
      <line>They cannot sleep or rest,</line>
      <line>When the wind is out in Erinn</line>
      <line>And the sun is in the West.</line>
    </stanza>
